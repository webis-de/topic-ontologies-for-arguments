"2.0","2008/2009 economic crisis","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:2008/2009_economic_crisis","The Great Recession was a period of general economic decline (recession) observed in world markets during the late 2000s and early 2010s. The scale and timing of the recession varied from country to country (see map). The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has concluded that it was the most severe economic and financial meltdown since the Great Depression and it is often regarded as the second-worst downturn of all time.The Great Recession stemmed from the collapse of the United States real estate market in relation to the financial crisis of 2007–08 and the subprime mortgage crisis, though policies of other nations contributed as well. According to the nonprofit National Bureau of Economic Research, the recession in the U.S. began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009, thus extending over 19 months. The Great Recession resulted in a scarcity of valuable assets in the market economy and the collapse of the financial sector (banks) in the world economy; some banks were bailed out by the U.S. federal government.The recession was not felt equally around the world; whereas most of the world's developed economies, particularly in North America, South America and Europe, fell into a definitive recession, many more recently developed economies suffered far less impact, particularly China, India and Poland, whose economies grew substantially during this period.","debatepedia",NA
"2.1","Abortion","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Abortion","Abortion is the ending of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus before it can survive outside the uterus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or spontaneous abortion. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently ""induced miscarriage"". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. A similar procedure after the fetus has potential to survive outside the womb is known as a ""late termination of pregnancy"" or less accurately as a ""late term abortion"".When properly done, abortion is one of the safest procedures in medicine, but unsafe abortion is a major cause of maternal death, especially in the developing world. Making safe abortion legal and accessible reduces maternal deaths. It is safer than childbirth, which has a 14 times higher risk of death in the United States. Modern methods use medication or surgery for abortions. The drug mifepristone in combination with prostaglandin appears to be as safe and effective as surgery during the first and second trimester of pregnancy. The most common surgical technique involves dilating the cervix and using a suction device. Birth control, such as the pill or intrauterine devices, can be used immediately following abortion. When performed legally and safely on a woman who desires it, induced abortions do not increase the risk of long-term mental or physical problems. In contrast, unsafe abortions (those performed by unskilled individuals, with hazardous equipment, or in unsanitary facilities) cause 47,000 deaths and 5 million hospital admissions each year. The World Health Organization recommends safe and legal abortions be available to all women.Around 56 million abortions are performed each year in the world, with about 45% done unsafely. Abortion rates changed little between 2003 and 2008, before which they decreased for at least two decades as access to family planning and birth control increased. As of 2018, 37% of the world's women had access to legal abortions without limits as to reason. Countries that permit abortions have different limits on how late in pregnancy abortion is allowed.Historically, abortions have been attempted using herbal medicines, sharp tools, forceful massage, or through other traditional methods. Abortion laws and cultural or religious views of abortions are different around the world. In some areas abortion is legal only in specific cases such as rape, problems with the fetus, poverty, risk to a woman's health, or incest. There is debate over the moral, ethical, and legal issues of abortion. Those who oppose abortion often argue that an embryo or fetus is a human with a right to life, and they may compare abortion to murder. Those who support the legality of abortion often hold that it is part of a woman's right to make decisions about her own body. Others favor legal and accessible abortion as a public health measure.\n\n","debatepedia",NA
"2.2","Afghanistan","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Afghanistan","Afghanistan ( (listen); Pashto/Dari: \u0627\u0641\u063a\u0627\u0646\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646, Pashto: Af\u0121\u0101nist\u0101n [av\u0263\u0252nis\u02c8t\u0252n, ab-], Dari: Af\u0121\u0101nest\u0101n [av\u0263\u0252nes\u02c8t\u0252n]), officially the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, is a landlocked country in Asia. Afghanistan is bordered by Pakistan to the east and south; Iran to the west; Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan to the north; and China to the northeast. Occupying 652,000 square kilometers (252,000 sq mi), it is a mountainous country with plains in the north and southwest. Kabul is the capital and largest city.  The population is around 38 million, mostly composed of ethnic Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazaras and Uzbeks.\nHuman habitation in Afghanistan dates back to the Middle Paleolithic Era, and the country's strategic location along the Silk Road connected it to the cultures of the Middle East and other parts of Asia. The land has historically been home to various peoples and has witnessed numerous military campaigns, including those by Alexander the Great, Mauryas, Muslim Arabs, Mongols, British, Soviets, and by the United States with allied countries. The land also served as the source from which the Kushans, Hephthalites, Samanids, Saffarids, Ghaznavids, Ghorids, Khaljis, Mughals, Hotaks, Durranis, and others have risen to form major empires.\nThe political history of the modern state of Afghanistan began with the Hotak and Durrani dynasties in the 18th century, with Ahmad Shah Abdali being considered as the founder of the state. In the late 19th century, Afghanistan became a buffer state in the ""Great Game"" between British India and the Russian Empire. Its border with British India, the Durand Line, was formed in 1893 but it is not recognized by the Afghan government and it has led to strained relations with Pakistan since the latter's independence in 1947. Following the Third Anglo-Afghan War in 1919 the country was free of foreign influence, eventually becoming a monarchy under Amanullah Khan, until almost 50 years later when Zahir Shah was overthrown and a republic was established. In 1978, after a second coup Afghanistan first became a socialist state and then a Soviet protectorate. This evoked the Soviet\u2013Afghan War in the 1980s against mujahideen rebels. By 1996 most of Afghanistan was captured by the Islamic fundamentalist group the Taliban, who ruled as a totalitarian regime for over five years. Following the 9/11 attacks, an intervention by the US and its allies forcibly removed the Taliban from power, and a new democratically-elected government was formed, but the Taliban still control a significant portion of the country.\nAfghanistan is a unitary presidential Islamic republic. The country has high levels of terrorism, poverty, child malnutrition, and corruption. It is a member of the United Nations, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, the Group of 77, the Economic Cooperation Organization, and the Non-Aligned Movement. Afghanistan's economy is the world's 96th largest, with a gross domestic product (GDP) of $72.9 billion by purchasing power parity; the country fares much worse in terms of per-capita GDP (PPP), ranking 169th out of 186 countries as of 2018.","debatepedia",NA
"2.3","Africa","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Africa","Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most populous continent, after Asia. At about 30.3 million km2 (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20% of its land area. With\n1.3 billion people as of 2018, it accounts for about 16% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, the Isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognised sovereign states (countries), four territories and two de facto independent states with limited or no recognition. The majority of the continent and its countries are in the Northern Hemisphere, with a substantial portion and number of countries in the Southern Hemisphere.\nAfrica's average population is the youngest amongst all the continents; the median age in 2012 was 19.7, when the worldwide median age was 30.4. Algeria is Africa's largest country by area, and Nigeria is its largest by population. Africa, particularly central Eastern Africa, is widely accepted as the place of origin of humans and the Hominidae clade (great apes), as evidenced by the discovery of the earliest hominids and their ancestors as well as later ones that have been dated to around 7 million years ago, including Sahelanthropus tchadensis, Australopithecus africanus, A. afarensis, Homo erectus, H. habilis and H. ergaster\u2014the earliest Homo sapiens (modern human), found in Ethiopia, date to circa 200,000 years ago. Africa straddles the equator and encompasses numerous climate areas; it is the only continent to stretch from the northern temperate to southern temperate zones.Africa hosts a large diversity of ethnicities, cultures and languages. In the late 19th century, European countries colonised almost all of Africa; most present states in Africa emerged from a process of decolonisation in the 20th century. African nations cooperate through the establishment of the African Union, which is headquartered in Addis Ababa.","debatepedia",NA
"2.4","Animal rights","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Animal_rights","Animal rights is the idea in which some, or all, non-human animals are entitled to the possession of their own existence and that their most basic interests\u2014such as the need to avoid suffering\u2014should be afforded the same consideration as similar interests of human beings. That is, animals have the right to be treated as the individuals they are, with their own desires and needs, rather than as unfeeling property.Its advocates oppose the assignment of moral value and fundamental protections on the basis of species membership alone\u2014an idea known since 1970 as speciesism, when the term was coined by Richard D. Ryder\u2014arguing that it is a prejudice as irrational as any other. They maintain that animals should no longer be viewed as property or used as food, clothing, research subjects, entertainment, or beasts of burden. Multiple cultural traditions around the world such as Jainism, Taoism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Shintoism and Animism also espouse some forms of animal rights.\nIn parallel to the debate about moral rights, animal law is now widely taught in law schools in North America, and several prominent legal scholars, such as Steven M. Wise and Gary L. Francione, support the extension of basic legal rights and personhood to non-human animals. The animals most often considered in arguments for personhood are hominoids. This is supported by some animal rights academics because it would break through the species barrier, but opposed by others because it predicates moral value on mental complexity, rather than on sentience alone. As of November 2019, 29 countries have currently enacted bans on hominoid experimentation, and Argentina has granted a captive orangutan basic human rights since 2014.Critics of animal rights argue that nonhuman animals are unable to enter into a social contract, and thus cannot be possessors of rights, a view summed up by the philosopher Roger Scruton, who writes that only humans have duties, and therefore only humans have rights. Another argument, associated with the utilitarian tradition, is that animals may be used as resources so long as there is no unnecessary suffering; they may have some moral standing, but they are inferior in status to human beings, and any interests they have may be overridden, though what counts as ""necessary"" suffering or a legitimate sacrifice of interests varies considerably. Certain forms of animal rights activism, such as the destruction of fur farms and animal laboratories by the Animal Liberation Front, have also attracted criticism, including from within the animal rights movement itself, as well as prompted reaction from the U.S. Congress with the enactment of laws allowing these activities to be prosecuted as terrorism, including the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act.","debatepedia",NA
"2.5","Asia","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Asia","Asia ( (listen)) is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the Eastern and Northern Hemispheres. It shares the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe and the continental landmass of Afro-Eurasia with both Europe and Africa. Asia covers an area of 44,579,000 square kilometres (17,212,000 sq mi), about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements, as well as vast barely populated regions. Its 4.5 billion people (as of June 2019) constitute roughly 60% of the world's population, more than all other continents combined.In general terms, Asia is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean, and on the north by the Arctic Ocean. The border of Asia with Europe is a historical and cultural construct, as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them. It is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in classical antiquity. The division of Eurasia into two continents reflects East\u2013West cultural, linguistic, and ethnic differences, some of which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line. The most commonly accepted boundaries place Asia to the east of the Suez Canal separating it from Africa; and to the east of the Turkish Straits, the Ural Mountains and Ural River, and to the south of the Caucasus Mountains and the Caspian and Black Seas, separating it from Europe.China and India alternated in being the largest economies in the world from 1 to 1800 CE. China was a major economic power and attracted many to the east, and for many the legendary wealth and prosperity of the ancient culture of India personified Asia, attracting European commerce, exploration and colonialism. The accidental discovery of a trans-Atlantic route from Europe to America by Columbus while in search for a route to India demonstrates this deep fascination. The Silk Road became the main east\u2013west trading route in the Asian hinterlands while the Straits of Malacca stood as a major sea route. Asia has exhibited economic dynamism (particularly East Asia) as well as robust population growth during the 20th century, but overall population growth has since fallen. Asia was the birthplace of most of the world's mainstream religions including Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Jainism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, Christianity, Islam, Sikhism, as well as many other religions.\nGiven its size and diversity, the concept of Asia\u2014a name dating back to classical antiquity\u2014may actually have more to do with human geography than physical geography. Asia varies greatly across and within its regions with regard to ethnic groups, cultures, environments, economics, historical ties and government systems. It also has a mix of many different climates ranging from the equatorial south via the hot desert in the Middle East, temperate areas in the east and the  continental centre to vast subarctic and polar areas in Siberia.","debatepedia",NA

"2.8","Bush administration","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Bush_administration","The presidency of George W. Bush began at noon EST on January 20, 2001, when George W. Bush was inaugurated as the 43rd president of the United States, and ended on January 20, 2009. Bush, a Republican, took office following a very close victory over Democratic incumbent vice president Al Gore in the 2000 presidential election. Four years later, in the 2004 election, he defeated Democrat John Kerry to win re-election. Bush, the 43rd president, is the eldest son of the 41st president, George H. W. Bush. He was succeeded by Democrat Barack Obama, who won the 2008 presidential election.\nUpon taking office, Bush pushed through a $1.3 trillion tax cut program and the No Child Left Behind Act, a major education bill. He also pushed for socially conservative efforts, such as the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act and faith-based welfare initiatives. After the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, Bush declared a global war on terrorism and, in October 2001, ordered an invasion of Afghanistan to overthrow the Taliban, destroy the terrorist group al-Qaeda, and capture Osama bin Laden. That same month, he signed into law the controversial Patriot Act in order to authorize surveillance of suspected terrorists. In 2003, Bush ordered an invasion of Iraq, asserting that Iraq possessed stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction in violation of UN Security Council Resolution 1441. Later that year, he signed the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act, which created Medicare Part D.\nDuring his second term, Bush reached multiple free trade agreements and successfully nominated John G. Roberts and Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court. He sought major changes to Social Security and immigration laws, but both efforts failed. The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq continued, and in 2007 he launched a surge of troops in Iraq. The Bush administration's response to Hurricane Katrina and the dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy earned wide coverage, and his second term saw a drop in his approval ratings. A global meltdown in financial markets dominated his last days in office as policymakers looked to avert a major economic disaster, and he established the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) to buy toxic assets from financial institutions. Scholars have generally ranked Bush as a below average president.","debatepedia",NA
"2.9","Business","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Business","Business is the activity of making one's living or making money by producing or buying and selling products (such as goods and services). Simply put, it is ""any activity or enterprise entered into for profit. It does not mean it is a company, a corporation, partnership, or have any such formal organization, but it can range from a street peddler to General Motors.""Having a business name does not separate the business entity from the owner, which means that the owner of the business is responsible and liable for debts incurred by the business.  If the business acquires debts, the creditors can go after the owner's personal possessions.  A business structure does not allow for corporate tax rates. The proprietor is personally taxed on all income from the business.\nThe term is also often used colloquially (but not by lawyers or by public officials) to refer to a company. A company, on the other hand, is a separate legal entity and provides for limited liability, as well as corporate tax rates.  A company structure is more complicated and expensive to set up, but offers more protection and benefits for the owner.","debatepedia",NA

"2.11","China","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:China","China (Chinese: \u4e2d\u56fd; pinyin: Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3), officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a country in East Asia and is the world's most populous country, with a population of around 1.428 billion in 2017. Covering approximately 9,600,000 square kilometers (3,700,000 sq mi), it is the third largest country by area. Governed by the Communist Party of China, the state exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau.\nChina emerged as one of the world's first civilizations, in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain. For millennia, China's political system was based on hereditary monarchies, or dynasties, beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE. Since then, China has expanded, fractured, and re-unified numerous times. In the 3rd century BCE, the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire. The succeeding Han dynasty, which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE, saw some of the most advanced technology at that time, including papermaking and the compass, along with agricultural and medical improvements. The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907) and Northern Song (960\u20131127) completed the Four Great Inventions. Tang culture spread widely in Asia, as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa. Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the Xinhai Revolution, when the Republic of China (ROC) replaced the Qing dynasty. China, as a whole, was ravaged by feudal warlordism and Japan during World War II. The subsequent Chinese Civil War resulted in a division of territory in 1949 when the Communist Party of China led by Mao Zedong established the People's Republic of China on mainland China while the Kuomintang-led nationalist government retreated to the island of Taiwan where it governed until 1996 when Taiwan transitioned to democracy. The political status of Taiwan remains disputed to this day.\nChina is a unitary one-party socialist republic and is one of the few existing socialist states. Political dissidents and human rights groups have denounced and criticized the Chinese government for human rights abuses, suppression of religious and ethnic minorities, censorship and mass surveillance, and cracking down on protests such as in 1989. The Chinese government says that the right to subsistence and economic development is a prerequisite to other types of human rights and that the notion of human rights should take into account a country's present economic level.\nSince the introduction of economic reforms in 1978, China's economy has been one of the world's fastest-growing with annual growth rates consistently above 6 percent. According to the World Bank, China's GDP grew from $150 billion in 1978 to $12.24 trillion by 2017. According to official data, China's GDP in 2018 was 90 trillion Yuan ($13.5 trillion). Since 2010, China has been the world's second-largest economy by nominal GDP, and since 2014, the largest economy in the world by purchasing power parity. China is also the world's largest exporter and second-largest importer of goods. China is a recognized nuclear weapons state and has the world's largest standing army, the People's Liberation Army, and the second-largest defense budget. The PRC is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council as it replaced the ROC in 1971, as well as an active global partner of ASEAN Plus mechanism. Since 2019, China has the highest number of rich people in the world. China has been characterized as a potential superpower, mainly because of its massive population, large and rapidly-growing economy, and powerful military.","debatepedia",NA
"2.12","Christianity","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Christianity","Christianity is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth. Its adherents, known as Christians, believe that Jesus is the Christ, whose coming as the messiah was prophesied in the Hebrew Bible, called the Old Testament in Christianity, and chronicled in the New Testament. It is the world's largest religion with about 2.4 billion followers.Christianity began as a Second Temple Judaic sect in the 1st century in the Roman province of Judea. Jesus' apostles and their followers spread around Syria, the Levant, Europe, Anatolia, Mesopotamia, Transcaucasia, Egypt, and Ethiopia, despite initial persecution. It soon attracted gentile God-fearers, which led to a departure from Jewish customs, and, after the Fall of Jerusalem, AD 70 which ended the Temple-based Judaism, Christianity slowly separated from Judaism. Emperor Constantine the Great decriminalized Christianity in the Roman Empire by the Edict of Milan (313), later convening the Council of Nicaea (325) where Early Christianity was consolidated into what would become the State church of the Roman Empire (380). Constantine converted to Christianity before his death (337). The early history of Christianity's united church before major schisms is sometimes referred to as the ""Great Church"". The Church of the East split after the Council of Ephesus (431) and Oriental Orthodoxy split after the Council of Chalcedon (451) over differences in Christology, while the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church separated in the East\u2013West Schism (1054), especially over the authority of the bishop of Rome. Similarly, Protestantism split in numerous denominations from the Latin Catholic Church in the Reformation era (16th century) over theological and ecclesiological disputes, most predominantly on the issue of justification and the primacy of the bishop of Rome. Following the Age of Discovery (15th\u201317th century), Christianity was spread into the Americas, Oceania, sub-Saharan Africa, and the rest of the world via missionary work.Christianity remains culturally diverse in its Western and Eastern branches, as well as in its doctrines concerning justification and the nature of salvation, ecclesiology, ordination, and Christology. The four largest branches of Christianity are the Catholic Church (1.3 billion/50.1%), Protestantism (920 million/36.7%), the Eastern Orthodox Church (260 million) and Oriental Orthodoxy (86 million/both together 11.9%), amid various efforts toward unity (ecumenism). Their creeds generally hold in common Jesus as the Son of God\u2014the logos incarnated\u2014who ministered, suffered, and died on a cross, but rose from the dead for the salvation of mankind; as referred to as the gospel, meaning the ""good news"", in the Bible (scripture). Describing Jesus' life and teachings are the four canonical gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John with the Jewish Old Testament as the gospel's respected background.\nChristianity and Christian ethics played a prominent role in the development of Western civilization, particularly around Europe from late antiquity and the Middle Ages. Despite a decline in adherence in the West, Christianity remains the dominant religion in the region, with about 70% of the population identifying as Christian. Christianity is growing in Africa and Asia, the world's most populous continents. Christians are the most persecuted religious group in the world, especially in the Middle-East, North Africa and South Asia.","debatepedia",NA
"2.13","Church and state","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Church_and_state","The separation of church and state is a philosophic and jurisprudential concept for defining political distance in the relationship between religious organizations and the nation state. Conceptually, the term refers to the creation of a secular state (with or without legally explicit church\u2013state separation) and to disestablishment, the changing of an existing, formal relationship between the church and the state.In a society, the degree of political separation between the church and the civil state is determined by the legal structures and prevalent legal views that define the proper relationship between organized religion and the state. The arm's length principle proposes a relationship wherein the two political entities interact as organizations each independent of the authority of the other. The strict application of the secular principle of la\u00efcit\u00e9 (secularity) is used in France, while secular societies, such as Denmark and the United Kingdom, maintain a form of constitutional recognition of an official state religion.The philosophy of the separation of the church from the civil state parallels the philosophies of secularism, disestablishmentarianism, religious liberty, and religious pluralism, by way of which the European states assumed some of the social roles of the church, the welfare state, a social shift that produced a culturally secular population and public sphere. In practice, church\u2013state separation varies from total separation, mandated by the country's political constitution, as in India and Singapore, to a state religion, as in the Maldives.","debatepedia",NA
"2.14","Cities","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Cities","A city is a large human settlement. It can be defined as a permanent and densely settled place with administratively defined boundaries whose members work primarily on non-agricultural tasks. Cities generally have extensive systems for housing, transportation, sanitation, utilities, land use, and communication. Their density facilitates interaction between people, government organisations and businesses, sometimes benefiting different parties in the process, such as improving efficiency of goods and service distribution. This concentration also can have significant negative consequences, such as forming urban heat islands, concentrating pollution, and stressing water supplies and other resources. \nHistorically, city-dwellers have been a small proportion of humanity overall, but following two centuries of unprecedented and rapid urbanisation, roughly half of the world population now lives in cities, which has had profound consequences for global sustainability. Present-day cities usually form the core of larger metropolitan areas and urban areas\u2014creating numerous commuters traveling towards city centres for employment, entertainment, and edification. However, in a world of intensifying globalisation, all cities are in different degree also connected globally beyond these regions. This increased influence means that cities also have significant influences on global issues, such as sustainable development, global warming and global health.\nOther important traits of cities besides population include the capital status and relative continued occupation of the city. For example, country capitals such as Abu Dhabi, Beijing, Berlin, Cairo, Dubai, London, Moscow, Paris, Rome, Seoul, Tokyo, and Washington D.C. reflect their nation's identity. Some historic capitals, such as Kyoto, maintain their reflection of cultural identity even without modern capital status. Religious holy sites offer another example of capital status within a religion, Jerusalem, Mecca, and Varanasi each hold significance. The cities of Faiyum, Damascus, and Argos are among those laying claim to the longest continual inhabitation. In terms of relative age, the oldest cities in the Americas are Cholula near Puebla, Flor\u00e9s in Pet\u00e9n, and Acoma near Albuquerque, while the oldest capital cities in the Americas are Mexico City, Santo Domingo, and San Juan. Another example of relative age, is in the age of the oldest capital cities of the superpower and emerging superpower, they are the U.S. state capital of Santa Fe, New Mexico, and the Chinese prefecture capital of Xi'an, Shaanxi.","debatepedia",NA
"2.15","Climate change","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Climate_change","Global warming is the long-term rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system. It is a major aspect of climate change and has been demonstrated by direct temperature measurements and by measurements of various effects of the warming. Global warming and climate change are often used interchangeably. But, more accurately, global warming is the mainly human-caused increase in global surface temperatures and its projected continuation, while climate change includes both global warming and its effects, such as changes in precipitation. While there have been prehistoric periods of global warming, observed changes since the mid-20th century have been unprecedented in rate and scale.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report concluded, ""It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century"". The largest human influence has been the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. Fossil fuel burning is the dominant source of these gases, with agricultural emissions and deforestation also playing significant roles. These findings have been recognized by the national science academies of the major industrialized nations and are not disputed by any scientific body of national or international standing.The effects of global warming include rising sea levels, regional changes in precipitation, more frequent extreme weather events such as heat waves, and expansion of deserts. Surface temperature increases are greatest in the Arctic, which have contributed to the retreat of glaciers, permafrost, and sea ice. Overall, higher temperatures bring more rain and snowfall, but for some regions droughts and wildfires increase instead. Climate change threatens to diminish crop yields, harming food security, and rising sea levels may flood coastal infrastructure and force the abandonment of many coastal cities. Environmental impacts include the extinction or relocation of many species as their ecosystems change, most immediately in coral reefs, mountains, and the Arctic. Some impacts, such as loss of snow cover, increased water vapour, and melting permafrost, cause feedback effects that further increase the rate of global warming. Ocean acidification caused by increased CO2 levels is commonly grouped with these effects even though it is not driven by temperature.\nMitigation efforts to address global warming include the development and deployment of low carbon energy technologies, policies to reduce fossil fuel emissions, reforestation, forest preservation, as well as the development of potential climate engineering technologies. Societies and governments are also working to adapt to current and future global warming impacts, including improved coastline protection, better disaster management, and the development of more resistant crops. \nCountries work together on climate change under the umbrella of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which entered into force in 1994 and has near-universal membership. The ultimate goal of the convention is to ""prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system"". Although the parties to the UNFCCC have agreed that deep cuts in emissions are required and that global warming should be limited to well below 2 \u00b0C (3.6 \u00b0F) in the Paris Agreement of 2016, the Earth's average surface temperature has already increased by about half this threshold. With current policies and pledges, global warming by the end of the century is expected to reach just over 2 \u00b0C to 4 \u00b0C, depending on how sensitive the climate is to emissions. The IPCC has stressed the need to keep global warming below 1.5 \u00b0C compared to pre-industrial levels in order to avoid irreversible impacts. At the current greenhouse gas (GHG) emission rate of 42 gigatons (Gt) per year, the carbon budget for staying below 1.5\u00b0C would be exhausted by 2028.\n\n","debatepedia",NA
"2.16","Conflict","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Conflict","Group conflict, or hostilities between different groups, is a feature common to all forms of human social organization (e.g., sports teams, ethnic groups, nations, religions, gangs), and also occurs in social animals. Although group conflict is one of the most complex phenomena studied by social scientists, the history of the human race evidences a series of group-level conflicts that have gained notoriety over the years. For example, from 1820 to 1945, it has been estimated that at least 59 million persons were killed during conflicts between groups of one type or another. Literature suggests that the number of fatalities nearly doubled between the years 1914 to 1964 as a result of further group conflict.Group conflict can be separated into two sub-categories of conflict: inter-group conflict (in which distinct groups of individuals are at odds with one another), and intra-group conflict (in which select individuals that are part of the same group clash with one another). Although both forms of conflict have the ability to spiral upward in severity, it has been noted that conflict present at the group level (i.e., inter-group rivalries) is generally considered to be more powerful than conflict present at an individual level – a phenomenon known as the discontinuity effect.","debatepedia",NA
"2.17","Corruption","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Corruption","Corruption is a form of dishonesty or criminal offense undertaken by a person or organization entrusted with a position of authority, to acquire illicit benefit or abuse power for one's private gain. Corruption may include many activities including bribery and embezzlement, though it may also involve practices that are legal in many countries. Political corruption occurs when an office-holder or other governmental employee acts in an official capacity for personal gain. Corruption is most commonplace in kleptocracies, oligarchies, narco-states and mafia states.Corruption can occur on different scales. Corruption ranges from small favors between a small number of people (petty corruption), to corruption that affects the government on a large scale (grand corruption), and corruption that is so prevalent that it is part of the everyday structure of society, including corruption as one of the symptoms of organized crime. Corruption and crime are endemic sociological occurrences which appear with regular frequency in virtually all countries on a global scale in varying degree and proportion. Individual nations each allocate domestic resources for the control and regulation of corruption and crime. Strategies to counter corruption are often summarized under the umbrella term anti-corruption.\n\n","debatepedia",NA
"2.18","Crime","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Crime","In ordinary language, a crime is an unlawful act punishable by a state or other authority. The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law. One proposed definition is that a crime or offence (or criminal offence) is an act harmful not only to some individual but also to a community, society, or the state (""a public wrong""). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.The notion that acts such as murder, rape, and theft are to be prohibited exists worldwide. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.\nThe state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. In modern societies, there are procedures to which investigations and trials must adhere. If found guilty, an offender may be sentenced to a form of reparation such as a community sentence, or, depending on the nature of their offence, to undergo imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, execution.\nUsually, to be classified as a crime, the ""act of doing something criminal"" (actus reus) must \u2013 with certain exceptions \u2013 be accompanied by the ""intention to do something criminal"" (mens rea).While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime. Breaches of private law (torts and breaches of contract) are not automatically punished by the state, but can be enforced through civil procedure.\n\n","debatepedia",NA
"2.19","Culture","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Culture","Culture () is an umbrella term which encompasses the social behavior and norms found in human societies, as well as the knowledge, beliefs, arts, laws, customs, capabilities and habits of the individuals in these groups.Humans acquire culture through the learning processes of enculturation and socialization, which is shown by the diversity of cultures across societies.\nA cultural norm codifies acceptable conduct in society; it serves as a guideline for behavior, dress, language, and demeanor in a situation, which serves as a template for expectations in a social group.\nAccepting only a monoculture in a social group can bear risks, just as a single species can wither in the face of environmental change, for lack of functional responses to the change. \nThus in military culture, valor is counted a typical behavior for an individual, as are duty, honor, and loyalty to the social group are counted as virtues or functional responses in the continuum of conflict. In the practice of religion, analogous attributes can be identified in a social group.\n\n","debatepedia",NA
"2.20","Democracy","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Democracy","Democracy (Greek: \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1 d\u0113mokrat\u00eda, ""rule by [the] people"") is a form of government in which the people exercise the authority of government. Who people are and how authority is shared among them are core issues for democratic development and constitution. Some cornerstones of these issues are  freedom of assembly and speech, inclusiveness and equality, membership, consent, voting, right to life and minority rights.\nGenerally, there are two types of democracy: direct and representative. In a direct democracy, the people directly deliberate and decide on legislature. In a representative democracy the people elect representatives to deliberate and decide on legislature, such as in parliamentary or presidential democracy. Liquid democracy combines elements of these two basic types.\nThe most common decision making approach of democracies has been the majority rule. Others are supermajority and consensus.\nIn the common variant of liberal democracy the powers of the majority are exercised within the framework of a representative democracy, but the constitution limits the majority and protects the minority, usually through the enjoyment by all of certain individual rights, e.g. freedom of speech, or freedom of association.\nBesides these general types of democracy, there have been a wealth of further types (see below). Republics, though often associated with democracy because of the shared principle of rule by consent of the governed, are not necessarily democracies, as republicanism does not specify how the people are to rule.Democracy is a system of processing conflicts in which outcomes depend on what participants do, but no single force controls what occurs and its outcomes. The uncertainty of outcomes is inherent in democracy. Democracy makes all forces struggle repeatedly to realize their interests and devolves power from groups of people to sets of rules. Western democracy, as distinct from that which existed in pre-modern societies, is generally considered to have originated in city-states such as Classical Athens and the Roman Republic, where various schemes and degrees of enfranchisement of the free male population were observed before the form disappeared in the West at the beginning of late antiquity. The English word dates back to the 16th century, from the older Middle French and Middle Latin equivalents.\nAccording to American political scientist Larry Diamond, democracy consists of four key elements: a political system for choosing and replacing the government through free and fair elections; the active participation of the people, as citizens, in politics and civic life; protection of the human rights of all citizens; a rule of law, in which the laws and procedures apply equally to all citizens. Todd Landman, nevertheless, draws our attention to the fact that democracy and human rights are two different concepts and that ""there must be greater specificity in the conceptualisation and operationalisation of democracy and human rights"".The term appeared in the 5th century BC to denote the political systems then existing in Greek city-states, notably Athens, to mean ""rule of the people"", in contrast to aristocracy (\u1f00\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1, aristokrat\u00eda), meaning ""rule of an elite"". While theoretically, these definitions are in opposition, in practice the distinction has been blurred historically. The political system of Classical Athens, for example, granted democratic citizenship to free men and excluded slaves and women from political participation. In virtually all democratic governments throughout ancient and modern history, democratic citizenship consisted of an elite class, until full enfranchisement was won for all adult citizens in most modern democracies through the suffrage movements of the 19th and 20th centuries.\nDemocracy contrasts with forms of government where power is either held by an individual, as in an absolute monarchy, or where power is held by a small number of individuals, as in an oligarchy. Nevertheless, these oppositions, inherited from Greek philosophy, are now ambiguous because contemporary governments have mixed democratic, oligarchic and monarchic elements. Karl Popper defined democracy in contrast to dictatorship or tyranny, thus focusing on opportunities for the people to control their leaders and to oust them without the need for a revolution.","debatepedia",NA
"2.21","Disease","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Disease","A disease is a particular abnormal condition that negatively affects the structure or function of all or part of an organism, and that is not due to any immediate external injury. Diseases are often known to be medical conditions that are associated with specific symptoms and signs. A disease may be caused by external factors such as pathogens or by internal dysfunctions.  For example, internal dysfunctions of the immune system can produce a variety of different diseases, including various forms of immunodeficiency, hypersensitivity, allergies and autoimmune disorders.\nIn humans, disease is often used more broadly to refer to any condition that causes pain, dysfunction, distress, social problems, or death to the person afflicted, or similar problems for those in contact with the person. In this broader sense, it sometimes includes injuries, disabilities, disorders, syndromes, infections, isolated symptoms, deviant behaviors, and atypical variations of structure and function, while in other contexts and for other purposes these may be considered distinguishable categories. Diseases can affect people not only physically, but also mentally, as contracting and living with a disease can alter the affected person's perspective on life.\nDeath due to disease is called death by natural causes. There are four main types of disease: infectious diseases, deficiency diseases, hereditary diseases (including both genetic diseases and non-genetic hereditary diseases), and physiological diseases. Diseases can also be classified in other ways, such as communicable versus non-communicable diseases. The deadliest diseases in humans are coronary artery disease (blood flow obstruction), followed by cerebrovascular disease and lower respiratory infections.  In developed countries, the diseases that cause the most sickness overall are neuropsychiatric conditions, such as depression and anxiety.\nThe study of disease is called pathology, which includes the study of etiology, or cause.","debatepedia",NA
"2.22","Drugs","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Drugs","A drug () is any substance that causes a change in an organism's physiology or psychology when consumed. Drugs are typically distinguished from food and substances that provide nutritional support. Consumption of drugs can be via inhalation, injection, smoking, ingestion, absorption via a patch on the skin, or dissolution under the tongue.\nIn pharmacology, a drug is a chemical substance, typically of known structure, which, when administered to a living organism, produces a biological effect. A pharmaceutical drug, also called a medication or medicine, is a chemical substance used to treat, cure, prevent, or diagnose a disease or to promote well-being. Traditionally drugs were obtained through extraction from medicinal plants, but more recently also by organic synthesis. Pharmaceutical drugs may be used for a limited duration, or on a regular basis for chronic disorders.Pharmaceutical drugs are often classified into drug classes\u2014groups of related drugs that have similar chemical structures, the same mechanism of action (binding to the same biological target), a related mode of action, and that are used to treat the same disease. The Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System (ATC), the most widely used drug classification system, assigns drugs a unique ATC code, which is an alphanumeric code that assigns it to specific drug classes within the ATC system. Another major classification system is the Biopharmaceutics Classification System. This classifies drugs according to their solubility and permeability or absorption properties.Psychoactive drugs are chemical substances that affect the function of the central nervous system, altering perception, mood or consciousness. These drugs are divided into different groups like: stimulants, depressants, antidepressants, anxiolytics, antipsychotics, and hallucinogens. These psychoactive drugs have been proven useful in treating wide range of medical conditions including mental disorders around the world. The most widely used drugs in the world include caffeine, nicotine and alcohol, which are also considered recreational drugs, since they are used for pleasure rather than medicinal purposes. Abuse of several psychoactive drugs can cause psychological or physical addiction. It's worth noting that all drugs can have potential side effects. Excessive use of stimulants can promote stimulant psychosis. Many recreational drugs are illicit and international treaties such as the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs exist for the purpose of their prohibition.","debatepedia",NA
"2.23","Economics","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Economics","Economics () is the social science that studies the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services.Economics focuses on the behaviour and interactions of economic agents and how economies work. Microeconomics analyzes basic elements in the economy, including individual agents and markets, their interactions, and the outcomes of interactions. Individual agents may include, for example, households, firms, buyers, and sellers. Macroeconomics analyzes the entire economy (meaning aggregated production, consumption, saving, and investment) and issues affecting it, including unemployment of resources (labour, capital, and land), inflation, economic growth, and the public policies that address these issues (monetary, fiscal, and other policies).  See glossary of economics.\nOther broad distinctions within economics include those between positive economics, describing ""what is"", and normative economics, advocating ""what ought to be""; between economic theory and applied economics; between rational and behavioural economics; and between mainstream economics and heterodox economics.Economic analysis can be applied throughout society, in real estate, business, finance, health care, and government. Economic analysis is sometimes also applied to such diverse subjects as crime, education, the family, law, politics, religion, social institutions, war, science, and the environment.","debatepedia",NA

Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners can also educate themselves.  Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.\nFormal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.\nA right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations.

"2.25","Elections","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Elections","An election is a formal group decision-making process by which a population chooses an individual to hold public office. It is usually used in Democratic nations.\nElections have been the usual mechanism by which modern representative democracy has operated since the 17th century. Elections may fill offices in the legislature, sometimes in the executive and judiciary, and for regional and local government. This process is also used in many other private and business organizations, from clubs to voluntary associations and corporations.The universal use of elections as a tool for selecting representatives in modern representative democracies is in contrast with the practice in the democratic archetype, ancient Athens, where the Elections were not used were considered an oligarchic institution and most political offices were filled using sortition, also known as allotment, by which officeholders were chosen by lot.Electoral reform describes the process of introducing fair electoral systems where they are not in place, or improving the fairness or effectiveness of existing systems. Psephology is the study of results and other statistics relating to elections (especially with a view to predicting future results).\nTo elect means ""to select or make a decision"", and so sometimes other forms of ballot such as referendums are referred to as elections, especially in the United States.","debatepedia",NA
"2.26","Energy","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Energy","In physics, energy is the quantitative property that must be transferred to an object in order to perform work on, or to heat, the object.  Energy is a conserved quantity; the law of conservation of energy states that energy can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed. The SI unit of energy is the joule, which is the energy transferred to an object by the work of moving it a distance of 1 metre against a force of 1 newton.\nCommon forms of energy include the kinetic energy of a moving object, the potential energy stored by an object's position in a force field (gravitational, electric or magnetic), the elastic energy stored by stretching solid objects, the chemical energy released when a fuel burns, the radiant energy carried by light, and the thermal energy due to an object's temperature.\nMass and energy are closely related. Due to mass\u2013energy equivalence, any object that has mass when stationary (called rest mass) also has an equivalent amount of energy whose form is called rest energy, and any additional energy (of any form) acquired by the object above that rest energy will increase the object's total mass just as it increases its total energy. For example, after heating an object, its increase in energy could be measured as a small increase in mass, with a sensitive enough scale.\nLiving organisms require energy to stay alive, such as the energy humans get from food.  Human civilization requires energy to function, which it gets from  energy resources such as fossil fuels, nuclear fuel, or renewable energy. The processes of Earth's climate and ecosystem are driven by the radiant energy Earth receives from the sun and the geothermal energy contained within the earth.","debatepedia",NA
"2.27","Entertainment","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Entertainment","Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.\nThe experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.\nAn important aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, as in the case of persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, as in the case of games, where the participant/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion for example with stage magic. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.\nSome entertainment, such as public executions, are now illegal in most countries. Activities such as fencing or archery, once used in hunting or war, have become spectator sports. In the same way, other activities, such as cooking, have developed into performances among professionals, staged as global competitions and then broadcast for entertainment. What is entertainment for one group or individual may be regarded as work or an act of cruelty by another.\nThe familiar forms of entertainment have the capacity to cross over different media and have demonstrated a seemingly unlimited potential for creative remix. This has ensured the continuity and longevity of many themes, images, and structures.\n\n[[File:Cylindrical vessel with ballgame scene, Maya, Ik' Emblem Glyph site, Motul de San Jose area, El Peten area, Guatemala, Late Classic period, c. 700-850 AD, ceramic - Dallas Museum of Art - DSC04634.jpg|thumb|Mesoamerican ballgame (Maya Central lowlands, 650\u2013800 CE).

"2.29","Europe","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Europe","Europe is a continent located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere.  It comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia and is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and Asia to the east. The eastern border comprises a long and mixed line of mountain ranges and waterways that would normally define a subcontinent. However, Europe is generally accorded the status of a full continent because of its great physical size and the weight of history and tradition. It is the 6th largest continent in the world.\nEurope is commonly considered to be separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas and the waterways of the Turkish Straits.Europe covers about 10,180,000 square kilometres (3,930,000 sq mi), or 2% of the Earth's surface (6.8% of land area). Politically, Europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states of which Russia is the largest and most populous, spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population. Europe had a total population of about 741 million (about 11% of the world population) as of 2018. The European climate is largely affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent, even at latitudes along which the climate in Asia and North America is severe. Further from the sea, seasonal differences are more noticeable than close to the coast.\nEurope, in particular ancient Greece and ancient Rome, was the birthplace of Western civilisation. The fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD and the subsequent Migration Period marked the end of ancient history and the beginning of the Middle Ages. Renaissance humanism, exploration, art and science led to the modern era. Since the Age of Discovery started by Portugal and Spain, Europe played a predominant role in global affairs. Between the 16th and 20th centuries, European powers controlled at various times the Americas, almost all of Africa and Oceania and the majority of Asia.\nThe Age of Enlightenment, the subsequent French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars shaped the continent culturally, politically and economically from the end of the 17th century until the first half of the 19th century. The Industrial Revolution, which began in Great Britain at the end of the 18th century, gave rise to radical economic, cultural and social change in Western Europe and eventually the wider world. Both world wars took place for the most part in Europe, contributing to a decline in Western European dominance in world affairs by the mid-20th century as the Soviet Union and the United States took prominence. During the Cold War, Europe was divided along the Iron Curtain between NATO in the West and the Warsaw Pact in the East, until the revolutions of 1989 and fall of the Berlin Wall.\nIn 1949 the Council of Europe was founded with the idea of unifying Europe to achieve common goals. Further European integration by some states led to the formation of the European Union (EU), a separate political entity that lies between a confederation and a federation. The EU originated in Western Europe but has been expanding eastward since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. The currency of most countries of the European Union, the euro, is the most commonly used among Europeans; and the EU's Schengen Area abolishes border and immigration controls between most of its member states.","debatepedia",NA
"2.30","European Union","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:European_Union","The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of 27 member states that are located primarily in Europe. Its members have a combined area of 4,233,255.3 km2 (1,634,469.0 sq mi) and an estimated total population of about 447 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states in those matters, and only those matters, where members have agreed to act as one. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries and regional development. For travel within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999, coming into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.\nThe EU and European citizenship were established when the Maastricht Treaty came into force in 1993. The EU traces its origins to the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the European Economic Community (EEC), established, respectively, by the 1951 Treaty of Paris and 1957 Treaty of Rome. The original members of what came to be known as the European Communities were the Inner Six: Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany. The Communities and their successors have grown in size by the accession of new member states and in power by the addition of policy areas to their remit. The latest major amendment to the constitutional basis of the EU, the Treaty of Lisbon, came into force in 2009. \nIn January 2020, the United Kingdom became the first member state ever to leave the EU. Following a 2016 referendum, the UK signified its intention to leave and negotiated a withdrawal agreement.  \nThe UK is in a transitional phase until at least 31 December 2020, during which it remains subject to EU law and part of the EU single market and customs union. Before this, only three territories of member states had left the EU or its forerunners, these being French Algeria (in 1962, upon independence), Greenland (in 1985, following a referendum) and Saint Barth\u00e9lemy (in 2012).\nContaining in 2020 some 5.8% of the world population, the EU in 2017 (including the United Kingdom) had generated a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) of around 20 trillion US dollars, constituting approximately 25% of global nominal GDP. Additionally, all EU countries have a very high Human Development Index, according to the United Nations Development Programme. In 2012, the EU was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Through the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the EU has developed a role in external relations and defence. The union maintains permanent diplomatic missions throughout the world and represents itself at the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the G7 and the G20. Due to its global influence, the European Union has been described as an emerging superpower.","debatepedia",NA
"2.31","Family","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Family","In the context of human society, a family (from Latin: familia) is a group of people related either by consanguinity (by recognized birth) or affinity (by marriage or other relationship). The purpose of families is to maintain the well-being of its members and of society. Ideally, families would offer predictability, structure, and safety as members mature and participate in the community. In most societies, it is within families that children acquire socialization for life outside the family. Additionally, as the basic unit for meeting the basic needs of its members, it provides a sense of boundaries for performing tasks in a safe environment, ideally builds a person into a functional adult, transmits culture, and ensures continuity of humankind with precedents of knowledge.\nAnthropologists generally classify most family organizations as matrifocal (a mother and her children); patrifocal (a father and his children); conjugal (a wife, her husband, and children, also called the nuclear family); avuncular (for example, a grandparent, a brother, his sister, and her children); or extended (parents and children co-reside with other members of one parent's family).\nMembers of the immediate family may include spouses, parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters, sons, and daughters.Members of the extended family may include aunts, uncles, cousins, nephews, nieces, and siblings-in-law. Sometimes these are also considered members of the immediate family, depending on an individual's specific relationship with them, and the legal definition of ""immediate family"" varies. Sexual relations with family members are regulated by rules concerning incest such as the incest taboo.\nThe field of genealogy aims to trace family lineages through history. The family is also an important economic unit studied in family economics. The word ""families"" can be used metaphorically to create more inclusive categories such as community, nationhood, global village, and humanism.\n\n","debatepedia",NA

Its arrival is considered inevitable due to the existence of time and the laws of physics.  Due to the apparent nature of reality and the unavoidability of the future, everything that currently exists and will exist can be categorized as either permanent, meaning that it will exist forever, or temporary, meaning that it will end. In the Occidental view, which uses a linear conception of time, the future is the portion of the projected timeline that is anticipated to occur. In special relativity, the future is considered absolute future, or the future light cone.In the philosophy of time, presentism is the belief that only the present exists and the future and the past are unreal. Religions consider the future when they address issues such as karma, life after death, and eschatologies that study what the end of time and the end of the world will be. Religious figures such as prophets and diviners have claimed to see into the future. \nFuture studies, or futurology, is the science, art, and practice of postulating possible futures. Modern practitioners stress the importance of alternative and plural futures, rather than one monolithic future, and the limitations of prediction and probability, versus the creation of possible and preferable futures.\nThe concept of the future has been explored extensively in cultural production, including art movements and genres devoted entirely to its elucidation, such as the 20th-century movement futurism.","debatepedia",NA
"2.33","Gender","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Gender","Gender is the range of characteristics pertaining to, and differentiating between, masculinity and femininity. Depending on the context, these characteristics may include biological sex (i.e., the state of being male, female, or an intersex variation), sex-based social structures (i.e., gender roles), or gender identity. Most cultures use a gender binary, having two genders (boys/men and girls/women); those who exist outside these groups fall under the umbrella term non-binary or genderqueer. Some societies have specific genders besides ""man"" and ""woman"", such as the hijras of South Asia; these are often referred to as third genders (and fourth genders, etc.).\nSexologist John Money introduced the terminological distinction between biological sex and gender as a role in 1955. Before his work, it was uncommon to use the word gender to refer to anything but grammatical categories. However, Money's meaning of the word did not become widespread until the 1970s, when feminist theory embraced the concept of a distinction between biological sex and the social construct of gender. Today, the distinction is followed in some contexts, especially the social sciences and documents written by the World Health Organization (WHO).In other contexts, including some areas of the social sciences, gender includes sex or replaces it. For instance, in non-human animal research, gender is commonly used to refer to the biological sex of the animals. This change in the meaning of gender can be traced to the 1980s. In 1993, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) started to use gender instead of sex. Later, in 2011, the FDA reversed its position and began using sex as the biological classification and gender as ""a person's self representation as male or female, or how that person is responded to by social institutions based on the individual's gender presentation.""The social sciences have a branch devoted to gender studies. Other sciences, such as sexology and neuroscience, are also interested in the subject. The social sciences sometimes approach gender as a social construct, and gender studies particularly do, while research in the natural sciences investigates whether biological differences in males and females influence the development of gender in humans; both inform debate about how far biological differences influence the formation of gender identity. In some English literature, there is also a trichotomy between biological sex, psychological gender, and social gender role. This framework first appeared in a feminist paper on transsexualism in 1978.","debatepedia",NA
"2.34","Globalization","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Globalization","Globalization or globalisation is the process of interaction and integration among people, companies, and governments worldwide. As a complex and multifaceted phenomenon, globalization is considered by some as a form of capitalist expansion which entails the integration of local and national economies into a global, unregulated market economy. Globalization has grown due to advances in transportation and communication technology. With the increased global interactions comes the growth of international trade, ideas, and culture. Globalization is primarily an economic process of interaction and integration that's associated with social and cultural aspects. However, conflicts and diplomacy are also large parts of the history of globalization, and modern globalization.\nEconomically, globalization involves goods, services, the economic resources of capital, technology, and data. Also, the expansions of global markets liberalize the economic activities of the exchange of goods and funds. Removal of cross-border trade barriers has made formation of global markets more feasible. The steam locomotive, steamship, jet engine, and container ships are some of the advances in the means of transport while the rise of the telegraph and its modern offspring, the Internet and mobile phones show development in telecommunications infrastructure. All of these improvements have been major factors in globalization and have generated further interdependence of economic and cultural activities around the globe.Though many scholars place the origins of globalization in modern times, others trace its history long before the European Age of Discovery and voyages to the New World, some even to the third millennium BC. Large-scale globalization began in the 1820s. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, the connectivity of the world's economies and cultures grew very quickly. The term globalization is recent, only establishing its current meaning in the 1970s.In 2000, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) identified four basic aspects of globalization: trade and transactions, capital and investment movements, migration and movement of people, and the dissemination of knowledge. Further, environmental challenges such as global warming, cross-boundary water, air pollution, and over-fishing of the ocean are linked with globalization. Globalizing processes affect and are affected by business and work organization, economics, socio-cultural resources, and the natural environment. Academic literature commonly subdivides globalization into three major areas: economic globalization, cultural globalization, and political globalization.\n\n","debatepedia",NA
"2.35","Guns","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Guns","A gun is a ranged weapon typically designed to pneumatically discharge solid projectiles  but can also be liquid (as in water guns/cannons and projected water disruptors) or even charged particles (as in a plasma gun) and may be free-flying (as with bullets and artillery shells) or tethered (as with Taser guns, spearguns and harpoon guns).\nThe means of projectile propulsion vary according to designs, but are traditionally effected by a high gas pressure contained within a shooting tube (gun barrel), produced either through the rapid combustion of propellants (as with firearms), or by mechanical compression (as with air guns).  The high-pressure gas is introduced behind the projectile, accelerating it down the length of the tube, imparting sufficient launch velocity to sustain its further travel towards the target once the propelling gas ceases acting upon it at the end of the tube.  Alternatively, acceleration via electromagnetic field generation may be employed, in which case the shooting tube may be substituted by guide rails (as in railguns) or wrapped with magnetic coils (as in coilguns).\nThe first devices identified as guns appeared in China from around CE 1000. By the 12th century, the technology was spreading through the rest of Asia, and into Europe by the 13th century.","debatepedia",NA

Events occurring before written records are considered prehistory. ""History"" is an umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of information about these events. Scholars who write about history are called historians.\nHistory also includes the academic discipline which uses a narrative to examine and analyse a sequence of past events, and objectively determine the patterns of cause and effect that determine them. Historians sometimes debate the nature of history and its usefulness by discussing the study of the discipline as an end in itself and as a way of providing ""perspective"" on the problems of the present.Stories common to a particular culture, but not supported by external sources (such as the tales surrounding King Arthur), are usually classified as cultural heritage or legends, because they do not show the ""disinterested investigation"" required of the discipline of history. Herodotus, a 5th-century BC Greek historian is often considered within the Western tradition to be the ""father of history"", or by some the ""father of lies"", and, along with his contemporary Thucydides, helped form the foundations for the modern study of human history. Their works continue to be read today, and the gap between the culture-focused Herodotus and the military-focused Thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in modern historical writing. In East Asia, a state chronicle, the Spring and Autumn Annals, was known to be compiled from as early as 722 BC although only 2nd-century BC texts have survived.\nAncient influences have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today. The modern study of history is wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific regions and the study of certain topical or thematical elements of historical investigation. Often history is taught as part of primary and secondary education, and the academic study of history is a major discipline in university studies.","debatepedia",NA
"2.36","HIV/AIDS","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:HIV/AIDS","Human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is a spectrum of conditions caused by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Following initial infection a person may not notice any symptoms, or may experience a brief period of influenza-like illness. Typically, this is followed by a prolonged period with no symptoms. If the infection progresses, it interferes more with the immune system, increasing the risk of developing common infections such as tuberculosis, as well as other opportunistic infections, and tumors which are otherwise rare in people who have normal immune function. These late symptoms of infection are referred to as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). This stage is often also associated with unintended weight loss.HIV is spread primarily by unprotected sex (including anal and oral sex), contaminated blood transfusions, hypodermic needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. Some bodily fluids, such as saliva, sweat and tears, do not transmit the virus. HIV is a member of the group of viruses known as retroviruses. Methods of prevention include safe sex, needle exchange programs, treating those who are infected, pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis, and male circumcision. Disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both the mother and child antiretroviral medication. There is no cure or vaccine; however, antiretroviral treatment can slow the course of the disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy. Treatment is recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made. Without treatment, the average survival time after infection is 11 years.In 2018 about 37.9 million people were living with HIV and it resulted in 770,000 deaths. An estimated 20.6 million of these live in eastern and southern Africa. Between the time that AIDS was identified (in the early 1980s) and 2018, the disease caused an estimated 32 million deaths worldwide. HIV/AIDS is considered a pandemic—a disease outbreak which is present over a large area and is actively spreading. HIV originated in west-central Africa during the late 19th or early 20th century. AIDS was first recognized by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 1981 and its cause—HIV infection—was identified in the early part of the decade.\nHIV/AIDS has had a large impact on society, both as an illness and as a source of discrimination. The disease also has large economic impacts. There are many misconceptions about HIV/AIDS, such as the belief that it can be transmitted by casual non-sexual contact. The disease has become subject to many controversies involving religion, including the Catholic Church's position not to support condom use as prevention. It has attracted international medical and political attention as well as large-scale funding since it was identified in the 1980s.","debatepedia",NA
"2.39","Human rights","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Human_rights","Human rights are moral principles or norms that describe certain standards of human behaviour and are regularly protected as natural and legal rights in municipal and international law. They are commonly understood as inalienable, fundamental rights ""to which a person is inherently entitled simply because she or he is a human being"" and which are ""inherent in all human beings"", regardless of their age, ethnic origin, location, language, religion, ethnicity, or any other status. They are applicable everywhere and at every time in the sense of being universal, and they are egalitarian in the sense of being the same for everyone. They are regarded as requiring empathy and the rule of law and imposing an obligation on persons to respect the human rights of others, and it is generally considered that they should not be taken away except as a result of due process based on specific circumstances; for example, human rights may include freedom from unlawful imprisonment, torture, and execution.The doctrine of human rights has been highly influential within international law and global and regional institutions. Actions by states and non-governmental organisations form a basis of public policy worldwide. The idea of human rights suggests that ""if the public discourse of peacetime global society can be said to have a common moral language, it is that of human rights"". The strong claims made by the doctrine of human rights continue to provoke considerable scepticism and debates about the content, nature and justifications of human rights to this day. The precise meaning of the term right is controversial and is the subject of continued philosophical debate; while there is consensus that human rights encompasses a wide variety of rights such as the right to a fair trial, protection against enslavement, prohibition of genocide, free speech or a right to education, there is disagreement about which of these particular rights should be included within the general framework of human rights; some thinkers suggest that human rights should be a minimum requirement to avoid the worst-case abuses, while others see it as a higher standard.Many of the basic ideas that animated the human rights movement developed in the aftermath of the Second World War and the events of the Holocaust, culminating in the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Paris by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948. Ancient peoples did not have the same modern-day conception of universal human rights. The true forerunner of human rights discourse was the concept of natural rights which appeared as part of the medieval natural law tradition that became prominent during the European Enlightenment with such philosophers as John Locke, Francis Hutcheson and Jean-Jacques Burlamaqui and which featured prominently in the political discourse of the American Revolution and the French Revolution. From this foundation, the modern human rights arguments emerged over the latter half of the 20th century, possibly as a reaction to slavery, torture, genocide and war crimes, as a realisation of inherent human vulnerability and as being a precondition for the possibility of a just society.","debatepedia",NA
"2.40","Immigration","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Immigration","Immigration is the international movement of people to a destination country of which they are not natives or where they do not possess citizenship in order to settle or reside there, especially as permanent residents or naturalized citizens, or to take up employment as a migrant worker or temporarily as a foreign worker.As for economic effects, research suggests that migration is beneficial both to the receiving and sending countries. Research, with few exceptions, finds that immigration on average has positive economic effects on the native population, but is mixed as to whether low-skilled immigration adversely affects low-skilled natives. Studies show that the elimination of barriers to migration would have profound effects on world GDP, with estimates of gains ranging between 67 and 147 percent. Development economists argue that reducing barriers to labor mobility between developing countries and developed countries would be one of the most efficient tools of poverty reduction.The academic literature provides mixed findings for the relationship between immigration and crime worldwide, but finds for the United States that immigration either has no impact on the crime rate or that it reduces the crime rate. Research shows that country of origin matters for speed and depth of immigrant assimilation, but that there is considerable assimilation overall for both first- and second-generation immigrants.Research has found extensive evidence of discrimination against foreign born and minority populations in criminal justice, business, the economy, housing, health care, media, and politics in the United States and Europe.","debatepedia",NA

"2.43","International law","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:International_law","International law, also known as public international law and law of nations, is the set of rules, norms, and standards generally  accepted in relations between nations. It establishes normative guidelines and a common conceptual framework to guide states across a broad range of domains, including war, diplomacy, trade, and human rights. International law thus provides a means for states to practice more stable, consistent, and organized international relations.The sources of international law include international custom (general state practice accepted as law), treaties, and general principles of law recognized by most national legal systems. International law may also be reflected in international comity, the practices and customs adopted by states to maintain good relations and mutual recognition, such as saluting the flag of a foreign ship or enforcing a foreign judgment.\nInternational law differs from state-based legal systems in that it is primarily\u2014though not exclusively\u2014applicable to countries, rather than to individuals, and operates largely through consent, since there is no universally accepted authority to enforce it upon sovereign states. Consequently, states may choose to not abide by international law, and even to break a treaty. However, such violations, particularly of customary international law and peremptory norms (jus cogens), can be met with coercive action, ranging from military intervention to diplomatic and economic pressure.\nThe relationship and interaction between a national legal system (municipal law) and international law is complex and variable. National law may become international law when treaties permit national jurisdiction to supranational tribunals such as the European Court of Human Rights or the International Criminal Court. Treaties such as the Geneva Conventions may require national law to conform to treaty provisions. National laws or constitutions may also provide for the implementation or integration of international legal obligations into domestic law.","debatepedia",NA

Depending on the academic institution, it is either a field of political science, an interdisciplinary academic field similar to global studies, or an entirely independent academic discipline in which students take a variety of internationally focused courses in social science and humanities disciplines. In all cases, the field studies relationships between political entities (polities) such as sovereign states, inter-governmental organizations (IGOs), international non-governmental organizations (INGOs), other non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and multinational corporations (MNCs), and the wider world-systems produced by this interaction. International relations is an academic and a public policy field, and so can be positive and normative, because it analyses and formulates the foreign policy of a given state.\nAs political activity, international relations dates from the time of the Greek historian Thucydides (c.\u2009460\u2013395 BC), and, in the early 20th century, became a discrete academic field (no. 5901 in the 4-digit UNESCO Nomenclature) within political science. In practice, international relations and international affairs forms a separate academic program or field from political science, and the courses taught therein are highly interdisciplinary.For example, international relations draws from the fields of politics, economics, international law, communication studies, history, demography, geography, sociology, anthropology, criminology and psychology. The scope of international relations encompasses issues such as globalization, diplomatic relations, state sovereignty, international security, ecological sustainability, nuclear proliferation, nationalism, economic development, global finance, terrorism, and human rights.","debatepedia",NA
"2.45","Internet","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Internet","The Internet (portmanteau of interconnected network) is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing.\nThe origins of the Internet date back to the development of packet switching and research commissioned by the United States Department of Defense in the 1960s to enable time-sharing of mainframe computers. The primary precursor network, the ARPANET, initially served as a backbone for interconnection of regional academic and military networks in the 1970s. The funding of the National Science Foundation Network as a new backbone in the 1980s, as well as private funding for other commercial extensions, led to worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies, and the merger of many networks. The linking of commercial networks and enterprises by the early 1990s marked the beginning of the transition to the modern Internet, and generated a sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional, personal, and mobile computers were connected to the network. Although the Internet was widely used by academia in the 1980s, commercialization incorporated its services and technologies into virtually every aspect of modern life.\nMost traditional communication media, including telephony, radio, television, paper mail and newspapers are reshaped, redefined, or even bypassed by the Internet, giving birth to new services such as email, Internet telephony, Internet television, online music, digital newspapers, and video streaming websites. Newspaper, book, and other print publishing are adapting to website technology, or are reshaped into blogging, web feeds and online news aggregators. The Internet has enabled and accelerated new forms of personal interactions through instant messaging, Internet forums, and social networking. Online shopping has grown exponentially both for major retailers and small businesses and entrepreneurs, as it enables firms to extend their ""brick and mortar"" presence to serve a larger market or even sell goods and services entirely online.  Business-to-business and financial services on the Internet affect supply chains across entire industries.\nThe Internet has no single centralized governance in either technological implementation or policies for access and usage; each constituent network sets its own policies. The overreaching definitions of the two principal name spaces in the Internet, the Internet Protocol address (IP address) space and the Domain Name System (DNS), are directed by a maintainer organization, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). The technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols is an activity of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise. In November 2006, the Internet was included on USA Today's list of New Seven Wonders.","debatepedia",NA

The capital, and largest city, is Baghdad. Iraq is home to diverse ethnic groups including Arabs, Kurds, Assyrians, Turkmen, Shabakis, Yazidis, Armenians, Mandeans, Circassians and Kawliya. Around 99% of the country's 38 million citizens are Muslims, with tiny minorities of Christians, Yarsans, Yezidis and Mandeans also present. The official languages of Iraq are Arabic and Kurdish.\nIraq has a coastline measuring 58 km (36 miles) on the northern Persian Gulf and encompasses the Mesopotamian Alluvial Plain, the northwestern end of the Zagros mountain range and the eastern part of the Syrian Desert. Two major rivers, the Tigris and Euphrates, run south through Iraq and into the Shatt al-Arab near the Persian Gulf. These rivers provide Iraq with significant amounts of fertile land.\nThe region between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, historically known as Mesopotamia, is often referred to as the cradle of civilisation. It was here that mankind first began to read, write, create laws and live in cities under an organised government\u2014notably Uruk, from which ""Iraq"" is derived. The area has been home to successive civilisations since the 6th millennium BC. Iraq was the centre of the Akkadian, Sumerian, Assyrian and Babylonian empires. It was also part of the Median, Achaemenid, Hellenistic, Parthian, Sassanid, Roman, Rashidun, Umayyad, Abbasid, Ayyubid, Seljuk, Mongol, Timurid, Safavid, Afsharid and Ottoman empires.The country today known as Iraq was a region of the Ottoman Empire until the partition of the Ottoman Empire in the 20th century. It was made up of three provinces, called vilayets in the Ottoman language: Mosul Vilayet, Baghdad Vilayet, and Basra Vilayet. In April 1920 the British Mandate of Mesopotamia was created under the authority of the League of Nations. A British-backed monarchy joining these vilayets into one Kingdom was established in 1921 under Faisal I of Iraq. The Hashemite Kingdom of Iraq gained independence from the UK in 1932. In 1958, the monarchy was overthrown and the Iraqi Republic created. Iraq was controlled by the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party from 1968 until 2003. After an invasion by the United States and its allies in 2003, Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath Party was removed from power, and multi-party parliamentary elections were held in 2005. The US presence in Iraq ended in 2011, but the Iraqi insurgency continued and intensified as fighters from the Syrian Civil War spilled into the country. Out of the insurgency came a highly destructive group calling itself ISIL, which took large parts of the north and west. It has since been largely defeated. Disputes over the sovereignty of Kurdistan Region continue. A referendum about the full sovereignty of Kurdistan Region was held on 25 September 2017. On 9 December 2017, then-Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared victory over ISIL after the group lost its territory in Iraq.Iraq is a federal parliamentary republic consisting of 19 governorates (provinces) and one autonomous region (Kurdistan Region). The country's official religion is Islam. Culturally, Iraq has a very rich heritage and celebrates the achievements of its past in both pre-Islamic as well as post-Islamic times and is known for its poets. Its painters and sculptors are among the best in the Arab world, some of them being world-class as well as producing fine handicrafts, including rugs and carpets.

It is the world's second-largest religion with over 1.8 billion followers or 24.1% of the world's population, commonly known as Muslims. Muslims make up a majority of the population in 49 countries. Islam teaches that God is merciful, all-powerful, and unique, and has guided mankind through prophets, revealed scriptures and natural signs. The primary scriptures of Islam are the Quran, believed to be the verbatim word of God, and the teachings and normative examples (called the sunnah, composed of accounts called hadith) of Muhammad (c. 570 \u2013 8 June 632 CE).Muslims believe that Islam is the complete and universal version of a primordial faith that was revealed many times before through prophets including Adam, Abraham, Moses and Jesus. Muslims consider the Quran in its Arabic to be the unaltered and final revelation of God. Like other Abrahamic religions, Islam also teaches a final judgment with the righteous rewarded in paradise and unrighteous punished in hell. Religious concepts and practices include the Five Pillars of Islam, which are obligatory acts of worship, and following Islamic law (sharia), which touches on virtually every aspect of life and society, from banking and welfare to women and the environment. The cities of Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem are home to the three holiest sites in Islam.Aside from the theological narrative, Islam is historically believed to have originated in the early 7th century CE in Mecca, and by the 8th century the Umayyad Caliphate extended from Iberia in the west to the Indus River in the east. The Islamic Golden Age refers to the period traditionally dated from the 8th century to the 13th century, during the Abbasid Caliphate, when much of the historically Muslim world was experiencing a scientific, economic and cultural flourishing. The expansion of the Muslim world involved various states and dynasties such as the Ottoman Empire, trade and conversion to Islam by missionary activities (dawah).Most Muslims are of one of two denominations; Sunni (75\u201390%) or Shia (10\u201320%). About 13% of Muslims live in Indonesia, the largest Muslim-majority country; 31% live in South Asia, the largest population of Muslims in the world; 20% in the Middle East\u2013North Africa region, where it is the dominant religion; and 15% in Sub-Saharan Africa. Muslims are the majority in Central Asia, and are also widespread in the Caucasus, and Southeast Asia. India is the country with the largest Muslim population outside Muslim-majority countries.

Various attempts have been made to resolve the conflict as part of the Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process, with only partial success, as at the end of 2019.\nThe origins to the conflict can be traced back to Jewish immigration and sectarian conflict in Mandatory Palestine between Jews and Arabs. It has been referred to as the world's ""most intractable conflict,"" with the ongoing Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip reaching 53 years.Despite a long-term peace process and the general reconciliation of Israel with Egypt and Jordan, Israelis and Palestinians have failed to reach a final peace agreement. The key issues are mutual recognition and security, borders, water rights, control of Jerusalem, Israeli settlements, Palestinian freedom of movement, and Palestinian right of return. The violence of the conflict, in a region rich in sites of historic, cultural and religious interest worldwide, has been the subject of numerous international conferences dealing with historic rights, security issues and human rights, and has been a factor hampering tourism in and general access to areas that are hotly contested. Many attempts have been made to broker a two-state solution, involving the creation of an independent Palestinian state alongside the State of Israel (after Israel's establishment in 1948). In 2007, the majority of both Israelis and Palestinians, according to a number of polls, preferred the two-state solution over any other solution as a means of resolving the conflict.Within Israeli and Palestinian society, the conflict generates a wide variety of views and opinions. This highlights the deep divisions which exist not only between Israelis and Palestinians, but also within each society. A hallmark of the conflict has been the level of violence witnessed for virtually its entire duration. Fighting has been conducted by regular armies, paramilitary groups, terror cells, and individuals. Casualties have not been restricted to the military, with a large number of fatalities in civilian population on both sides. There are prominent international actors involved in the conflict. A majority of Jews see the Palestinians' demand for an independent state as just, and thinks Israel can agree to the establishment of such a state. The majority of Palestinians and Israelis in the West Bank and Gaza Strip have expressed a preference for a two-state solution. Mutual distrust and significant disagreements are deep over basic issues, as is the reciprocal skepticism about the other side's commitment to upholding obligations in an eventual agreement.The two parties currently engaged in direct negotiation are the Israeli government, led by Benjamin Netanyahu, and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), headed by Mahmoud Abbas. The official negotiations are mediated by an international contingent known as the Quartet on the Middle East (the Quartet) represented by a special envoy, that consists of the United States, Russia, the European Union, and the United Nations. The Arab League is another important actor, which has proposed an alternative peace plan. Egypt, a founding member of the Arab League, has historically been a key participant. Jordan, having relinquished its claim to the West Bank in 1988 and holding a special role in the Muslim Holy shrines in Jerusalem, has also been a key participant.\nSince 2006, the Palestinian side has been fractured by conflict between two major factions: Fatah, the traditionally dominant party, and its later electoral challenger, Hamas, which also operates as a militant organization. After Hamas's electoral victory in 2006, the Quartet conditioned future foreign assistance to the Palestinian National Authority (PA) on the future government's commitment to non-violence, recognition of the State of Israel, and acceptance of previous agreements. Hamas rejected these demands, which resulted in the Quartet's suspension of its foreign assistance program, and the imposition of economic sanctions by the Israelis. A year later, following Hamas's seizure of the Gaza Strip in June 2007, the territory officially recognized as the PA was split between Fatah in the West Bank and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The division of governance between the parties had effectively resulted in the collapse of bipartisan governance of the PA. However, in 2014, a Palestinian Unity Government, composed of both Fatah and Hamas, was formed. The latest round of peace negotiations began in July 2013 and was suspended in 2014.","debatepedia",NA
"2.50","Languages","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Languages","A language is a structured system of communication. Language, in a broader sense, is the method of communication that involves the use of \u2013 particularly human \u2013 languages.The scientific study of language is called linguistics. Questions concerning the philosophy of language, such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated at least since Gorgias and Plato in ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky.\nEstimates of the number of human languages in the world vary between 5,000 and 7,000. However, any precise estimate depends on the arbitrary distinction (dichotomy) between languages and dialect. Natural languages are spoken or signed, but any language can be encoded into secondary media using auditory, visual, or tactile stimuli \u2013 for example, in writing, whistling, signing, or braille. This is because human language is modality-independent. Depending on philosophical perspectives regarding the definition of language and meaning, when used as a general concept, ""language"" may refer to the cognitive ability to learn and use systems of complex communication, or to describe the set of rules that makes up these systems, or the set of utterances that can be produced from those rules. All languages rely on the process of semiosis to relate signs to particular meanings. Oral, manual and tactile languages contain a phonological system that governs how symbols are used to form sequences known as words or morphemes, and a syntactic system that governs how words and morphemes are combined to form phrases and utterances.\nHuman language has the properties of productivity and displacement, and relies entirely on social convention and learning. Its complex structure affords a much wider range of expressions than any known system of animal communication. Language is thought to have originated when early hominins started gradually changing their primate communication systems, acquiring the ability to form a theory of other minds and a shared intentionality. This development is sometimes thought to have coincided with an increase in brain volume, and many linguists see the structures of language as having evolved to serve specific communicative and social functions. Language is processed in many different locations in the human brain, but especially in Broca's and Wernicke's areas. Humans acquire language through social interaction in early childhood, and children generally speak fluently by approximately three years old. The use of language is deeply entrenched in human culture. Therefore, in addition to its strictly communicative uses, language also has many social and cultural uses, such as signifying group identity, social stratification, as well as social grooming and entertainment.\nLanguages evolve and diversify over time, and the history of their evolution can be reconstructed by comparing modern languages to determine which traits their ancestral languages must have had in order for the later developmental stages to occur. A group of languages that descend from a common ancestor is known as a language family. The Indo-European family is the most widely spoken and includes languages as diverse as English, Russian and Hindi; the Sino-Tibetan family includes Mandarin and the other Chinese languages, Bodo and Tibetan; the Afro-Asiatic family includes Arabic, Somali, and Hebrew; the Bantu languages include Swahili, and Zulu, and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout Africa; and the Malayo-Polynesian languages include Indonesian, Malay, Tagalog, and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout the Pacific. The languages of the Dravidian family, spoken mostly in Southern India, include Tamil, Telugu and Kannada.  Academic consensus holds that between 50% and 90% of languages spoken at the beginning of the 21st century will probably have become extinct by the year 2100.","debatepedia",NA

Idea de un Congreso Federal de las Rep\u00fablicas), by the Chilean politician Francisco Bilbao. The term was used also by Napoleon III's French government in the 1860s as Am\u00e9rique latine to consider French-speaking territories in the Americas (French Canadians, French Louisiana, French Guiana, Haiti, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Saint Martin, Saint Barth\u00e9lemy), along with the larger group of countries where Spanish and Portuguese languages prevailed, including the Spanish-speaking portions of the United States (Southwestern United States and Florida) Today, areas of Canada (such as Quebec) and the United States (with the exception of Puerto Rico) where Spanish and French are predominant and are typically not included in definitions of Latin America even if technically speaking they are.Latin America consists of 20 countries and 14 dependent territories that cover an area that stretches from Saint Pierre and Miquelon to Tierra del Fuego and includes much of the Caribbean. It has an area of approximately 19,197,000 km2 (7,412,000 sq mi), almost 13% of the Earth's land surface area.

"2.52","Law","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Law","Law is commonly understood as a system of rules that are created and enforced through social or governmental institutions to regulate conduct, although its precise definition is a matter of longstanding debate. It has been variously described as a science and the art of justice.  State-enforced laws can be made by a collective legislature or by a single legislator, resulting in statutes, by the executive through decrees and regulations, or established by judges through precedent, normally in common law jurisdictions. Private individuals can create legally binding contracts, including arbitration agreements that may elect to accept alternative arbitration to the normal court process. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution, written or tacit, and the rights encoded therein. The law shapes politics, economics, history and society in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people.\nLegal systems vary between countries, with their differences analysed in comparative law. In civil law jurisdictions, a legislature or other central body codifies and consolidates the law. In common law systems, judges make binding case law through precedent, although on occasion case law may be overturned by a higher court or the legislature. Historically, religious law influenced secular matters, and is still used in some religious communities. Sharia law based on Islamic principles is used as the primary legal system in several countries, including Iran and Saudi Arabia.Law's scope can be divided into two domains. Public law concerns government and society, including constitutional law, administrative law, and criminal law. Private law deals with legal disputes between individuals and/or organisations in areas such as contracts, property, torts/delicts and commercial law. This distinction is stronger in civil law countries, particularly those with a separate system of administrative courts; by contrast, the public-private law divide is less pronounced in common law jurisdictions.Law provides a source of scholarly inquiry into legal history, philosophy, economic analysis and sociology. Law also raises important and complex issues concerning equality, fairness, and justice.","debatepedia",NA

"2.54","Medicine","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Medicine","Medicine is the science and practice of establishing the diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and prevention of disease. Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness. Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others.Medicine has been around for thousands of years, during most of which it was an art (an area of skill and knowledge) frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture. For example, a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing, or an ancient philosopher and physician would apply bloodletting according to the theories of humorism. In recent centuries, since the advent of modern science, most medicine has become a combination of art and science (both basic and applied, under the umbrella of medical science). While stitching technique for sutures is an art learned through practice, the knowledge of what happens at the cellular and molecular level in the tissues being stitched arises through science.\n\nPrescientific forms of medicine are now known as traditional medicine and folk medicine, though they do not fall within the modern definition of \u201cmedicine\u201d which is based in medical science. Traditional medicine and folk medicine remain commonly used with, or instead of, scientific medicine and are thus called alternative medicine (meaning \u201c[something] other than medicine\u201d, from Latin alter, \u201cother\u201d). For example, evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture is ""variable and inconsistent"" for any condition, but is generally safe when done by an appropriately trained practitioner. In contrast, alternative treatments outside the bounds not just of scientific medicine, but also outside the bounds of safety and efficacy are termed quackery.  Quackery can encompass an array of practices and practitioners, irrespective of whether they are prescientific (traditional medicine and folk medicine) or modern pseudo-scientific, including chiropractic which rejects modern scientific germ theory of disease (instead believing without evidence that human diseases are caused by invisible subluxation of the bones, predominantly of the spine and less so of other bones), with just over half of chiropractors also rejecting the science of immunization.","debatepedia",NA

The term has come into wider usage as a replacement of the term Near East (as opposed to the Far East) beginning in the early 20th century. The broader concept of the ""Greater Middle East"" (or Middle East and North Africa) also adds the Maghreb, Sudan, Djibouti, Somalia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and sometimes even Central Asia and Transcaucasia into the region. The term ""Middle East"" has led to some confusion over its changing definitions.\nMost Middle Eastern countries (13 out of 18) are part of the Arab world. The history of the Middle East dates back to ancient times, with the geopolitical importance of the region being recognized for millennia. Several major religions have their origins in the Middle East, including Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Arabs constitute the majority ethnic group in the region, followed by Turks, Persians, Kurds, Azeris, Copts, Jews, Assyrians, Iraqi Turkmen, and Greek Cypriots.\nThe Middle East generally has a hot, arid climate, with several major rivers providing irrigation to support agriculture in limited areas such as the Nile Delta in Egypt, the Tigris and Euphrates watersheds of Mesopotamia (Iraq, Kuwait, and eastern Syria), and most of what is known as the Fertile Crescent. The most populous countries in the region are Egypt, Iran, and Turkey, while Saudi Arabia is the largest Middle Eastern country by area. Most of the countries that border the Persian Gulf have vast reserves of crude oil, with monarchs of the Arabian Peninsula in particular benefiting economically from petroleum exports.","debatepedia",NA

Morality can be a body of standards or principles derived from a code of conduct from a particular philosophy, religion or culture, or it can derive from a standard that a person believes should be universal. Morality may also be specifically synonymous with ""goodness"" or ""rightness"".\nMoral philosophy includes meta-ethics, which studies abstract issues such as moral ontology and moral epistemology, and normative ethics, which studies more concrete systems of moral decision-making such as deontological ethics and consequentialism. An example of normative ethical philosophy is the Golden Rule, which states that: ""One should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself.""Immorality is the active opposition to morality (i.e. opposition to that which is good or right), while amorality is variously defined as an unawareness of, indifference toward, or disbelief in any particular set of moral standards or principles.","debatepedia",NA
"2.57","Nuclear weapons","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Nuclear_weapons","A nuclear weapon (also called an atom bomb, nuke, atomic bomb, nuclear warhead, A-bomb, or nuclear bomb) is an explosive device that derives its destructive force from nuclear reactions, either fission (fission bomb) or from a combination of fission and fusion reactions (thermonuclear bomb). Both bomb types release large quantities of energy from relatively small amounts of matter. The first test of a fission (""atomic"") bomb released an amount of energy approximately equal to 20,000 tons of TNT (84 TJ). The first thermonuclear (""hydrogen"") bomb test released energy approximately equal to 10 million tons of TNT (42 PJ). A thermonuclear weapon weighing little more than 2,400 pounds (1,100 kg) can release energy equal to more than 1.2 million tons of TNT (5.0 PJ). A nuclear device no larger than traditional bombs can devastate an entire city by blast, fire, and radiation. Since they are weapons of mass destruction, the proliferation of nuclear weapons is a focus of international relations policy.\nNuclear weapons have been used twice in war, both times by the United States against Japan near the end of World War II. On August 6, 1945, the U.S. Army Air Forces detonated a uranium gun-type fission bomb nicknamed ""Little Boy"" over the Japanese city of Hiroshima; three days later, on August 9, the U.S. Army Air Forces detonated a plutonium implosion-type fission bomb nicknamed ""Fat Man"" over the Japanese city of Nagasaki.  These bombings caused injuries that resulted in the deaths of approximately 200,000 civilians and military personnel. The ethics of these bombings and their role in Japan's surrender are subjects of debate.\nSince the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, nuclear weapons have been detonated over two thousand times for testing and demonstration. Only a few nations possess such weapons or are suspected of seeking them. The only countries known to have detonated nuclear weapons\u2014and acknowledge possessing them\u2014are (chronologically by date of first test) the United States, the Soviet Union (succeeded as a nuclear power by Russia), the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, and North Korea. Israel is believed to possess nuclear weapons, though, in a policy of deliberate ambiguity, it does not acknowledge having them. Germany, Italy, Turkey, Belgium and the Netherlands are nuclear weapons sharing states. South Africa is the only country to have independently developed and then renounced and dismantled its nuclear weapons.The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons aims to reduce the spread of nuclear weapons, but its effectiveness has been questioned, and political tensions remained high in the 1970s and 1980s.

Obama, a Democrat from Illinois, took office following a decisive victory over Republican John McCain in the 2008 presidential election. Four years later, in the 2012 election, he defeated Republican Mitt Romney to win re-election. He was the first African American president, the first multiracial president, the first non-white president, and the first president to have been born in Hawaii. Obama was succeeded by Republican Donald Trump, who won the 2016 presidential election.\nObama's first-term actions addressed the global financial crisis and included a major stimulus package, a partial extension of the Bush tax cuts, legislation to reform health care, a major financial regulation reform bill, and the end of a major US military presence in Iraq. Obama also appointed Supreme Court Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, the latter of whom became the first Hispanic American on the Supreme Court. Democrats controlled both houses of Congress until Republicans won a majority in the House of Representatives in the 2010 elections. Following the elections, Obama and Congressional Republicans engaged in a protracted stand-off over government spending levels and the debt ceiling. The Obama administration's policy against terrorism downplayed Bush's counterinsurgency model, expanding air strikes and making extensive use of special forces and encouraging greater reliance on host-government militaries. The Obama administration orchestrated the military operation that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden in 2011.\nIn his second term, Obama took steps to combat climate change, signing a major international climate agreement and an executive order to limit carbon emissions. Obama also presided over the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and other legislation passed in his first term, and he negotiated rapprochements with Iran and Cuba. The number of American soldiers in Afghanistan fell dramatically during Obama's second term, though U.S. soldiers remained in Afghanistan throughout Obama's presidency and continue to as of 2019. Republicans took control of the Senate after the 2014 elections, and Obama continued to grapple with Congressional Republicans over government spending, immigration, judicial nominations, and other issues.","debatepedia",NA

Governments and society may also have a role in child-rearing. In many cases, orphaned or abandoned children receive parental care from non-parent or non-blood relations. Others may be adopted, raised in foster care, or placed in an orphanage. Parenting skills vary, and a parent or surrogate with good parenting skills may be referred to as a good parent.Parenting styles vary by historical time period, race/ethnicity, social class, and other social features.

Such questions are often posed as problems to be studied or resolved. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 \u2013 495 BCE). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument, and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? Philosophers also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will?Historically, ""philosophy"" encompassed any body of knowledge. From the time of Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle to the 19th century, ""natural philosophy"" encompassed astronomy, medicine, and physics. For example, Newton's 1687 Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy later became classified as a book of physics. In the 19th century, the growth of modern research universities led academic philosophy and other disciplines to professionalize and specialize. In the modern era, some investigations that were traditionally part of philosophy became separate academic disciplines, including psychology, sociology, linguistics, and economics.\nOther investigations closely related to art, science, politics, or other pursuits remained part of philosophy. For example, is beauty objective or subjective? Are there many scientific methods or just one? Is political utopia a hopeful dream or hopeless fantasy? Major sub-fields of academic philosophy include metaphysics (""concerned with the fundamental nature of reality and being""), epistemology (about the ""nature and grounds of knowledge [and]...its limits and validity""), ethics, aesthetics, political philosophy, logic and philosophy of science.","debatepedia",NA

The academic study focusing on just politics, which is therefore more targeted than general political science, is sometimes referred to as politology (not to be confused with politicology, a synonym for political science).In modern nation-states, people often form political parties to represent their ideas. Members of a party often agree to take the same position on many issues and agree to support the same changes to law and the same leaders.An election is usually a competition between different parties. Some examples of political parties worldwide are: the African National Congress (ANC) in South Africa, the Democratic Party (D) in the United States, the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in Germany and the Indian National Congress in India which has the highest number of political parties in the world (2546 political parties) .\nPolitics is a multifaceted word. It has a set of fairly specific meanings that are descriptive and nonjudgmental (such as ""the art or science of government"" and ""political principles""), but does often colloquially carry a negative connotation. The word has been used negatively for many years: the British national anthem as published in 1745 calls on God to ""Confound their politics"", and the phrase ""play politics"", for example, has been in use since at least 1853, when abolitionist Wendell Phillips declared: ""We do not play politics; anti-slavery is no half-jest with us.""A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.

Prisons are most commonly used within a criminal justice system: people charged with crimes may be imprisoned until their trial; those pleading or being found guilty of crimes at trial may be sentenced to a specified period of imprisonment. In simplest terms, a prison can also be described as a building in which people are legally held as a punishment for a crime they have committed.\nPrisons can also be used as a tool of political repression by authoritarian regimes. Their perceived opponents may be imprisoned for political crimes, often without trial or other legal due process; this use is illegal under most forms of international law governing fair administration of justice. In times of war, prisoners of war or detainees may be detained in military prisons or prisoner of war camps, and large groups of civilians might be imprisoned in internment camps.\nIn American English, the terms prison and jail have separate definitions, though this is not always followed in casual speech. A prison or penitentiary holds people for longer periods of time, such as many years, and is operated by a state or federal government. A jail holds people for shorter periods of time (e.g. for shorter sentences or pre-trial detention) and is usually operated by a local government. Outside of North America, prison and jail have the same meaning.\nSlang terms for a prison include: ""the pokey"", ""the slammer"", ""the cage"", ""the can"", ""the clink"", ""the joint"", ""the calaboose"", ""the hoosegow"", ""crowbar hotel"" and ""the big house"".

Generally organizations are involved in the prevention of and protection from events that could endanger the safety of the general public from significant danger, injury, or property damage, such as crimes or  disasters (natural or human-made).\n\n","debatepedia",NA
"2.66","Punishment","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Punishment","Punishment is the imposition of an undesirable or unpleasant outcome upon a group or individual, meted out by an authority\u2014in contexts ranging from child discipline to criminal law\u2014as a response and deterrent to a particular action or behavior that is deemed undesirable or unacceptable. The reasoning may be to condition a child to avoid self-endangerment, to impose social conformity (in particular, in the contexts of compulsory education or military discipline), to defend norms, to protect against future harms (in particular, those from violent crime), and to maintain the law\u2014and respect for rule of law\u2014under which the social group is governed.  Punishment may be self-inflicted as with self-flagellation and mortification of the flesh in the religious setting, but is most often a form of social coercion.\nThe unpleasant imposition may include a fine, penalty, or confinement, or be the removal or denial of something pleasant or desirable.  The individual may be a person, or even an animal. The authority may be either a group or a single person, and punishment may be carried out formally under a system of law or informally in other kinds of social settings such as within a family. Negative consequences that are not authorized or that are administered without a breach of rules are not considered to be punishment as defined here. The study and practice of the punishment of crimes, particularly as it applies to imprisonment, is called penology, or, often in modern texts, corrections; in this context, the punishment process is euphemistically called ""correctional process"". Research into punishment often includes similar research into prevention.\nJustifications for punishment include retribution, deterrence, rehabilitation, and incapacitation. The last could include such measures as isolation, in order to prevent the wrongdoer's having contact with potential victims, or the removal of a hand in order to make theft more difficult. Of the four justifications, only retribution is part of the definition of punishment and none of the other justifications is a guaranteed outcome, aside from obvious exceptions such as an executed man being incapacitated with regard to further crimes.If only some of the conditions included in the definition of punishment are present, descriptions other than ""punishment"" may be considered more accurate. Inflicting something negative, or unpleasant, on a person or animal, without authority is considered revenge or spite rather than punishment. In addition, the word ""punishment"" is used as a metaphor, as when a boxer experiences ""punishment"" during a fight. In other situations, breaking a rule may be rewarded, and so receiving such a reward naturally does not constitute punishment. Finally the condition of breaking (or breaching) the rules must be satisfied for consequences to be considered punishment.Punishments differ in their degree of severity, and may include sanctions such as reprimands, deprivations of privileges or liberty, fines, incarcerations, ostracism, the infliction of pain, amputation and the death penalty.\nCorporal punishment refers to punishments in which physical pain is intended to be inflicted upon the transgressor.\nPunishments may be judged as fair or unfair in terms of their degree of reciprocity and proportionality to the offense.\nPunishment can be an integral part of socialization, and punishing unwanted behavior is often part of a system of pedagogy or behavioral modification which also includes rewards.","debatepedia",NA
"2.67","Race","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Race","A race is a grouping of humans based on shared physical or social qualities into categories generally viewed as distinct by society. The term was first used to refer to speakers of a common language and then to denote national affiliations. By the 17th century the term began to refer to physical (phenotypical) traits. Modern scholarship regards race as a social construct, an identity which is assigned based on rules made by society. While partially based on physical similarities within groups, race does not have an inherent physical or biological meaning.Social conceptions and groupings of races vary over time, involving folk taxonomies that define essential types of individuals based on perceived traits. Scientists consider biological essentialism obsolete, and generally discourage racial explanations for collective differentiation in both physical and behavioral traits.Even though there is a broad scientific agreement that essentialist and typological conceptualizations of race are untenable, scientists around the world continue to conceptualize race in widely differing ways, some of which have essentialist implications. While some researchers use the concept of race to make distinctions among fuzzy sets of traits or observable differences in behaviour, others in the scientific community suggest that the idea of race often is used in a naive or simplistic way, and argue that, among humans, race has no taxonomic significance by pointing out that all living humans belong to the same species, Homo sapiens, and (as far as applicable) subspecies, Homo sapiens sapiens.Since the second half of the 20th century, the association of race with the ideologies and theories of scientific racism has led to the use of the word race itself becoming problematic. Although still used in general contexts, race has often been replaced by less ambiguous and loaded terms: populations, people(s), ethnic groups, or communities, depending on context.","debatepedia",NA
"2.68","Religion","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Religion","Religion is a social-cultural system of designated behaviors and practices, morals, worldviews, texts, sanctified places, prophecies, ethics, or organizations, that relates humanity to supernatural, transcendental, or spiritual elements. However, there is no scholarly consensus over what precisely constitutes a religion.Different religions may or may not contain various elements ranging from the divine, sacred things, faith, a supernatural being or supernatural beings or ""some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life"". Religious practices may include rituals, sermons, commemoration or veneration (of deities), sacrifices, festivals, feasts, trances, initiations, funerary services, matrimonial services, meditation, prayer, music, art, dance, public service, or other aspects of human culture. Religions have sacred histories and narratives, which may be preserved in sacred scriptures, and symbols and holy places, that aim mostly to give a meaning to life. Religions may contain symbolic stories, which are sometimes said by followers to be true, that have the side purpose of explaining the origin of life, the universe, and other things. Traditionally, faith, in addition to reason, has been considered a source of religious beliefs.There are an estimated 10,000 distinct religions worldwide. About 84% of the world's population is affiliated with either Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, or some form of folk religion. The religiously unaffiliated demographic includes those who do not identify with any particular religion, atheists, and agnostics. While the religiously unaffiliated have grown globally, many of the religiously unaffiliated still have various religious beliefs.The study of religion encompasses a wide variety of academic disciplines, including theology, comparative religion and social scientific studies. Theories of religion offer various explanations for the origins and workings of religion, including the ontological foundations of religious being and belief.","debatepedia",NA
"2.69","Science","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Science","Science (from the Latin word scientia, meaning ""knowledge"") is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.The earliest roots of science can be traced to Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia in around 3500 to 3000 BCE. Their contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and medicine entered and shaped Greek natural philosophy of classical antiquity, whereby formal attempts were made to provide explanations of events in the physical world based on natural causes. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, knowledge of Greek conceptions of the world deteriorated in Western Europe during the early centuries (400 to 1000 CE) of the Middle Ages but was preserved in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age. The recovery and assimilation of Greek works and Islamic inquiries into Western Europe from the 10th to 13th century revived ""natural philosophy"", which was later transformed by the Scientific Revolution that began in the 16th century as new ideas and discoveries departed from previous Greek conceptions and traditions. The scientific method soon played a greater role in knowledge creation and it was not until the 19th century that many of the institutional and professional features of science began to take shape; along with the changing of ""natural philosophy"" to ""natural science.""Modern science is typically divided into three major branches that consist of the natural sciences (e.g., biology, chemistry, and physics), which study nature in the broadest sense; the social sciences (e.g., economics, psychology, and sociology), which study individuals and societies; and the formal sciences (e.g., logic, mathematics, and theoretical computer science), which study abstract concepts. There is disagreement, however, on whether the formal sciences actually constitute a science as they do not rely on empirical evidence. Disciplines that use existing scientific knowledge for practical purposes, such as engineering and medicine, are described as applied sciences.Science is based on research, which is commonly conducted in academic and research institutions as well as in government agencies and companies. The practical impact of scientific research has led to the emergence of science policies that seek to influence the scientific enterprise by prioritizing the development of commercial products, armaments, health care, and environmental protection.\n\n","debatepedia",NA

Beneficiaries (technically referents) of security may be of persons and social groups, objects and institutions, ecosystems or any other entity or phenomenon vulnerable to unwanted change. \n\nSecurity mostly refers to protection from hostile forces, but it has a wide range of other senses: for example, as the absence of harm (e.g. freedom from want); as the presence of an essential good (e.g. food security); as resilience against potential damage or harm (e.g. secure foundations); as secrecy (e.g. a secure telephone line); as containment (e.g. a secure room or cell); and as a state of mind (e.g. emotional security).\nThe term is also used to refer to acts and systems whose purpose may be to provide security (e.g. security forces; security guard; cyber security systems; security cameras; remote guarding).","debatepedia",NA
"2.71","Sex","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Sex","Organisms of many species are specialized into male and female varieties, each known as a sex. Sexual reproduction involves the combining and mixing of genetic traits: specialized cells known as gametes combine to form offspring that inherit traits from each parent. The gametes produced by an organism define its sex: males produce small gametes (e.g. spermatozoa, or sperm, in animals) while females produce large gametes (ova, or egg cells). Individual organisms which produce both male and female gametes are termed hermaphroditic. Gametes can be identical in form and function (known as isogamy), but, in many cases, an asymmetry has evolved such that two different types of gametes (heterogametes) exist (known as anisogamy).\nPhysical differences are often associated with the different sexes of an organism; these sexual dimorphisms can reflect the different reproductive pressures the sexes experience. For instance, mate choice and sexual selection can accelerate the evolution of physical differences between the sexes.\nAmong humans and other mammals, males typically carry an X and a Y chromosome (XY), whereas females typically carry two X chromosomes (XX), which are a part of the XY sex-determination system. Humans may also be intersex. Other animals have various sex-determination systems, such as the ZW system in birds, the X0 system in insects, and various environmental systems, for example in reptiles and crustaceans. Fungi may also have more complex allelic mating systems, with sexes not accurately described as male, female, or hermaphroditic.","debatepedia",NA
"2.72","Smoking","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Smoking","Smoking is a practice in which a substance is burned and the resulting smoke breathed in to be tasted and absorbed into the bloodstream. Most commonly, the substance used is the dried leaves of the tobacco plant, which have been rolled into a small square of rice paper to create a small, round cylinder called a ""cigarette"". Smoking is primarily practiced as a route of administration for recreational drug use because the combustion of the dried plant leaves vaporizes and delivers active substances into the lungs where they are rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream and reach bodily tissue. In the case of cigarette smoking these substances are contained in a mixture of aerosol particles and gases and include the pharmacologically active alkaloid  nicotine; the vaporization creates heated aerosol and gas into a form that allows inhalation and deep penetration into the lungs where absorption into the bloodstream of the active substances occurs. In some cultures, smoking is also carried out as a part of various rituals, where participants use it to help induce trance-like states that, they believe, can lead them to spiritual enlightenment.\nSmoking generally has negative health effects, because smoke inhalation inherently poses challenges to various physiologic processes such as respiration. Diseases related to tobacco smoking have been shown to kill approximately half of long-term smokers when compared to average mortality rates faced by non-smokers. Smoking caused over five million deaths a year from 1990 to 2015.Smoking is one of the most common forms of recreational drug use. Tobacco smoking is the most popular form, being practiced by over one billion people globally, of whom the majority are in the developing countries. Less common drugs for smoking include cannabis and opium. Some of the substances are classified as hard narcotics, like heroin, but the use of these is very limited as they are usually not commercially available. Cigarettes are primarily industrially manufactured but also can be hand-rolled from loose tobacco and rolling paper. Other smoking implements include pipes, cigars, bidis, hookahs, and bongs.\nSmoking can be dated to as early as 5000 BCE, and has been recorded in many different cultures across the world. Early smoking evolved in association with religious ceremonies; as offerings to deities, in cleansing rituals or to allow shamans and priests to alter their minds for purposes of divination or spiritual enlightenment. After the European exploration and conquest of the Americas, the practice of smoking tobacco quickly spread to the rest of the world. In regions like India and Sub-Saharan Africa, it merged with existing practices of smoking (mostly of cannabis). In Europe, it introduced a new type of social activity and a form of drug intake which previously had been unknown.\nPerception surrounding smoking has varied over time and from one place to another: holy and sinful, sophisticated and vulgar, a panacea and deadly health hazard. In the 20th century, smoking came to be viewed in a decidedly negative light, especially in Western countries. This is due to smoking tobacco being among the leading causes of many diseases such as lung cancer, heart attack, COPD, erectile dysfunction, and birth defects. The health hazards of smoking have caused many countries to institute high taxes on tobacco products, run ads to discourage use, limit ads that promote use, and provide help with quitting for those who do smoke.","debatepedia",NA
"2.73","Society","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Society","A society is a group of individuals involved in persistent social interaction, or a large social group sharing the same spatial or social territory, typically subject to the same political authority and dominant cultural expectations. Societies are characterized by patterns of relationships (social relations) between individuals who share a distinctive culture and institutions; a given society may be described as the sum total of such relationships among its constituent of members. In the social sciences, a larger society often exhibits stratification or dominance patterns in subgroups.\nSocieties construct patterns of behavior by deeming certain actions or speech as acceptable or unacceptable. These patterns of behavior within a given society are known as societal norms. Societies, and their norms, undergo gradual and perpetual changes.\nInsofar as it is collaborative, a society can enable its members to benefit in ways that would otherwise be difficult on an individual basis; both individual and social (common) benefits can thus be distinguished, or in many cases found to overlap. A society can also consist of like-minded people governed by their own norms and values within a dominant, larger society. This is sometimes referred to as a subculture, a term used extensively within criminology.\nMore broadly, and especially within structuralist thought, a society may be illustrated as an economic, social, industrial or cultural infrastructure, made up of, yet distinct from, a varied collection of individuals. In this regard society can mean the objective relationships people have with the material world and with other people, rather than ""other people"" beyond the individual and their familiar social environment.","debatepedia",NA
"2.74","Sports","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Sports","Sport includes all forms of competitive physical activity or games which, through casual or organised participation, at least in part aim to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants, and in some cases, entertainment for spectators. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, simultaneously or consecutively, with one winner; in others, the contest (a match) is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports allow a ""tie"" or ""draw"", in which there is no single winner; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner and one loser. A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs.\nSport is generally recognised as system of activities which are based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with the largest major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition, and other organisations such as the Council of Europe using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports. However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports. The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge as bona fide sports, and SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: bridge, chess, draughts (checkers), Go and xiangqi, and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports.Sport is usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first. It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.\nRecords of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in sport news. Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues, and reaching wider audiences through broadcasting. Sport betting is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport.\nAccording to A.T. Kearney, a consultancy, the global sporting industry is worth up to $620 billion as of 2013. The world's most accessible and practised sport is running, while association football is the most popular spectator sport.","debatepedia",NA

A failure to pay, along with evasion of or resistance to taxation, is punishable by law. Taxes consist of direct or indirect taxes and may be paid in money or as its labour equivalent. The first known taxation took place in Ancient Egypt around 3000\u20132800 BC.\nMost countries have a tax system in place to pay for public, common or agreed national needs and government functions. Some levy a flat percentage rate of taxation on personal annual income, but most scale taxes based on annual income amounts. Most countries charge a tax on an individual's income as well as on corporate income. Countries or subunits often also impose wealth taxes, inheritance taxes, estate taxes, gift taxes, property taxes, sales taxes, payroll taxes or tariffs.\nIn economic terms, taxation transfers wealth from households or businesses to the government. This has effects which can both increase and reduce economic growth and economic welfare. Consequently, taxation is a highly debated topic.","debatepedia",NA

Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of their workings. Systems (e.g. machines) applying technology by taking an input, changing it according to the system's use, and then producing an outcome are referred to as technology systems or technological systems.\nThe simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food, and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale.\nTechnology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of Earth's environment. Innovations have always influenced the values of a society and raised new questions in the ethics of technology. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, and the challenges of bioethics.\nPhilosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar reactionary movements criticize the pervasiveness of technology, arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition.","debatepedia",NA
"2.77","Terrorism","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Terrorism","Terrorism is, in the broadest sense, the use of intentional violence for political or religious purposes. It is used in this regard primarily to refer to violence during peacetime or in the context of war against non-combatants (mostly civilians and neutral military personnel). The terms ""terrorist"" and ""terrorism"" originated during the French Revolution of the late 18th century but gained mainstream popularity in the 1970s during the conflicts of Northern Ireland, the Basque Country and Palestine. The increased use of suicide attacks from the 1980s onwards was typified by the September 11 attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C. in 2001.\nThere are different definitions of terrorism. Terrorism is a charged term. It is often used with the connotation of something that is ""morally wrong"". Governments and non-state groups use the term to abuse or denounce opposing groups. Varied political organizations have been accused of using terrorism to achieve their objectives. These include right-wing and left-wing political organizations, nationalist groups, religious groups, revolutionaries and ruling governments. Legislation declaring terrorism a crime has been adopted in many states. When terrorism is perpetrated by nation states, it is not considered terrorism by the state conducting it, making legality a largely grey-area issue. There is no consensus as to whether or not terrorism should be regarded as a war crime.The Global Terrorism Database, maintained by the University of Maryland, College Park, has recorded more than 61,000 incidents of non-state terrorism, resulting in at least 140,000 deaths, between 2000 and 2014.\n\n","debatepedia",NA

The three-world model arose during the Cold War to define countries aligned with NATO (the First World), the Eastern Bloc (the Second World, although this term was less used), or neither (the Third World).

"2.79","Trade","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Trade","Trade involves the transfer of goods or services from one person or entity to another, often in exchange for money. Economists refer to a system or network that allows trade as a market.\nAn early form of trade, barter, saw the direct exchange of goods and services for other goods and services. Barter involves trading things without the use of money.  When either bartering party started to involve precious metals, these gained symbolic as well as practical importance. Modern traders generally negotiate through a medium of exchange, such as money. As a result, buying can be separated from selling, or earning. The  invention of money (and later of credit, paper money and  non-physical money) greatly simplified and promoted trade.  Trade between two traders is called bilateral trade, while trade involving more than two traders is called multilateral trade.\nIn one modern view, trade exists due to specialization and the division of labor, a predominant form of economic activity in which individuals and groups concentrate on a small aspect of production, but use their output in trades for other products and needs. Trade exists between regions because different regions may have a comparative advantage (perceived or real) in the production of some trade-able commodity\u2014including production of natural resources scarce or limited elsewhere. For example: different regions' sizes may encourage mass production. In such circumstances, trade at market prices between locations can benefit both locations.\nRetail trade consists of the sale of goods or merchandise from a very fixed location (such as a department store, boutique or kiosk), online or by mail, in small or individual lots for direct consumption or use by the purchaser. Wholesale trade is defined as traffic in goods that are sold as merchandise to retailers, or to industrial, commercial, institutional, or other professional business users, or to other wholesalers and related subordinated services.\nHistorically, openness to free trade substantially increased in some areas from 1815 to the outbreak of World War I in 1914. Trade openness increased again during the 1920s, but collapsed (in particular in Europe and North America) during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Trade openness increased substantially again from the 1950s onwards (albeit with a slowdown during the oil crisis of the 1970s). Economists and economic historians contend that current levels of trade openness are the highest they have ever been.","debatepedia",NA

It is the largest, most familiar, most internationally represented and most powerful intergovernmental organization in the world. The UN is headquartered on international territory in New York City; other main offices are in Geneva, Nairobi, Vienna and The Hague.\nThe UN was established after World War II with the aim of preventing future wars, succeeding the ineffective League of Nations. On 25 April 1945, 50 governments met in San Francisco for a conference and started drafting the UN Charter, which was adopted on 25 June 1945 and took effect on 24 October 1945, when the UN began operations. Pursuant to the Charter, the organization's objectives include maintaining international peace and security, protecting human rights, delivering humanitarian aid, promoting sustainable development, and upholding international law. At its founding, the UN had 51 member states; this number grew to 193 in 2011, representing the vast majority of the world's sovereign states.\nThe organization's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union and their respective allies. Its missions have consisted primarily of unarmed military observers and lightly armed troops with primarily monitoring, reporting and confidence-building roles. UN membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization beginning in the 1960s. Since then, 80 former colonies have gained independence, including 11 trust territories that had been monitored by the Trusteeship Council. By the 1970s, the UN's budget for economic and social development programmes far outstripped its spending on peacekeeping. After the end of the Cold War, the UN shifted and expanded its field operations, undertaking a wide variety of complex tasks.The UN has six principal organs: the General Assembly; the Security Council; the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC); the Trusteeship Council; the International Court of Justice; and the UN Secretariat. The UN System includes a multitude of specialized agencies, such as the World Bank Group, the World Health Organization, the World Food Programme, UNESCO, and UNICEF. Additionally, non-governmental organizations may be granted consultative status with ECOSOC and other agencies to participate in the UN's work. The UN's chief administrative officer is the Secretary-General, currently Portuguese politician and diplomat Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, since 1 January 2017. The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states.\nThe UN, its officers, and its agencies have won many Nobel Peace Prizes, though other evaluations of its effectiveness have been mixed. Some commentators believe the organization to be an important force for peace and human development, while others have called it ineffective, biased, or corrupt.","debatepedia",NA

At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km2), it is the world's third or fourth-largest country by total area and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe. Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico. With an estimated population of over 328 million, the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world. The capital is Washington, D.C., and the most populous city is New York City.\nPaleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago. European colonization began in the 16th century. The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast. Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783, leading to independence. The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century\u2014gradually acquiring new territories, displacing Native Americans, and admitting new states\u2014until by 1848 it spanned the continent.\nDuring the second half of the 19th century, the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States. The Spanish\u2013American War and World War I confirmed the country's status as a global military power.\nThe United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower. It was the first country to develop nuclear weapons and the only country to have used them in warfare. During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union competed in the Space Race, culminating with the 1969 Apollo 11 mission, the spaceflight that first landed humans on the Moon. The end of the Cold War and collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 left the United States as the world's sole superpower.The United States is a federal republic and a representative democracy. It is a founding member of the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, Organization of American States (OAS), NATO, and other international organizations. It is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.\nA highly developed country, the United States is the world's largest economy by nominal GDP, the second-largest by purchasing power parity, and accounts for approximately a quarter of global GDP. The United States is the world's largest importer and the second-largest exporter of goods, by value. Although its population is 4% of the world total, it holds 31% of the total wealth in the world, the largest share of global wealth concentrated in a single country. Despite income and wealth disparities, the United States continues to rank very high in measures of socioeconomic performance, including average wage, median income, median wealth, human development, per capita GDP, and worker productivity.

The Constitution, originally comprising seven articles, delineates the national frame of government. Its first three articles embody the doctrine of the separation of powers, whereby the federal government is divided into three branches: the legislative, consisting of the bicameral Congress (Article One); the executive, consisting of the president  (Article Two); and the judicial, consisting of the Supreme Court and other federal courts  (Article Three). Articles Four, Five and Six embody concepts of federalism, describing the rights and responsibilities of state governments, the states in relationship to the federal government, and the shared process of constitutional amendment. Article Seven establishes the procedure subsequently used by the thirteen States to ratify it. It is regarded as the oldest written and codified national constitution in force.Since the Constitution came into force in 1789, it has been amended 27 times, including one amendment that repealed a previous one, in order to meet the needs of a nation that has profoundly changed since the eighteenth century. In general, the first ten amendments, known collectively as the Bill of Rights, offer specific protections of individual liberty and justice and place restrictions on the powers of government. The majority of the seventeen later amendments expand individual civil rights protections. Others address issues related to federal authority or modify government processes and procedures. Amendments to the United States Constitution, unlike ones made to many constitutions worldwide, are appended to the document. All four pages of the original U.S. Constitution are written on parchment.According to the United States Senate: ""The Constitution's first three words\u2014We the People\u2014affirm that the government of the United States exists to serve its citizens. For over two centuries the Constitution has remained in force because its framers wisely separated and balanced governmental powers to safeguard the interests of majority rule and minority rights, of liberty and equality, and of the federal and state governments."" The first permanent constitution of its kind, adopted by the people's representatives for an expansive nation, it is interpreted, supplemented, and implemented by a large body of constitutional law, and has influenced the constitutions of other nations.","debatepedia",NA

"2.84","War","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:War","War is intense armed conflict between states, governments, societies, or paramilitary groups such as mercenaries, insurgents and militias. It is generally characterized by extreme violence, aggression, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces. Warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general. Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant suffering and casualties.\nThe scholarly study of war is sometimes called polemology ( POL-\u0259-MOL-\u0259-jee), from the Greek polemos, meaning ""war"", and -logy, meaning ""the study of"".\nWhile some scholars see war as a universal and ancestral aspect of human nature, others argue it is a result of specific socio-cultural, economic or ecological circumstances.","debatepedia",NA
"2.85","Weapons proliferation","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Weapons_proliferation","Nuclear proliferation is the spread of nuclear weapons, fissionable material, and weapons-applicable nuclear technology and information to nations not recognized as ""Nuclear Weapon States"" by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, commonly known as the Non-Proliferation Treaty or NPT. Proliferation has been opposed by many nations with and without nuclear weapons, as governments fear that more countries with nuclear weapons will increase the possibility of nuclear warfare (up to and including the so-called countervalue targeting of civilians with nuclear weapons), de-stabilize international or regional relations, or infringe upon the national sovereignty of states.\nFour countries besides the five recognized Nuclear Weapons States have acquired, or are presumed to have acquired, nuclear weapons: India, Pakistan, North Korea, and Israel. None of these four is a party to the NPT, although North Korea acceded to the NPT in 1985, then withdrew in 2003 and conducted announced nuclear tests in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016, and 2017. One critique of the NPT is that the treaty is discriminatory in the sense that only those countries that tested nuclear weapons before 1968 are recognized as nuclear weapon states while all other states are treated as non-nuclear-weapon states who can only join the treaty if they forswear nuclear weapons.Research into the development of nuclear weapons was initially undertaken during World War II by the United States (in cooperation with the United Kingdom and Canada), Germany, Japan, and the USSR. The United States was the first and is the only country to have used a nuclear weapon in war, when it used two bombs against Japan in August 1945. After surrendering to end the war, Germany and Japan ceased to be involved in any nuclear weapon research. In August 1949, the USSR tested a nuclear weapon, becoming the second country to detonate a nuclear bomb. The United Kingdom first tested a nuclear weapon in October 1952. France first tested a nuclear weapon in 1960. The People's Republic of China detonated a nuclear weapon in 1964. India conducted its first nuclear test in 1974, which prompted Pakistan to develop its own nuclear program and, when India conducted a second series of nuclear tests in 1998, Pakistan followed with a series of tests of its own. In 2006, North Korea conducted its first nuclear test.","debatepedia",NA
"2.86","Welfare","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Welfare","Welfare is a type of government support for the citizens of that society.  Welfare may be provided to people of any income level, as with social security (and is then often called a social safety net), but it is usually intended to ensure that people can meet their basic human needs such as food and shelter. Welfare attempts to provide a minimal level of well-being, usually either a free- or a subsidized-supply of certain goods and social services, such as healthcare, education, and vocational training.A welfare state is a political system wherein the State assumes responsibility for the health, education, and welfare of society. The system of social security in a welfare state provides social services, such as universal medical care, unemployment insurance for workers, financial aid, free post-secondary education for students, subsidized public housing, and pensions (sickness, incapacity, old-age), etc. In 1952, with the Social Security (Minimum Standards) Convention (nr. 102), the International Labour Organization (ILO) formally defined the social contingencies covered by social security.\nThe first welfare state was Imperial Germany (1871\u20131918), where the Bismarck government introduced social security in 1889. In the early 20th century, the United Kingdom introduced social security around 1913, and adopted the welfare state with the National Insurance Act 1946, during the Attlee government (1945\u201351). In the countries of western Europe, Scandinavia, and Australasia, social welfare is mainly provided by the government out of the national tax revenues, and to a lesser extent by non-government organizations (NGOs), and charities (social and religious).","debatepedia",NA
"2.87","Wildlife","http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Category:Wildlife","Wildlife traditionally refers to undomesticated animal species, but has come to include all organisms that grow or live wild in an area without being introduced by humans. Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. Deserts, forests, rainforests, plains, grasslands, and other areas, including the most developed urban areas, all have distinct forms of wildlife. While the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched by human factors, most scientists agree that much wildlife is affected by human activities.Humans have historically tended to separate civilization from wildlife in a number of ways, including the legal, social, and moral senses. Some animals, however, have adapted to suburban environments. This includes such animals as domesticated cats, dogs, mice, and gerbils. Some religions declare certain animals to be sacred, and in modern times, concern for the natural environment has provoked activists to protest against the exploitation of wildlife for human benefit or entertainment.\nThe global wildlife population decreased by 52% between 1970 and 2014, according to a World Wildlife Fund report.\n\n","debatepedia",NA

It is also defined as ""the appearance, freshness, vigor, spirit, etc., characteristic of one who is young"". Its definitions of a specific age range varies, as youth is not defined chronologically as a stage that can be tied to specific age ranges; nor can its end point be linked to specific activities, such as taking unpaid work or having sexual relations.Youth is an experience that may shape an individual's level of dependency, which can be marked in various ways according to different cultural perspectives. Personal experience is marked by an individual's cultural norms or traditions, while a youth's level of dependency means the extent to which they still rely on their family emotionally and economically.","debatepedia",NA

"3.0","1919 World Series","","The 1919 World Series matched the American League champion Chicago White Sox against the National League champion Cincinnati Reds. Although most World Series have been of the best-of-seven format, the 1919 World Series was a best-of-nine series (along with 1903, 1920, and 1921). Baseball decided to try the best-of-nine format partly to increase popularity of the sport and partly to generate more revenue.The events of the series are often associated with the Black Sox Scandal, when several members of the Chicago franchise conspired with gamblers, allegedly led by Arnold Rothstein, to throw the World Series games. The 1919 World Series was the last World Series to take place without a Commissioner of Baseball in place. In 1920, the various franchise owners installed Kenesaw Mountain Landis as the first ""Commissioner of Baseball."" In August 1921, despite being acquitted from criminal charges, eight players from the White Sox were banned from organized baseball for fixing the series (or having knowledge about the fix).\n\n","wikipedia","5.11"
"3.1","1953 Iranian coup d'état","","The 1953 Iranian coup d'\u00e9tat, known in Iran as the 28 Mordad coup d'\u00e9tat (Persian: \u06a9\u0648\u062f\u062a\u0627\u06cc \u06f2\u06f8 \u0645\u0631\u062f\u0627\u062f\u200e), was the overthrow of the democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in favour of strengthening the monarchical rule of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi on 19 August 1953, orchestrated by the United States (under the name TPAJAX Project or ""Operation Ajax"") and the United Kingdom (under the name ""Operation Boot""). It was the first covert action of the United States to overthrow a foreign government during peacetime.Mosaddegh had sought to audit the documents of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC), a British corporation (now part of BP) and to limit the company's control over Iranian oil reserves. Upon the refusal of the AIOC to co-operate with the Iranian government, the parliament (Majlis) voted to nationalize Iran's oil industry and to expel foreign corporate representatives from the country. After this vote, Britain instigated a worldwide boycott of Iranian oil to pressure Iran economically. Initially, Britain mobilized its military to seize control of the British-built Abadan oil refinery, then the world's largest, but Prime Minister Clement Attlee opted instead to tighten the economic boycott while using Iranian agents to undermine Mosaddegh's government. Judging Mosaddegh to be unreliable and fearing a Communist takeover in Iran, UK prime minister Winston Churchill and the Eisenhower administration decided to overthrow Iran's government, though the preceding Truman administration had opposed a coup, fearing the precedent that Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) involvement would set. British intelligence officials' conclusions and the UK government's solicitations were instrumental in initiating and planning the coup, despite the fact that the U.S. government in 1952 had been considering unilateral action (without UK support) to assist the Mosaddegh government.Following the coup in 1953, a government under General Fazlollah Zahedi was formed which allowed Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran (Persian for an Iranian king), to rule more firmly as monarch. He relied heavily on United States support to hold on to power. According to the CIA's declassified documents and records, some of the most feared mobsters in Tehran were hired by the CIA to stage pro-Shah riots on 19 August. Other CIA-paid men were brought into Tehran in buses and trucks, and took over the streets of the city. Between 200 and 300 people were killed because of the conflict. Mosaddegh was arrested, tried and convicted of treason by the Shah's military court. On 21 December 1953, he was sentenced to three years in jail, then placed under house arrest for the remainder of his life. Other Mosaddegh supporters were imprisoned, and several received the death penalty. After the coup, the Shah continued his rule as monarch for the next 26 years until he was overthrown in the Iranian Revolution in 1979.In August 2013, sixty years afterward, the U.S. government formally acknowledged the U.S. role in the coup by releasing a bulk of previously classified government documents that show it was in charge of both the planning and the execution of the coup, including the bribing of Iranian politicians, security and army high-ranking officials, as well as pro-coup propaganda. The CIA is quoted acknowledging the coup was carried out ""under CIA direction"" and ""as an act of U.S. foreign policy, conceived and approved at the highest levels of government"".","wikipedia","5.6"

In Vietnam, the coup was referred to as C\u00e1ch m\u1ea1ng 1-11-63 (""1 November 1963 Revolution"").The Kennedy administration had been aware of the coup planning, but Cable 243 from the United States Department of State to U.S. Ambassador to South Vietnam Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., stated that it was U.S. policy not to try to stop it. Lucien Conein, the Central Intelligence Agency's liaison between the U.S. Embassy and the coup planners, told them that the U.S. would not intervene to stop it. Conein also provided funds to the coup leaders.The coup was led by General D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh and started on 1 November.

"3.3","1973 coup in Chile","","The 1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat was the overthrow of the socialist President of Chile Salvador Allende by the army and national police. It followed an extended period of social unrest and political tension between the opposition-controlled Congress of Chile and the socialist President Salvador Allende, as well as economic warfare ordered by US President Richard Nixon.The military deposed Allende's Popular Unity government and later established a junta that suspended all political activity in Chile and repressed left-wing movements, especially communist and socialist parties and the Revolutionary Left Movement (MIR). Allende's appointed army chief, Augusto Pinochet, rose to supreme power within a year of the coup and formally assumed power in late 1974. The Nixon administration, which had worked to create the conditions for the coup, promptly recognized the junta government and supported it in consolidating power.During the air raids and ground attacks that preceded the coup, Allende gave his final speech, vowing to stay in the presidential palace and refusing offers of safe passage should he choose exile over confrontation. Direct witness accounts of Allende's death agree that he killed himself in the palace.Before the coup, Chile had been hailed as a beacon of democracy and political stability for decades, a period in which the rest of South America had been plagued by military juntas and caudillismo. The collapse of Chilean democracy ended a succession of democratic governments in Chile, which had held democratic elections since 1932. Historian Peter Winn characterised the 1973 coup as one of the most violent events in the history of Chile. A weak insurgent movement against the Pinochet regime was maintained inside Chile by elements sympathetic to the former Allende government. An internationally supported plebiscite in 1988 held under the auspices of the military dictatorship was followed by a peaceful transition to an elected civilian government.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.4","1992 Los Angeles riots","","The 1992 Los Angeles riots were a series of riots and civil disturbances that occurred in Los Angeles County in April and May 1992. Unrest began in South Central Los Angeles on April 29, after a trial jury acquitted four officers of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) for usage of excessive force in the arrest and beating of Rodney King, which had been videotaped and widely viewed in TV broadcasts.\nThe rioting spread throughout the Los Angeles metropolitan area, as thousands of people rioted over a six-day period following the announcement of the verdict. Widespread looting, assault, arson, and murder occurred during the riots, in which local police could not put down due to lack of personnel and resources against the sheer number of rioters. The complete disorder in the Los Angeles area was resolved, after the California Army National Guard, the United States military, and several federal law enforcement agencies intervened to keep order and peace within L.A. County.\nWhen the riot ended, 63 people were killed, and 2,383 people were injured, with more than 12,000 arrests, and estimates of property damage were over $1 billion. LAPD Chief of Police Daryl Gates, who had already announced his resignation by the time of the riots, was attributed with much of the blame.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.5","2003 invasion of Iraq","","The 2003 invasion of Iraq was the first stage of the Iraq War. The invasion phase began on 19 March 2003 (air) and 20 March 2003 (ground) and lasted just over one month, including 26 days of major combat operations, in which a combined force of troops from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and Poland invaded Iraq. This early stage of the war formally ended on 1 May 2003 when U.S. President George W. Bush declared the ""End of major combat operations"", after which the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) was established as the first of several successive transitional governments leading up to the first Iraqi parliamentary election in January 2005. U.S. military forces later remained in Iraq until the withdrawal in 2011.The U.S.-led coalition sent 177,194 troops into Iraq during the initial invasion phase, which lasted from 19 March to 1 May 2003. About 130,000 arrived from the U.S. alone, with about 45,000 British soldiers, 2,000 Australian soldiers, and 194 Polish soldiers. 36 other countries were involved in its aftermath. In preparation for the invasion, 100,000 U.S. troops assembled in Kuwait by 18 February. The coalition forces also received support from the Peshmerga in Iraqi Kurdistan.\nAccording to U.S. President George W. Bush and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, the coalition aimed ""to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, to end Saddam Hussein's support for terrorism, and to free the Iraqi people."" Others place a much greater emphasis on the impact of the September 11 attacks, on the role this played in changing U.S. strategic calculations, and the rise of the freedom agenda. According to Blair, the trigger was Iraq's failure to take a ""final opportunity"" to disarm itself of alleged nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons that U.S. and British officials called an immediate and intolerable threat to world peace.In a January 2003 CBS poll, 64% of Americans had approved of military action against Iraq; however, 63% wanted Bush to find a diplomatic solution rather than go to war, and 62% believed the threat of terrorism directed against the U.S. would increase due to war. The invasion of Iraq was strongly opposed by some long-standing U.S. allies, including the governments of France, Canada, Germany, and New Zealand. Their leaders argued that there was no evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and that invading that country was not justified in the context of UNMOVIC's 12 February 2003 report. About 5,000 chemical warheads, shells or aviation bombs were discovered during the Iraq War, but these had been built and abandoned earlier in Saddam Hussein's rule before the 1991 Gulf War. The discoveries of these chemical weapons did not support the government's invasion rationale.On 15 February 2003, a month before the invasion, there were worldwide protests against the Iraq War, including a rally of three million people in Rome, which the Guinness Book of Records listed as the largest ever anti-war rally. According to the French academic Dominique Reyni\u00e9, between 3 January and 12 April 2003, 36 million people across the globe took part in almost 3,000 protests against the Iraq war.The invasion was preceded by an airstrike on the Presidential Palace in Baghdad on 20 March 2003. The following day, coalition forces launched an incursion into Basra Province from their massing point close to the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border. While special forces launched an amphibious assault from the Persian Gulf to secure Basra and the surrounding petroleum fields, the main invasion army moved into southern Iraq, occupying the region and engaging in the Battle of Nasiriyah on 23 March. Massive air strikes across the country and against Iraqi command-and-control threw the defending army into chaos and prevented an effective resistance. On 26 March, the 173rd Airborne Brigade was airdropped near the northern city of Kirkuk, where they joined forces with Kurdish rebels and fought several actions against the Iraqi Army to secure the northern part of the country.\nThe main body of coalition forces continued their drive into the heart of Iraq and met with little resistance. Most of the Iraqi military was quickly defeated and the coalition occupied Baghdad on 9 April. Other operations occurred against pockets of the Iraqi Army, including the capture and occupation of Kirkuk on 10 April, and the attack on and capture of Tikrit on 15 April. Iraqi president Saddam Hussein and the central leadership went into hiding as the coalition forces completed the occupation of the country. On 1 May President George W. Bush declared an end to major combat operations: this ended the invasion period and began the period of military occupation.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.6","2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami","","The 2011 earthquake off the Pacific coast of T\u014dhoku (\u6771\u5317\u5730\u65b9\u592a\u5e73\u6d0b\u6c96\u5730\u9707, T\u014dhoku-chih\u014d Taiheiy\u014d Oki Jishin) was a magnitude 9.0\u20139.1 (Mw) undersea megathrust earthquake off the coast of Japan that occurred at 14:46 JST (05:46 UTC) on Friday 11 March 2011, with the epicenter approximately 70 kilometers (43 mi) east of the Oshika Peninsula of T\u014dhoku and the hypocenter at an underwater depth of approximately 29 km (18 mi).\nThe earthquake is often referred to in Japan as the Great East Japan Earthquake (\u6771\u65e5\u672c\u5927\u9707\u707d, Higashi nihon daishinsai) and is also known as the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake, the Great Sendai Earthquake, the Great T\u014dhoku Earthquake, and the 3.11 earthquake.\nIt was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Japan, and the fourth most powerful earthquake in the world since modern record-keeping began in 1900.\nThe earthquake triggered powerful tsunami waves that may have reached heights of up to 40.5 meters (133 ft) in Miyako in T\u014dhoku's Iwate Prefecture, and which, in the Sendai area, traveled at 700 km/h (435 mph) for up to 10 km (6 mi) inland. Residents of Sendai had only eight to ten minutes of warning, and more than 19,000 were killed, many at evacuation sites, more than a hundred of which washed away.The earthquake moved Honshu (the main island of Japan) 2.4 m (8 ft) east, shifted the Earth on its axis by estimates of between 10 cm (4 in) and 25 cm (10 in), increased earth's rotational speed by 1.8 \u00b5s per day, and generated infrasound waves detected in perturbations of the low-orbiting GOCE satellite.\nInitially, the earthquake caused sinking of part of Honshu's Pacific coast by up to roughly a metre, but after about three years, the coast rose back and kept on rising to exceed its original height.The tsunami swept the Japanese mainland and killed over ten thousand people, mainly through drowning, though blunt trauma also caused many deaths. The latest report from the Japanese National Police Agency report confirms 15,899 deaths, 6,157 injured, and 2,529 people missing across twenty prefectures, and a report from 2015 indicated 228,863 people were still living away from their home in either temporary housing or due to permanent relocation.A report by the National Police Agency of Japan on 10 September 2018 listed 121,778 buildings as ""total collapsed"", with a further 280,926 buildings ""half collapsed"", and another 699,180 buildings ""partially damaged"". The earthquake and tsunami also caused extensive and severe structural damage in north-eastern Japan, including heavy damage to roads and railways as well as fires in many areas, and a dam collapse. Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan said, ""In the 65 years after the end of World War II, this is the toughest and the most difficult crisis for Japan."" Around 4.4 million households in northeastern Japan were left without electricity and 1.5 million without water.The tsunami caused nuclear accidents, primarily the level 7 meltdowns at three reactors in the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant complex, and the associated evacuation zones affecting hundreds of thousands of residents. Many electrical generators ran out of fuel. The loss of electrical power halted cooling systems, causing heat to build up. The heat build-up caused the generation of hydrogen gas. Without ventilation, gas accumulated within the reactor containment structures and eventually exploded. Residents within a 20 km (12 mi) radius of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant and a 10 km (6.2 mi) radius of the Fukushima Daini Nuclear Power Plant were evacuated.\nEarly estimates placed insured losses from the earthquake alone at US$14.5 to $34.6 billion. The Bank of Japan offered \u00a515 trillion (US$183 billion) to the banking system on 14 March in an effort to normalize market conditions. The World Bank's estimated economic cost was US$235 billion, making it the costliest natural disaster in history.","wikipedia","5.6"

"3.14","Abortion","","Abortion is the ending of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus before it can survive outside the uterus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or spontaneous abortion. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently ""induced miscarriage"". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. A similar procedure after the fetus has potential to survive outside the womb is known as a ""late termination of pregnancy"" or less accurately as a ""late term abortion"".When properly done, abortion is one of the safest procedures in medicine, but unsafe abortion is a major cause of maternal death, especially in the developing world. Making safe abortion legal and accessible reduces maternal deaths. It is safer than childbirth, which has a 14 times higher risk of death in the United States. Modern methods use medication or surgery for abortions. The drug mifepristone in combination with prostaglandin appears to be as safe and effective as surgery during the first and second trimester of pregnancy. The most common surgical technique involves dilating the cervix and using a suction device. Birth control, such as the pill or intrauterine devices, can be used immediately following abortion. When performed legally and safely on a woman who desires it, induced abortions do not increase the risk of long-term mental or physical problems. In contrast, unsafe abortions (those performed by unskilled individuals, with hazardous equipment, or in unsanitary facilities) cause 47,000 deaths and 5 million hospital admissions each year. The World Health Organization recommends safe and legal abortions be available to all women.Around 56 million abortions are performed each year in the world, with about 45% done unsafely. Abortion rates changed little between 2003 and 2008, before which they decreased for at least two decades as access to family planning and birth control increased. As of 2018, 37% of the world's women had access to legal abortions without limits as to reason. Countries that permit abortions have different limits on how late in pregnancy abortion is allowed.Historically, abortions have been attempted using herbal medicines, sharp tools, forceful massage, or through other traditional methods. Abortion laws and cultural or religious views of abortions are different around the world. In some areas abortion is legal only in specific cases such as rape, problems with the fetus, poverty, risk to a woman's health, or incest. There is debate over the moral, ethical, and legal issues of abortion. Those who oppose abortion often argue that an embryo or fetus is a human with a right to life, and they may compare abortion to murder. Those who support the legality of abortion often hold that it is part of a woman's right to make decisions about her own body. Others favor legal and accessible abortion as a public health measure.\n\n","wikipedia","['5.5','5.8']"
"3.11","ADD/ADHD","","Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a mental disorder of the neurodevelopmental type. It is characterized by difficulty paying attention, excessive activity and acting without regards to consequences, which are otherwise not appropriate for a person's age. Some individuals with ADHD also display difficulty regulating emotions. For a diagnosis, the symptoms should appear before a person is twelve years old, be present for more than six months, and cause problems in at least two settings (such as school, home, or recreational activities). In children, problems paying attention may result in poor school performance. Additionally there is an association with other mental disorders and substance misuse. Although it causes impairment, particularly in modern society, many people with ADHD can have sustained attention for tasks they find interesting or rewarding (known as hyperfocus).Despite being the most commonly studied and diagnosed mental disorder in children and adolescents, the exact cause is unknown in the majority of cases. Genetic factors are estimated to make up about 75% of the risk. Nicotine exposure during pregnancy may be an environmental risk. It does not appear to be related to the style of parenting or discipline. It affects about 5–7% of children when diagnosed via the DSM-IV criteria and 1–2% when diagnosed via the ICD-10 criteria. As of 2015, it was estimated to affect about 51.1 million people globally. Rates are similar between countries and depend mostly on how it is diagnosed. ADHD is diagnosed approximately two times more often in boys than in girls, although the disorder is often overlooked in girls because their symptoms differ from those of boys. About 30–50% of people diagnosed in childhood continue to have symptoms into adulthood and between 2–5% of adults have the condition. In adults inner restlessness rather than hyperactivity may occur. They often develop coping skills which make up for some or all of their impairments. The condition can be difficult to tell apart from other conditions, as well as to distinguish from high levels of activity that are still within the range of normative behaviors.ADHD management recommendations vary by country and usually involve some combination of counseling, lifestyle changes, and medications. The British guideline only recommends medications as a first-line treatment in children who have severe symptoms and for medication to be considered in those with moderate symptoms who either refuse or fail to improve with counseling, though for adults medications are a first-line treatment. Canadian and American guidelines recommend behavioral management first line in preschool-aged children while medications and behavioral therapy together is recommended after that. Treatment with stimulants is effective for at least 14 months; however, their long-term effectiveness is unclear and there are potentially serious side effects.The medical literature has described symptoms similar to those of ADHD since the 18th century. ADHD, its diagnosis, and its treatment have been considered controversial since the 1970s. The controversies have involved clinicians, teachers, policymakers, parents, and the media. Topics include ADHD's causes and the use of stimulant medications in its treatment. Most healthcare providers accept ADHD as a genuine disorder in children and adults, and the debate in the scientific community mainly centers on how it is diagnosed and treated. The condition was officially known as attention-deficit disorder (ADD) from 1980 to 1987, while before this it was known as hyperkinetic reaction of childhood.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.15","Adolf Hitler","","Adolf Hitler (German: [\u02c8ad\u0254lf \u02c8h\u026atl\u0250] (listen); 20 April 1889 \u2013 30 April 1945) was a German politician and leader of the Nazi Party (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei; NSDAP). He rose to power as the chancellor of Germany in 1933 and then as F\u00fchrer in 1934. During his dictatorship from 1933 to 1945, he initiated World War II in Europe by invading Poland on 1 September 1939. He was closely involved in military operations throughout the war and was central to the perpetration of the Holocaust. Hitler's actions and ideology are almost universally regarded as evil.\nHitler was born in Austria\u2014then part of Austria-Hungary\u2014and was raised near Linz. He moved to Germany in 1913 and was decorated during his service in the German Army in World War I. In 1919, he joined the German Workers' Party (DAP), the precursor of the NSDAP, and was appointed leader of the NSDAP in 1921. In 1923, he attempted to seize power in a failed coup in Munich and was imprisoned. In jail, he dictated the first volume of his autobiography and political manifesto Mein Kampf (""My Struggle""). After his release in 1924, Hitler gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles and promoting Pan-Germanism, anti-semitism and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda. He frequently denounced international capitalism and communism as part of a Jewish conspiracy.\nBy November 1932, the Nazi Party had the most seats in the German Reichstag but did not have a majority. As a result, no party was able to form a majority parliamentary coalition in support of a candidate for chancellor. Former chancellor Franz von Papen and other conservative leaders persuaded President Paul von Hindenburg to appoint Hitler as chancellor on 30 January 1933. Shortly after, the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act of 1933 which began the process of transforming the Weimar Republic into Nazi Germany, a one-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of National Socialism. Hitler aimed to eliminate Jews from Germany and establish a New Order to counter what he saw as the injustice of the post-World War I international order dominated by Britain and France. His first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the Great Depression, the abrogation of restrictions imposed on Germany after World War I, and the annexation of territories inhabited by millions of ethnic Germans, which gave him significant popular support.\nHitler sought Lebensraum (""living space"") for the German people in Eastern Europe, and his aggressive foreign policy is considered the primary cause of World War II in Europe. He directed large-scale rearmament and, on 1 September 1939, invaded Poland, resulting in Britain and France declaring war on Germany. In June 1941, Hitler ordered an invasion of the Soviet Union. By the end of 1941, German forces and the European Axis powers occupied most of Europe and North Africa. These gains were gradually reversed after 1941, and in 1945 the Allied armies defeated the German army. On 29 April 1945, he married his longtime lover Eva Braun. Less than two days later, the couple committed suicide to avoid capture by the Soviet Red Army. Their corpses were burned. \nUnder Hitler's leadership and racially motivated ideology, the Nazi regime was responsible for the genocide of at least 5.5 million Jews and millions of other victims whom he and his followers deemed Untermenschen (subhumans) or socially undesirable. Hitler and the Nazi regime were also responsible for the killing of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war. In addition, 28.7 million soldiers and civilians died as a result of military action in the European theatre. The number of civilians killed during World War II was unprecedented in warfare, and the casualties constitute the deadliest conflict in history.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.16","Adultery","","Adultery (from Latin adulterium) is extramarital sex that is considered objectionable on social, religious, moral, or legal grounds. Although the sexual activities that constitute adultery vary, as well as the social, religious, and legal consequences, the concept exists in many cultures and is similar in Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. A single act of sexual intercourse is generally sufficient to constitute adultery, and a more long-term sexual relationship is sometimes referred to as an affair.\nHistorically, many cultures considered adultery a very serious crime, some subject to severe punishment, usually for the woman and sometimes for the man, with penalties including capital punishment, mutilation, or torture. Such punishments have gradually fallen into disfavor, especially in Western countries from the 19th century. In countries where adultery is still a criminal offense, punishments range from fines to caning and even capital punishment. Since the 20th century, criminal laws against adultery have become controversial, with most Western countries decriminalising adultery.\nHowever, even in jurisdictions that have decriminalised adultery, it may still have legal consequences, particularly in jurisdictions with fault-based divorce laws, where adultery almost always constitutes a ground for divorce and may be a factor in property settlement, the custody of children, the denial of alimony, etc. Adultery is not a ground for divorce in jurisdictions which have adopted a no-fault divorce model.\nInternational organizations have called for the decriminalisation of adultery, especially in the light of several high-profile stoning cases that have occurred in some countries. The head of the United Nations expert body charged with identifying ways to eliminate laws that discriminate against women or are discriminatory to them in terms of implementation or impact, Kamala Chandrakirana, has stated that: ""Adultery must not be classified as a criminal offence at all"". A joint statement by the United Nations Working Group on discrimination against women in law and in practice states that: ""Adultery as a criminal offence violates women\u2019s human rights"".In Muslim countries that follow Sharia law for criminal justice, the punishment for adultery may be stoning. There are fifteen countries in which stoning is authorized as lawful punishment, though in recent times it has been legally carried out only in Iran and Somalia. Most countries that criminalize adultery are those where the dominant religion is Islam, and several Sub-Saharan African Christian-majority countries, but there are some notable exceptions to this rule, namely Philippines, Taiwan, and several U.S. states. In some jurisdictions, having sexual relations with the king's wife or the wife of his eldest son constitutes treason.\n\n","wikipedia","5.7"
"3.17","Adventism","","Adventism is a branch of Protestant Christianity that believes in the imminent Second Coming (or ""Second Advent"") of Jesus Christ. It originated in the 1830s in the United States during the Second Great Awakening when Baptist preacher William Miller first publicly shared his belief that the Second Coming would occur at some point between 1843 and 1844. His followers became known as Millerites. After the Great Disappointment, the Millerite movement split up and was continued by a number of groups that held different doctrines from one another. These groups, stemming from a common Millerite ancestor, became known collectively as the Adventist movement.\nAlthough the Adventist churches hold much in common, their theologies differ on whether the intermediate state of the dead is unconscious sleep or consciousness, whether the ultimate punishment of the wicked is annihilation or eternal torment, the nature of immortality, whether the wicked are resurrected after the millennium, and whether the sanctuary of Daniel 8 refers to the one in heaven or one on earth. The movement has encouraged the examination of the whole Bible, leading Seventh-day Adventists and some smaller Adventist groups to observe the Sabbath. The General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists has compiled that church's core beliefs in the 28 Fundamental Beliefs (1980 and 2005), which use Biblical references as justification.\nIn 2010, Adventism claimed some 22 million believers scattered in various independent churches. The largest church within the movement\u2014the Seventh-day Adventist Church\u2014had more than 19 million baptized members in 2015.\n\n","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.18","Affirmative action","","Affirmative action, which incorporates some of the features of both of the two distinct British terms ""positive discrimination"" and ""positive action"", describes policies that support members of a disadvantaged group that has previously suffered discrimination (and may continue to) in such areas as education, employment, or housing. Historically and internationally, support for affirmative action has sought to achieve goals such as bridging inequalities in employment and pay, increasing access to education, promoting diversity, and redressing apparent past wrongs, harms, or hindrances.\nThe nature of affirmative action policies varies from region to region and exists on a spectrum from a hard quota to merely targeting encouragement for increased participation. Some countries use a quota system, whereby a certain percentage of government jobs, political positions, and school vacancies must be reserved for members of a certain group; an example of this is the reservation system in India.\nIn some other regions where quotas are not used, minority group members are given preference or special consideration in selection processes. In the United States, affirmative action in employment and education has been the subject of legal and political controversy. In 2003, the Supreme Court of the United States, in Grutter v. Bollinger, held that the University of Michigan Law School could consider race as a plus-factor when evaluating applicants holistically and maintained the prohibition on the use of quotas.In the UK, hiring someone simply because of their protected group status, without regard to their performance, is illegal. However, the law in the UK does allow for membership in a protected and disadvantaged group to be considered in hiring and promotion in the event that that group is under-represented in a given area and if the candidates are of equal merit. The controlling logic is that the person must not be chosen simply because of their group membership, but rather that the relevant authorities are allowed to use disadvantaged group status as a ""tie-breaker"" between two candidates of otherwise equal merit. This is functionally the same as the practice known as ""affirmative action"" in the United States.\nAn alternative approach common in the UK is described as ""positive action"", however. Under this approach, the focus tends to be on ensuring equal opportunity and, for example, targeted advertising campaigns to encourage ethnic minority candidates to join the police force. This is often described as being ""color blind"", although the social viability of that concept is heavily contested.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.19","African National Congress","","The African National Congress (ANC) is the Republic of South Africa's governing political party. It has been the ruling party of post-apartheid South Africa since the election of Nelson Mandela in the 1994 election, winning every election since then. Cyril Ramaphosa, the incumbent President of South Africa, has served as leader of the ANC since 18 December 2017.Founded on 8 January 1912 by John Langalibalele Dube in Bloemfontein as the South African Native National Congress (SANNC), its primary mission was to bring all Africans together as one people, to defend their rights and freedoms. This included giving full voting rights to black South Africans and mixed-race South Africans and, from 1948 onwards, to end the system of apartheid introduced by the Nationalist Party government after their election (by White voters only) in that year.The ANC originally attempted to use non-violent protests to end apartheid; however, the Sharpeville massacre in March 1960, in which 69 black Africans were shot and killed by police and hundreds wounded during a peaceful protest, contributed to deteriorating relations with the South African government. On 8 April 1960, the administration of Charles Robberts Swart banned the ANC in South Africa. After the ban, the ANC formed the Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation) to fight against apartheid utilising guerrilla warfare and sabotage.\nAfter 30 years of exiled struggle, during which many ANC members had been imprisoned or forced abroad, the country began its move towards full democracy. On 3 February 1990, State President F. W. de Klerk lifted the ban on the ANC and released Nelson Mandela from prison on 11 February 1990. On 17 March 1992, the apartheid referendum was passed by the white only electorate, removing apartheid and allowing the ANC to run in the 1994 election, which for the first time allowed all South Africans to vote for their national government. Since the 1994 election the ANC has performed better than 55% in all general elections, including the most recent 2019 election. However the party has been embroiled in a number of controversies since 2011.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.20","Afrikaans","","Afrikaans (UK: , US: ) is a West Germanic language spoken in South Africa, Namibia and, to a lesser extent, Botswana and Zimbabwe. It evolved from the Dutch vernacular of Holland (Hollandic dialect) spoken by the largely Dutch settlers (and then by the native Africans who associated with them) in the south-west of what is now South Africa, where it gradually began to develop distinguishing characteristics in the course of the 18th century. Hence, it is a daughter language of Dutch.\nAlthough Afrikaans has adopted words from other languages, including German and the Khoisan languages, an estimated 90 to 95% of the vocabulary of Afrikaans is of Dutch origin. Therefore, differences with Dutch often lie in the more analytic-type morphology and grammar of Afrikaans, and a spelling that expresses Afrikaans pronunciation rather than standard Dutch. There is a large degree of mutual intelligibility between the two languages\u2014especially in written form.With about 7 million native speakers in South Africa, or 13.5% of the population, it is the third-most-spoken language in the country. Estimates of the total number of Afrikaans speakers range between 15 and 23 million. It has the widest geographical and racial distribution of all the 11 official languages of South Africa, and is widely spoken and understood as a second or third language. It is the majority language of the western half of South Africa\u2014the provinces of the Northern Cape and Western Cape\u2014and the first language of 75.8% of Coloured South Africans (4.8 million people), 60.8% of White South Africans (2.7 million); 4.6% of Asian South Africans (58,000 people), and 1.5% of Black South Africans (600,000 people).\n\n","wikipedia","5.10"
"3.21","Age of consent","","The age of consent is the age at which a person is considered to be legally competent to consent to sexual acts. Consequently, an adult who engages in sexual activity with a person younger than the age of consent cannot claim that the sexual activity was consensual, and such sexual activity may be considered child sexual abuse or statutory rape. The person below the minimum age is regarded as the victim and their sex partner is regarded as the offender, unless both are underage. The purpose of setting an age of consent is to protect an underage person from sexual advances.\nThe term age of consent rarely appears in legal statutes. Generally, a law will instead establish the age below which it is illegal to engage in sexual activity with that person. It has sometimes been used with other meanings, such as the age at which a person becomes competent to consent to marriage, but the meaning given above is the one now generally understood. It should not be confused with other laws regarding age minimums including, but not limited to, the age of majority, age of criminal responsibility, voting age, drinking age, and driving age.\nAge of consent laws vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, though most jurisdictions set the age of consent in the range 14 to 18. The laws may also vary by the type of sexual act, the gender of the participants or other considerations, such as involving a position of trust; some jurisdictions may also make allowances for minors engaged in sexual acts with each other, rather than a single age. Charges and penalties resulting from a breach of these laws may range from a misdemeanor, such as corruption of a minor, to what is popularly called statutory rape.\nThere are many ""grey areas"" in this area of law, some regarding unspecific and untried legislation, others brought about by debates regarding changing societal attitudes, and others due to conflicts between federal and state laws. These factors all make age of consent an often confusing subject, and a topic of highly charged debates.","wikipedia","5.7"
"3.22","Agnosticism","","Agnosticism is the view that the existence of God, of the divine or the supernatural is unknown or unknowable. Another definition provided is the view that ""human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that God exists or the belief that God does not exist.""The English biologist Thomas Henry Huxley coined the word agnostic in 1869, and said ""It simply means that a man shall not say he knows or believes that which he has no scientific grounds for professing to know or believe.""\nEarlier thinkers, however, had written works that promoted agnostic points of view, such as Sanjaya Belatthaputta, a 5th-century BCE Indian philosopher who expressed agnosticism about any afterlife; and Protagoras, a 5th-century BCE Greek philosopher who expressed agnosticism about the existence of ""the gods"".Agnosticism is the doctrine or tenet of agnostics with regard to the existence of anything beyond and behind material phenomena or to knowledge of a First Cause or God, and is not a religion.","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.12","AIDS","","Human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is a spectrum of conditions caused by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Following initial infection a person may not notice any symptoms, or may experience a brief period of influenza-like illness. Typically, this is followed by a prolonged period with no symptoms. If the infection progresses, it interferes more with the immune system, increasing the risk of developing common infections such as tuberculosis, as well as other opportunistic infections, and tumors which are otherwise rare in people who have normal immune function. These late symptoms of infection are referred to as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). This stage is often also associated with unintended weight loss.HIV is spread primarily by unprotected sex (including anal and oral sex), contaminated blood transfusions, hypodermic needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. Some bodily fluids, such as saliva, sweat and tears, do not transmit the virus. HIV is a member of the group of viruses known as retroviruses. Methods of prevention include safe sex, needle exchange programs, treating those who are infected, pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis, and male circumcision. Disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both the mother and child antiretroviral medication. There is no cure or vaccine; however, antiretroviral treatment can slow the course of the disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy. Treatment is recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made. Without treatment, the average survival time after infection is 11 years.In 2018 about 37.9 million people were living with HIV and it resulted in 770,000 deaths. An estimated 20.6 million of these live in eastern and southern Africa. Between the time that AIDS was identified (in the early 1980s) and 2018, the disease caused an estimated 32 million deaths worldwide. HIV/AIDS is considered a pandemic\u2014a disease outbreak which is present over a large area and is actively spreading. HIV originated in west-central Africa during the late 19th or early 20th century. AIDS was first recognized by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 1981 and its cause\u2014HIV infection\u2014was identified in the early part of the decade.\nHIV/AIDS has had a large impact on society, both as an illness and as a source of discrimination. The disease also has large economic impacts. There are many misconceptions about HIV/AIDS, such as the belief that it can be transmitted by casual non-sexual contact. The disease has become subject to many controversies involving religion, including the Catholic Church's position not to support condom use as prevention. It has attracted international medical and political attention as well as large-scale funding since it was identified in the 1980s.\n\n","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.13","AIDS denialism","","HIV/AIDS denialism is the belief, contradicted by conclusive evidence, that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) does not cause acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Some of its proponents reject the existence of HIV, while others accept that HIV exists but argue that it is a harmless passenger virus and not the cause of AIDS. Insofar as they acknowledge AIDS as a real disease, they attribute it to some combination of sexual behavior, recreational drugs, malnutrition, poor sanitation, haemophilia, or the effects of the medications used to treat HIV infection (antiretrovirals).The scientific consensus is that the evidence showing HIV to be the cause of AIDS is conclusive and that HIV/AIDS denialist claims are pseudoscience based on conspiracy theories, faulty reasoning, cherry picking, and misrepresentation of mainly outdated scientific data. With the rejection of these arguments by the scientific community, HIV/AIDS denialist material is now targeted at less scientifically sophisticated audiences and spread mainly through the Internet.Despite its lack of scientific acceptance, HIV/AIDS denialism has had a significant political impact, especially in South Africa under the presidency of Thabo Mbeki. Scientists and physicians have raised alarm at the human cost of HIV/AIDS denialism, which discourages HIV-positive people from using proven treatments. Public health researchers have attributed 330,000 to 340,000 AIDS-related deaths, along with 171,000 other HIV infections and 35,000 infant HIV infections, to the South African government's former embrace of HIV/AIDS denialism. The interrupted use of antiretroviral treatments is also a major global concern as it potentially increases the likelihood of the emergence of antiretroviral-resistant strains of the virus.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.24","Alberta","","Alberta is a province of Canada. With an estimated population of 4,067,175 as of 2016 census, it is Canada's fourth most populous province and the most populous of Canada's three prairie provinces. Its area is about 660,000 square kilometres (250,000 sq mi). Alberta and its neighbour Saskatchewan were districts of the Northwest Territories until they were established as provinces on September 1, 1905.Alberta is bordered by the provinces of British Columbia to the west and Saskatchewan to the east, the Northwest Territories to the north, and the U.S. state of Montana to the south. Alberta is one of three Canadian provinces and territories to border only a single U.S. state and one of only two landlocked provinces. It has a predominantly humid continental climate, with stark contrasts over a year; but seasonal temperature average swings are smaller than in areas further east, due to winters being warmed by occasional chinook winds bringing sudden warming.Alberta's capital, Edmonton, is near the geographic centre of the province and is the primary supply and service hub for Canada's crude oil, the Athabasca oil sands and other northern resource industries.About 290 km (180 mi) south of the capital is Calgary, the largest city in Alberta. Calgary and Edmonton centre Alberta's two census metropolitan areas, both of which have populations exceeding one million, while the province has 16 census agglomerations.Tourist destinations in the province include Banff, Canmore, Drumheller, Jasper, Sylvan Lake and Lake Louise. Alberta is home to six UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks, Dinosaur Provincial Park, the Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump, Waterton\u2013Glacier International Peace Park, Wood Buffalo National Park, and Writing-on-Stone / \u00c1\u00eds\u00ednai'pi.\n\n","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.23","Albert Einstein","","Albert Einstein ( EYEN-styne; German: [\u02c8alb\u025b\u0281t \u02c8\u0294a\u026an\u0283ta\u026an] (listen); 14 March 1879 \u2013 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He is best known to the general public for his mass\u2013energy equivalence formula \n  \n    \n      \n        E\n        =\n        m\n        \n          c\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle E=mc^{2}}\n  , which has been dubbed ""the world's most famous equation"". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics ""for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect"", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.\nNear the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that Newtonian mechanics was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field. This led him to develop his special theory of relativity during his time at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern (1902\u20131909). He subsequently realized that the principle of relativity could be extended to gravitational fields, and published a paper on general relativity in 1916 introducing his theory of gravitation. He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation, the basis of laser, which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light. In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe.Einstein moved to Switzerland in 1895 and renounced his German citizenship in 1896. After being stateless for more than five years, he acquired Swiss citizenship in 1901, which he kept for the rest of his life. Except for one year in Prague, he lived in Switzerland between 1895 and 1914.\nHe received his academic diploma from the Swiss federal polytechnic school (later the Eidgen\u00f6ssische Technische Hochschule, ETH) in Z\u00fcrich in 1900. Between 1902 and 1909 he was employed in Bern as a patent examiner at the Federal Office for Intellectual Property, the patent office. In 1905, called his annus mirabilis (miracle year), he published four groundbreaking papers, which attracted the attention of the academic world. That year, at the age of 26, he was awarded a Ph.D. by the University of Zurich.\nHe taught theoretical physics for one year (1908/09) at the University of Bern, for two years (1909\u201311) at the University of Zurich, and after one year at the Charles University in Prague he returned to his alma mater ETH Zurich between 1912 and 1914, before he left for Berlin, where he was elected to the Prussian Academy of Sciences.\nIn 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power. Because of his Jewish background, Einstein did not return to Germany. He settled in the United States and became an American citizen in 1940. On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting FDR to the potential development of ""extremely powerful bombs of a new type"" and recommending that the US begin similar research. This eventually led to the Manhattan Project. Einstein supported the Allies, but he generally denounced the idea of using nuclear fission as a weapon. He signed the Russell\u2013Einstein Manifesto with British philosopher Bertrand Russell, which highlighted the danger of nuclear weapons. He was affiliated with the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, until his death in 1955.\nHe published more than 300 scientific papers and more than 150 non-scientific works. His intellectual achievements and originality have made the word ""Einstein"" synonymous with ""genius"". Eugene Wigner compared him to his contemporaries, writing that ""Einstein's understanding was deeper even than Jancsi von Neumann's. His mind was both more penetrating and more original"".","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.25","Alcoholism","","Alcoholism, also known as alcohol use disorder (AUD), is a broad term for any drinking of alcohol that results in mental or physical health problems. The disorder was previously divided into two types: alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence. In a medical context, alcoholism is said to exist when two or more of the following conditions are present: a person drinks large amounts of alcohol over a long time period, has difficulty cutting down, acquiring and drinking alcohol takes up a great deal of time, alcohol is strongly desired, usage results in not fulfilling responsibilities, usage results in social problems, usage results in health problems, usage results in risky situations, withdrawal occurs when stopping, and alcohol tolerance has occurred with use. Alcohol use can affect all parts of the body, but it particularly affects the brain, heart, liver, pancreas and immune system. Alcoholism can result in mental illness, Wernicke\u2013Korsakoff syndrome, irregular heartbeat, an impaired immune response, liver cirrhosis and increased cancer risk. Drinking during pregnancy can result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Women are generally more sensitive than men to the harmful effects of alcohol.Environmental factors and genetics are two components associated with alcoholism, with about half the risk attributed to each. Someone with a parent or sibling with alcoholism is three to four times more likely to become an alcoholic themselves. Environmental factors include social, cultural and behavioral influences. High stress levels and anxiety, as well as alcohol's inexpensive cost and easy accessibility, increase the risk. People may continue to drink partly to prevent or improve symptoms of withdrawal. After a person stops drinking alcohol, they may experience a low level of withdrawal lasting for months. Medically, alcoholism is considered both a physical and mental illness. Questionnaires and certain blood tests may detect possible alcoholism. Further information is then collected to confirm the diagnosis.Prevention of alcoholism may be attempted by regulating and limiting the sale of alcohol, taxing alcohol to increase its cost, and providing inexpensive treatment. Treatment of alcoholism may take several forms. Due to medical problems that can occur during withdrawal, alcohol detoxification should be carefully controlled. One common method involves the use of benzodiazepine medications, such as diazepam. These can be either given while admitted to a health care institution or occasionally while a person remains in the community with close supervision. Mental illness or other addictions may complicate treatment. After detoxification, group therapy or support groups are used to help keep a person from returning to drinking. One commonly used form of support is the group Alcoholics Anonymous. The medications acamprosate, disulfiram or naltrexone may also be used to help prevent further drinking.The World Health Organization has estimated that as of 2010, there were 208 million people with alcoholism worldwide (4.1% of the population over 15 years of age). As of 2015 in the United States, about 17 million (7%) of adults and 0.7 million (2.8%) of those age 12 to 17 years of age are affected.  Alcoholism is most common among males and young adults, and is less common in middle and old age. Geographically, it is least common in Africa (1.1% of the population) and has the highest rates in Eastern Europe (11%). Alcoholism directly resulted in 139,000 deaths in 2013, up from 112,000 deaths in 1990. A total of 3.3 million deaths (5.9% of all deaths) are believed to be due to alcohol.  Alcoholism reduces a person's life expectancy by approximately ten years. Many terms, some insulting and others informal, have been used to refer to people affected by alcoholism; the expressions include tippler, drunkard, dipsomaniac and souse. In 1979, the World Health Organization discouraged the use of ""alcoholism"" due to its inexact meaning, preferring ""alcohol dependence syndrome"".","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.26","Allergy","","Allergies, also known as allergic diseases, are a number of conditions caused by hypersensitivity of the immune system to typically harmless substances in the environment. These diseases include hay fever, food allergies, atopic dermatitis, allergic asthma, and anaphylaxis. Symptoms may include red eyes, an itchy rash, sneezing, a runny nose, shortness of breath, or swelling. Food intolerances and food poisoning are separate conditions.Common allergens include pollen and certain foods. Metals and other substances may also cause problems. Food, insect stings, and medications are common causes of severe reactions. Their development is due to both genetic and environmental factors. The underlying mechanism involves immunoglobulin E antibodies (IgE), part of the body's immune system, binding to an allergen and then to a receptor on mast cells or basophils where it triggers the release of inflammatory chemicals such as histamine. Diagnosis is typically based on a person's medical history. Further testing of the skin or blood may be useful in certain cases. Positive tests, however, may not mean there is a significant allergy to the substance in question.Early exposure to potential allergens may be protective. Treatments for allergies include avoiding known allergens and the use of medications such as steroids and antihistamines. In severe reactions injectable adrenaline (epinephrine) is recommended. Allergen immunotherapy, which gradually exposes people to larger and larger amounts of allergen, is useful for some types of allergies such as hay fever and reactions to insect bites. Its use in food allergies is unclear.Allergies are common. In the developed world, about 20% of people are affected by allergic rhinitis, about 6% of people have at least one food allergy, and about 20% have atopic dermatitis at some point in time. Depending on the country about 1\u201318% of people have asthma. Anaphylaxis occurs in between 0.05\u20132% of people. Rates of many allergic diseases appear to be increasing. The word ""allergy"" was first used by Clemens von Pirquet in 1906.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.27","Allopathic medicine","","Allopathic medicine, or allopathy, refers to science-based, modern medicine, such as the use of medications or surgery to treat or suppress symptoms or the ill effects of disease.  There are regional variations in usage of the term. In the United States, the term is used to contrast with osteopathic medicine, especially in the field of medical education.\nThe terms were coined in 1810 by the inventor of homeopathy, Samuel Hahnemann . It was originally used by 19th-century homeopaths as a derogatory term for heroic medicine, the traditional European medicine of the time and a precursor to modern medicine that did not rely on evidence of effectiveness. Heroic medicine was based on the belief that disease is caused by imbalance among the four ""humours"" (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile) and sought to treat disease symptoms by correcting that imbalance, using ""harsh and abusive"" methods to induce symptoms seen as opposite to those of diseases  rather than treating their underlying causes: disease was caused by an excess of one humour and thus would be treated with its ""opposite"". Among homeopaths and other alternative medicine advocates, ""allopathic medicine"" now refers to ""the broad category of medical practice that is sometimes called Western medicine, biomedicine, evidence-based medicine, or modern medicine.""  This description continued to be used to describe anything that was not homeopathy.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.28","Alternative medicine","","Alternative medicine describes any practice that aims to achieve the healing effects of medicine, but which lacks biological plausibility and is untested, untestable or proven ineffective. Complementary medicine (CM), complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), integrated medicine or integrative medicine (IM), and holistic medicine are among many rebrandings of the same phenomenon. Alternative therapies share in common that they reside outside medical science, and rely on pseudoscience. Traditional practices become ""alternative"" when used outside their original settings without proper scientific explanation and evidence. Frequently used derogatory terms for the alternative are new-age or pseudo, with little distinction from quackery.\nSome alternative practices are based on theories that contradict the science of how the human body works; others resort to the supernatural or superstitious to explain their effect. In others, the practice is plausibly effective but has too many side-effects. Alternative medicine is distinct from experimental medicine, which employs the scientific method to test plausible therapies by way of responsible and ethical clinical trials, producing evidence of either effect or of no effect. Research into alternative therapies often fails to follow proper research protocols (such as placebo-controlled trials, blind experiments and calculation of prior probability), providing invalid results.\nMuch of the perceived effect of an alternative practice arises from a belief that it will be effective (the placebo effect), or from the treated condition resolving on its own (the natural course of disease). This is further exacerbated by the tendency to turn to alternative therapies upon the failure of medicine, at which point the condition will be at its worst and most likely to spontaneously improve. In the absence of this bias, especially for diseases that are not expected to get better by themselves such as cancer or HIV infection, multiple studies have shown significantly worse outcomes if patients turn to alternative therapies. While this may be because these patients avoid effective treatment, some alternative therapies are actively harmful (e.g. cyanide poisoning from amygdalin, or the intentional ingestion of hydrogen peroxide) or actively interfere with effective treatments.\nThe alternative sector is a highly profitable industry with a strong lobby, and faces far less regulation over the use and marketing of unproven treatments. Its marketing often advertises the treatments as being ""natural"" or ""holistic"", in comparison to those offered by ""big pharma"". Billions of dollars have been spent studying alternative medicine, with little to no positive results. Some of the successful practices are only considered alternative under very specific definitions, such as those which include all physical activity under the umbrella of ""alternative medicine"". \n\n","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.29","Alzheimer's disease","","Alzheimer's disease (AD), also referred to simply as Alzheimer's, is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that usually starts slowly and gradually worsens over time. It is the cause of 60\u201370% of cases of dementia. The most common early symptom is difficulty in remembering recent events. As the disease advances, symptoms can include problems with language, disorientation (including easily getting lost), mood swings, loss of motivation, not managing self-care, and behavioural issues. As a person's condition declines, they often withdraw from family and society. Gradually, bodily functions are lost, ultimately leading to death. Although the speed of progression can vary, the typical life expectancy following diagnosis is three to nine years.The cause of Alzheimer's disease is poorly understood. About 70% of the risk is believed to be inherited from a person's parents with many genes usually involved. Other risk factors include a history of head injuries, depression, and hypertension. The disease process is associated with plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. A probable diagnosis is based on the history of the illness and cognitive testing with medical imaging and blood tests to rule out other possible causes. Initial symptoms are often mistaken for normal ageing. Examination of brain tissue is needed for a definite diagnosis. Mental and physical exercise, and avoiding obesity may decrease the risk of AD; however, evidence to support these recommendations is weak. There are no medications or supplements that have been shown to decrease risk.No treatments stop or reverse its progression, though some may temporarily improve symptoms. Affected people increasingly rely on others for assistance, often placing a burden on the caregiver. The pressures can include social, psychological, physical, and economic elements. Exercise programs may be beneficial with respect to activities of daily living and can potentially improve outcomes. Behavioural problems or psychosis due to dementia are often treated with antipsychotics, but this is not usually recommended, as there is little benefit with an increased risk of early death.In 2015, there were approximately 29.8 million people worldwide with AD. It most often begins in people over 65 years of age, although 4\u20135% of cases are early-onset Alzheimer's. It affects about 6% of people 65 years and older. In 2015, dementia resulted in about 1.9 million deaths. It was first described by, and later named after, German psychiatrist and pathologist Alois Alzheimer in 1906. In developed countries, AD is one of the most financially costly diseases.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.35","Americana","","Americana artifacts are related to the history, geography, folklore and cultural heritage of the United States of America. Americana is any collection of materials and things concerning or characteristic of the United States or of the American people, and is representative or even stereotypical of American culture as a whole.What is and is not considered Americana is heavily influenced by national identity, historical context, patriotism and nostalgia. The ethos or guiding beliefs or ideals which have come to characterize America, such as The American Dream, are central to the idea. American historian Hampton Sides wrote in Americana: Dispatches from the New Frontier:\n\nThe United States of America is such a glorious mess of contradiction, such a crazy quilt of competing themes, such a fecund mishmash of people and ideas, that defining us is pretty much pointless. There is, of course, a kind of faded notion of ""Americana"", one that concerns Route 66, diners, freak rock formations, and the like\u2014but even in its halcyon days this ""roadside attraction"" version of America was never an accurate or nuanced distillation of our massively complicated culture.\nThere are scenes and places, wattages and personages, that belong\u2014inextricably, unmistakably\u2014to this country alone. There is an American quality, a tone, an energy ... instantly recognizable ...""\nMany kinds of cultural artifacts fall within the definition of Americana: the things involved need not be old, but are usually associated with some quintessential element of the American experience. Each period of United States history is reflected by the advertising and marketing of the time, and the various types of antiques, collectibles, memorabilia and vintage items from these time periods are typical of what is popularly considered Americana. The Atlantic described the term as ""slang for the comforting, middle-class ephemera at your average antique store\u2014things like needle-pointed pillows, Civil War daguerreotypes, and engraved silverware sets"". Americana encompasses not only material objects but also people, places, concepts and historical eras which are popularly identified with American culture.\nThe name ""Americana"" also refers to Americana music, a genre of contemporary music which incorporates elements of various American music styles, including country, roots-rock, folk, bluegrass and blues, resulting in a distinctive roots-oriented sound.","wikipedia","5.13"
"3.30","American Airlines Flight 77","","American Airlines Flight 77 was a scheduled American Airlines domestic transcontinental passenger flight from Washington Dulles International Airport in Dulles, Virginia, to Los Angeles International Airport in Los Angeles, California. The Boeing 757-223 aircraft serving the flight was hijacked by five Saudi men affiliated with al-Qaeda on September 11, 2001, as part of the September 11 attacks. They deliberately crashed the plane into the Pentagon in Arlington County, Virginia, near Washington, D.C., killing all 64 people on board, including the five hijackers and six crew, as well as 125 people in the building.\nLess than 35 minutes into the flight, the hijackers stormed the cockpit and forced the passengers, crew, and pilots to the rear of the aircraft. Hani Hanjour, one of the hijackers who was trained as a pilot, assumed control of the flight. Unknown to the hijackers, passengers aboard made telephone calls to friends and family and relayed information on the hijacking.\nThe hijackers crashed the aircraft into the western side of the Pentagon at 09:37 EDT. Many people witnessed the crash, and news sources began reporting on the incident within minutes. The impact severely damaged an area of the Pentagon and caused a large fire. A portion of the building collapsed; firefighters spent days working to fully extinguish the blaze. The damaged sections of the Pentagon were rebuilt in 2002, with occupants moving back into the completed areas that August. The 184 victims of the attack are memorialized in the Pentagon Memorial adjacent to the crash site. The 1.93-acre (7,800 m2) park contains a bench for each of the victims, arranged according to their year of birth, ranging from 1930 to 1998.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.31","American Civil Liberties Union","","The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is a nonprofit organization founded in 1920 ""to defend and preserve the individual rights and liberties guaranteed to every person in this country by the Constitution and laws of the United States"". Officially  nonpartisan, the organization has been supported and criticized by liberal and conservative organizations alike. The ACLU works through litigation and lobbying and it has over 1,200,000 members and an annual budget of over $100 million. Local affiliates of the ACLU are active in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The ACLU provides legal assistance in cases when it considers civil liberties to be at risk. Legal support from the ACLU can take the form of direct legal representation or preparation of amicus curiae briefs expressing legal arguments when another law firm is already providing representation.\nIn addition to representing persons and organizations in lawsuits, the ACLU lobbies for policy positions that have been established by its board of directors. Current positions of the ACLU include: opposing the death penalty; supporting same-sex marriage and the right of LGBT people to adopt; supporting birth control and abortion rights; eliminating discrimination against women, minorities, and LGBT people; supporting the rights of prisoners and opposing torture; and opposing government preference for religion over non-religion, or for particular faiths over others.\nLegally, the ACLU consists of two separate but closely affiliated nonprofit organizations: the American Civil Liberties Union, a 501(c)(4) social welfare group, and the ACLU Foundation, a 501(c)(3) public charity. Both organizations engage in civil rights litigation, advocacy, and education, but only donations to the 501(c)(3) foundation are tax deductible, and only the 501(c)(4) group can engage in unlimited political lobbying. The two organizations share office space and employees.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.32","American Family Association","","The American Family Association (AFA) is a fundamentalist Protestant 501(c)(3) organization based in the United States. It opposes LGBT rights and expression, pornography, and abortion. It also takes a position on a variety of other public policy goals. It was founded in 1977 by Donald Wildmon as the National Federation for Decency and is headquartered in Tupelo, Mississippi.\nThe AFA defined itself as ""a Christian organization promoting the biblical ethic of decency in American society with primary emphasis on television and other media,"" later switching their stated emphasis to ""moral issues that impact the family."" It engages in activism efforts, including boycotts, buycotts, action alert emails, publications on the AFA's web sites or in the AFA Journal, broadcasts on American Family Radio, and lobbying. The organization is accredited by the  Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability (ECFA) and posted a 2011 budget of over $16 million. AFA owns 200 American Family Radio stations in 33 states, seven affiliate stations in seven states, and one affiliate TV station (KAZQ) in New Mexico.AFA has been listed as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) since November 2010 for the ""propagation of known falsehoods"" and the use of ""demonizing propaganda"" against LGBT people.\n\n","wikipedia","5.1"

The group described itself as a national grassroots organization for responsible gun ownership and advocated for increased gun control.  The organization's president, Ray Schoenke, said the AHSA was intended to bridge the gap between urban liberals and rural gun owners, but closed down due to a lack of support from the Obama administration.Critics, including the National Rifle Association, questioned whether the membership was representative of gun owners and suggested it was a front organization for gun control advocates.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.34","American Revolution","","The American Revolution was a colonial revolt which occurred between 1765 and 1783. The American Patriots in the Thirteen Colonies defeated the British in the American Revolutionary War (1775\u20131783) with the assistance of France, winning independence from Great Britain and establishing the United States of America.\nThe American colonials proclaimed ""no taxation without representation"" starting with the Stamp Act Congress in 1765. They had no representatives in the British Parliament and so rejected Parliament's authority to tax them. Protests steadily escalated to the Boston Massacre in 1770 and the burning of the Gaspee in Rhode Island in 1772, followed by the Boston Tea Party in December 1773. The British responded by closing Boston Harbor and enacting a series of punitive laws which effectively rescinded Massachusetts Bay Colony's rights of self-government. The other colonies rallied behind Massachusetts, and a group of American Patriot leaders set up their own government in late 1774 at the Continental Congress to coordinate their resistance of Britain; other colonists retained their allegiance to the Crown and were known as Loyalists or Tories.\nTensions erupted into battle between Patriot militia and British regulars when King George's forces attempted to destroy American military supplies at Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775. The conflict quickly escalated into war, during which the Patriots (and later their French allies) fought the British and Loyalists in the Revolutionary War. Each of the thirteen colonies formed a Provincial Congress which assumed power from the former colonial governments, suppressed Loyalism, and recruited a Continental Army led by General George Washington. The Continental Congress declared King George a tyrant who trampled the colonists' rights as Englishmen, and they declared the colonies free and independent states on July 2, 1776. The Patriot leadership professed the political philosophies of liberalism and republicanism to reject monarchy and aristocracy, and they proclaimed that all men are created equal.\nThe Patriots attempted to invade Canada during the winter of 1775\u201376 without success, expecting like-minded colonists in British Canada to rally to the cause. The newly created Continental Army forced the British military out of Boston in March 1776, but the British captured New York City and its strategic harbor that summer, which they held for the duration of the war. The Royal Navy blockaded ports and captured other cities for brief periods, but they failed to destroy Washington's forces.  The Continental Army captured a British army at the Battle of Saratoga in October 1777, and France then entered the war as an ally of the United States. Britain then refocused its war to make France the main enemy. Britain also attempted to hold the Southern states with the anticipated aid of Loyalists, and the war moved south. Charles Cornwallis captured an army at Charleston, South Carolina in early 1780, but he failed to enlist enough volunteers from Loyalist civilians to take effective control of the territory. Finally, a combined American and French force captured a second British army at Yorktown in the fall of 1781, effectively ending the war. The Treaty of Paris was signed September 3, 1783, formally ending the conflict and confirming the new nation's complete separation from the British Empire. The United States took possession of nearly all the territory east of the Mississippi River and south of the Great Lakes, with the British retaining control of Canada, and Spain taking Florida.\nAmong the significant results of the Revolution were American independence and friendly economic trade with Britain. The Americans adopted the United States Constitution, establishing a strong national government which included an elected executive, a national judiciary, and an elected bicameral Congress representing states in the Senate and the population in the House of Representatives. Around 60,000 Loyalists migrated to other British territories, particularly to British North America (Canada), but the great majority remained in the United States.\n\n","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.37","Anal sex","","Anal sex or anal intercourse is generally the insertion and thrusting of the erect penis into a person's anus, or anus and rectum, for sexual pleasure. Other forms of anal sex include fingering, the use of sex toys for anal penetration, oral sex performed on the anus (anilingus), and pegging. Although anal sex most commonly means penile\u2013anal penetration, sources sometimes use anal intercourse to exclusively denote penile\u2013anal penetration, and anal sex to denote any form of anal sexual activity, especially between pairings as opposed to anal masturbation.While anal sex is commonly associated with male homosexuality, research shows that not all gay males engage in anal sex and that it is not uncommon in heterosexual relationships. Types of anal sex can also be a part of lesbian sexual practices. People may experience pleasure from anal sex by stimulation of the anal nerve endings, and orgasm may be achieved through anal penetration \u2013 by indirect stimulation of the prostate in men, indirect stimulation of the clitoris or an area of the vagina (sometimes called the G-spot) in women, and other sensory nerves (especially the pudendal nerve). However, people may also find anal sex painful, sometimes extremely so, which may be primarily due to psychological factors in some cases.As with most forms of sexual activity, anal sex participants risk contracting sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Anal sex is considered a high-risk sexual practice because of the vulnerability of the anus and rectum. The anal and rectal tissues are delicate and do not provide lubrication like the vagina does, so they can easily tear and permit disease transmission, especially if a personal lubricant is not used. Anal sex without protection of a condom is considered the riskiest form of sexual activity, and therefore health authorities such as the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend safe sex practices for anal sex.Strong views are often expressed about anal sex. It is controversial in various cultures, especially with regard to religious prohibitions. This is commonly due to prohibitions against anal sex among males or teachings about the procreative purpose of sexual activity. It may be considered taboo or unnatural, and is a criminal offense in some countries, punishable by corporal or capital punishment. By contrast, anal sex may also be considered a natural and valid form of sexual activity as fulfilling as other desired sexual expressions, and can be an enhancing or primary element of a person's sex life.","wikipedia","5.7"
"3.38","Anarchism","","Anarchism is a radical political movement and ethical philosophy that is highly skeptical towards authority and rejects all forms of unjust hierarchy. It calls for the abolition of the state which it holds to be undesirable, unnecessary, and harmful. Anarchism advocates for the replacement of the state with stateless societies or other forms of  free associations.\nAnarchism's timeline stretches back to prehistory when people lived in anarchistic societies long before the establishment of formal states, kingdoms or empires. With the rise of organised hierarchical bodies, skepticism towards authority also rose, but it was not until the 19th century a self-conscious political movement was formed. During the latest half of 19th and the first decades of 20th century, the anarchist movement flourished to most parts of the world, and had a significant role in  worker's struggles for emancipation. Various branches of anarchism were espoused during those times. Anarchists took part in several revolutions, most notably in the Spanish Civil War, where they were crushed by the fascist forces in 1939, marking the end of the classical era of anarchism. In the last decades of the 20th century, the anarchist movement nonetheless became relevant and vivid once more.\nAnarchism employs various tactics in order to meet its ideal ends; these can be broadly separated in revolutionary and evolutionary tactics. There is significant overlap between the two legs which are merely descriptive. Revolutionary tactics aim to bring down authority and state, and have taken a violent turn in the past. Evolutionary tactics aim to prefigure what an anarchist society would be like. Anarchism's thought, criticism and praxis has played a part in diverse fields of human society.\n\n","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.39","Anarcho-capitalism","","Anarcho-capitalism is a political philosophy and economic theory that advocates the elimination of centralized states in favor of self-ownership, private property and free markets. Anarcho-capitalists hold that in the absence of statute (which they describe as law by arbitrary autocratic decrees, or bureaucratic legislation swayed by transitory political special interest groups), society tends to contractually self-regulate and civilize through the spontaneous and organic discipline of the free market (in what its proponents describe as a ""voluntary society""). They also support wage labour and believe it is always voluntary. They also believe that private property is possible without a state.\nIn an anarcho-capitalist society, law enforcement, courts and all other security services would be operated by privately funded competitors selected by consumers rather than ""centrally through confiscatory taxation"". Money, along with all other goods and services, would be privately and competitively provided in an open market. Personal and economic activities under anarcho-capitalism would therefore be regulated directly by consumers and their directly selected agents through market-based dispute resolution organizations under tort and contract law, rather than by statute through centrally determined punishment under ""political monopolies"", which they believe tend to generate corruption through the collectivization of property and distortion of market signals.Anarcho-capitalists believe that business regulations, such as corporate standards, public relations, product labels, rules for consumer protection, ethics, and labor relations would be self regulated via the use of competitive trade associations, professional societies, and standards bodies. In theory, this would establish market-recourse for businesses' decisions and allow the market to communicate effectively with businesses by the use of consumer unions, instead of centralized regulatory mandates for companies ""imposed by the state"", which anarcho-capitalists and other libertarians argue are inefficient due to regulatory capture.\nAccording to anarcho-capitalists, various theorists have espoused legal philosophies similar to anarcho-capitalism. However, the first person to use the term in the mid-20th century was Murray Rothbard, who synthesized elements from the Austrian School, classical liberalism and 19th-century American individualist anarchists Lysander Spooner and Benjamin Tucker (while rejecting their labor theory of value and the norms they derived from it). Rothbard's anarcho-capitalist society would operate under a mutually agreed-upon libertarian ""legal code which would be generally accepted, and which the courts would pledge themselves to follow"". This pact would recognize self-ownership, property, contracts, and tort law, in keeping with the universal non-aggression principle.\nAnarcho-capitalists are distinguished from minarchists, who advocate a small Jeffersonian night-watchman state limited to protecting individuals and their properties from foreign and domestic aggression; and from other anarchists, who oppose private ownership of the means of production (tools, factories, raw materials, etc.), rent, and other aspects of capitalism such as wage labour.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.40","Ancient Macedonian language","","Ancient Macedonian, the language of the ancient Macedonians, either a dialect of Ancient Greek, or a separate Hellenic language, was spoken in the kingdom of Macedonia during the 1st millennium BC and belongs to the Indo-European language family. It gradually fell out of use during the 4th century BC, marginalized by the use of Attic Greek by the Macedonian aristocracy, the Ancient Greek dialect that became the basis of Koine Greek, the lingua franca of the Hellenistic period.The surviving public and private inscriptions found in Macedonia indicate that there was no other written language in ancient Macedonia but Ancient Greek, and recent epigraphic discoveries in the Greek region of Macedonia, such as the Pella curse tablet, suggest that ancient Macedonian might have been a variety of North Western Ancient Greek. Other linguistic evidence suggests that although Ancient Greek was the language of literacy, the vernacular was a separate language, although closely related.","wikipedia","5.10"
"3.41","Anencephaly","","Anencephaly is the absence of a major portion of the brain, skull, and scalp that occurs during embryonic development. It is a cephalic disorder that results from a neural tube defect that occurs when the rostral (head) end of the neural tube fails to close, usually between the 23rd and 26th day following conception. Strictly speaking, the Greek term translates as ""no in-head"" (that is, totally lacking the inside part of the head, i.e. the brain), but it is accepted that children born with this disorder usually only lack a telencephalon, the largest part of the brain consisting mainly of the cerebral hemispheres, including the neocortex, which is responsible for  cognition. The remaining structure is usually covered only by a thin layer of membrane\u2014skin, bone, meninges, etc. are all lacking. With very few exceptions, infants with this disorder do not survive longer than a few hours or possibly days after their birth.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.42","Anime","","Anime (US: , UK: ) (Japanese: \u30a2\u30cb\u30e1, Hepburn: anime, [a\u0272ime] (listen), plural: anime) is hand-drawn and computer animation originating from or associated with Japan.\nThe word anime is the Japanese term for animation, which means all forms of animated media. Outside Japan, anime refers specifically to animation from Japan or as a Japanese-disseminated animation style often characterized by colorful graphics, vibrant characters and fantastical themes. The culturally abstract approach to the word's meaning may open up the possibility of anime produced in countries other than Japan. Many Westerners strictly view anime as a Japanese animation product. Some scholars suggest defining anime as specifically or quintessentially Japanese may be related to a new form of Orientalism.The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917, and Japanese anime production has since continued to increase steadily. The characteristic anime art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of Osamu Tezuka and spread internationally in the late twentieth century, developing a large domestic and international audience. Anime is distributed theatrically, by way of television broadcasts, directly to home media, and over the Internet. It is classified into numerous genres targeting diverse broad and niche audiences.\nAnime is a diverse art form with distinctive production methods and techniques that have been adapted over time in response to emergent technologies. It combines graphic art, characterization, cinematography, and other forms of imaginative and individualistic techniques. The production of anime focuses less on the animation of movement and more on the realism of settings as well as the use of camera effects, including panning, zooming, and angle shots. Being hand-drawn, anime is separated from reality by a crucial gap of fiction that provides an ideal path for escapism that audiences can immerse themselves into with relative ease. Diverse art styles are used and character proportions and features can be quite varied, including characteristically large emotive or realistically sized eyes.\nThe anime industry consists of over 430 production studios, including major names like Studio Ghibli, Gainax, and Toei Animation. Despite comprising only a fraction of Japan's domestic film market, anime makes up a majority of Japanese DVD and Blu-ray sales. It has also seen international success after the rise of English-dubbed and subbed programming. This rise in international popularity has resulted in non-Japanese productions using the anime art style. Whether these works are anime-influenced animation or proper anime is a subject for debate amongst fans. Japanese anime accounts for 60% of the world's animated television shows, as of 2016. In 2015, the 44th President of the United States, Barack Obama, referred to anime as one of the loved ones of American youth.","wikipedia","5.13"
"3.36","An Inconvenient Truth","","An Inconvenient Truth is a 2006 American concert/documentary film directed by Davis Guggenheim about former United States Vice President Al Gore's campaign to educate people about global warming. The film features a slide show that, by Gore's own estimate, he has presented over a thousand times to audiences worldwide.\nThe idea to document Gore's efforts came from producer Laurie David, who saw his presentation at a town hall meeting on global warming, which coincided with the opening of The Day After Tomorrow. Laurie David was so inspired by his slide show that she, with producer Lawrence Bender, met with Guggenheim to adapt the presentation into a film. Premiering at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival and opening in New York City and Los Angeles on May 24, 2006, the documentary was a critical and commercial success, winning two Academy Awards for Best Documentary Feature and Best Original Song. The film grossed $24 million in the U.S. and $26 million at the international box office, becoming the eleventh highest grossing documentary film to date in the United States.Since the film's release, An Inconvenient Truth has been credited for raising international public awareness of global warming and reenergizing the environmental movement. The documentary has also been included in science curricula in schools around the world, which has spurred some controversy. A sequel to the film, titled An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power, was released on July 28, 2017.","wikipedia","5.9"
"3.43","Answers in Genesis","","Answers in Genesis (AiG) is an American fundamentalist Christian apologetics parachurch organization. It advocates Young Earth creationism on the basis of its literal, historical-grammatical interpretation of the Book of Genesis. Out of belief in biblical inerrancy, it rejects the results of those scientific investigations that contradict their view of the Genesis creation narrative and instead supports pseudoscientific creation science. The organization sees evolution as incompatible with the Bible and believes anything other than the young Earth view is a compromise on the principle of biblical inerrancy.\nAiG began as the Creation Science Foundation in 1980, following the merger of two Australian creationist groups. Its name changed to Answers in Genesis in 1994, when Ken Ham founded the organization's United States branch. In 2006, the branches in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa split from the US and UK to form Creation Ministries International. In 2007, AiG opened the Creation Museum, a facility that promotes young Earth creationism, and in 2016 the organization opened the Ark Encounter, a Noah's Ark\u2013themed amusement park. AiG also publishes websites, magazines, and journals, and its employees have published books.\n\n","wikipedia","['5.1','5.8']"
"3.44","Anthropology","","Anthropology is the scientific study of humans, human behavior and societies in the past and present. Social anthropology studies patterns of behaviour and cultural anthropology studies cultural meaning, including norms and values. Linguistic anthropology studies how language influences social life. Biological or physical anthropology studies the biological development of humans.\nArchaeology, which studies human activity through investigation of physical evidence, is thought of as a branch of anthropology in the United States and Canada, while in Europe, it is viewed as a discipline in its own right or grouped under other related disciplines, such as history.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.45","Anti-Americanism","","Anti-Americanism (also called anti-American sentiment and Americanophobia) is a sentiment that espouses a dislike of or opposition to the American government or its policies, especially in regards to its foreign policy, or to the United States in general.Political scientist Brendon O'Connor of the United States Studies Centre in Australia suggests that ""anti-Americanism"" cannot be isolated as a consistent phenomenon, since the term originated as a rough composite of stereotypes, prejudices, and criticisms evolving to more politically-based criticism. French scholar Marie-France Toinet says use of the term ""anti-Americanism"" is ""only fully justified if it implies systematic opposition \u2013 a sort of allergic reaction \u2013 to America as a whole.""Discussions on anti-Americanism have in most cases lacked a precise explanation of what the sentiment entails (other than a general disfavor), which has led to the term being used broadly and in an impressionistic manner, resulting in the inexact impressions of the many expressions described as anti-American. Author and expatriate William Russell Melton described that criticism for the United States largely originates from the perception that the U.S. wants to act as a ""world policeman.""Negative or critical views of the United States or its influence are widespread in Russia, China, Cuba, Serbia, the Middle East, and North Korea, but remain low in Vietnam, Israel, the Philippines, Sub-Saharan Africa, South Korea, and certain countries in central and eastern Europe.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.48","Anti-clericalism","","Anti-clericalism is opposition to religious authority, typically in social or political matters. Historical anti-clericalism has mainly been opposed to the influence of Roman Catholicism. Anti-clericalism is related to secularism, which seeks to remove the church from all aspects of public and political life, and its involvement in the everyday life of the citizen.Some have opposed clergy on the basis of moral corruption, institutional issues and/or disagreements in religious interpretation, such as during the Protestant Reformation. Anti-clericalism became extremely violent during the French Revolution because revolutionaries witnessed the church playing a pivotal role in the systems of oppression which led to it. Many clerics were killed, and French revolutionary governments tried to control priests by making them state employees.\nAnti-clericalism appeared in Catholic Europe throughout the 19th century, in various forms, and later in Canada, Cuba, and Latin America.","wikipedia","['5.5','5.1']"
"3.46","Anti-Irish racism","","Anti-Irish sentiment may refer to or include oppression, persecution, discrimination, or hatred of Irish people as an ethnic group or nation, whether directed against the island of Ireland in general or against Irish emigrants and their descendants in the Irish diaspora.\nIt is traditionally rooted in the Middle Ages, Early Modern Age and in the Age of Enlightenment and is also evidenced in Irish immigration to Great Britain, North America, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. Anti-Irish sentiment can include both social, racial and cultural discrimination in Ireland itself, such as sectarianism or cultural religious political conflicts in the Troubles of Northern Ireland.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.47","Anti-Muslim violence in India","","There have been several instances of religious violence against Muslims since the Partition of India in 1947, frequently in the form of violent attacks on Muslims by Hindu mobs that form a pattern of sporadic sectarian violence between the Hindu and Muslim communities. Over 10,000 people have been killed in Hindu-Muslim communal violence since 1950 in 6,933 instances of communal violence between 1954 and 1982.The causes of this violence against Muslims are varied. The roots are thought to lie in India's history \u2013 resentment toward the Islamic conquest of India during the Middle Ages, policies established by the country's British colonizers, and the violent partition of India into an Islamic state of Pakistan and India with a Muslim minority.\nMany scholars believe that incidents of anti-Muslim violence are politically motivated and a part of the electoral strategy of mainstream political parties who are associated with Hindu nationalism like the Bharatiya Janata Party (political wing of  RSS). Other scholars believe that the violence is not widespread but that it is restricted to certain urban areas because of local socio-political conditions.","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.49","Anti-semitism","","Antisemitism (also spelled anti-semitism or anti-Semitism) is hostility to, prejudice, or discrimination against Jews. A person who holds such positions is called an antisemite. Antisemitism is generally considered to be a form of racism.Antisemitism may be manifested in many ways, ranging from expressions of hatred of or discrimination against individual Jews to organized pogroms by mobs, state police, or even military attacks on entire Jewish communities. Although the term did not come into common usage until the 19th century, it is now also applied to historic anti-Jewish incidents. Notable instances of persecution include the Rhineland massacres preceding the First Crusade in 1096, the Edict of Expulsion from England in 1290, the massacres of Spanish Jews in 1391, the persecutions of the Spanish Inquisition, the expulsion from Spain in 1492, the Cossack massacres in Ukraine from 1648 to 1657, various anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire between 1821 and 1906, the 1894\u20131906 Dreyfus affair in France, the Holocaust in German-occupied Europe during World War II, Soviet anti-Jewish policies, and Arab and Muslim involvement in the Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries.\nThe root word Semite gives the false impression that antisemitism is directed against all Semitic people, e.g., including Arabs and Assyrians. The compound word Antisemitismus (""antisemitism"") was first used in print in Germany in 1879 as a scientific-sounding term for Judenhass (""Jew-hatred""), and this has been its common use since then.","wikipedia","['5.5','5.1']"
"3.50","Apartheid","","Apartheid (South African English: ; Afrikaans: [a\u02c8part\u0266\u025bit], segregation; lit. ""aparthood"") was a system of institutionalised racial segregation that existed in South Africa and South West Africa (now Namibia) from 1948 until the early 1990s. Apartheid was characterised by an authoritarian political culture based on baasskap (or white supremacy), which ensured that South Africa was dominated politically, socially, and economically by the nation's minority white population. According to this system of social stratification, white citizens had the highest status, followed in descending order by Asians, Coloureds, and black Africans. The economic legacy and social effects of apartheid continue to the present day.Broadly speaking, apartheid was delineated into petty apartheid, which entailed the segregation of public facilities and social events, and grand apartheid, which dictated housing and employment opportunities by race. Prior to the 1940s, some aspects of apartheid had already emerged in the form of minority rule by white South Africans and the socially enforced separation of black Africans from other races, which later extended to pass laws and land apportionment. Apartheid was adopted as a formal policy by the South African government after the ascension of the National Party (NP) during the 1948 general elections.A codified system of racial stratification began to take form in South Africa under the Dutch Empire in the eighteenth century, although informal segregation was present much earlier due to social cleavages between Dutch colonists and a creolised, ethnically diverse slave population. With the rapid growth and industrialisation of the British Cape Colony in the nineteenth century, racial policies and laws became increasingly rigid. Cape legislation that discriminated specifically against black Africans began appearing shortly before 1900. The policies of the Boer republics were also racially exclusive; for instance, the Transvaal's constitution barred black African and Coloured participation in church and state.The first apartheid law was the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act, 1949, followed closely by the Immorality Amendment Act of 1950, which made it illegal for most South African citizens to marry or pursue sexual relationships across racial lines. The Population Registration Act, 1950 classified all South Africans into one of four racial groups based on appearance, known ancestry, socioeconomic status, and cultural lifestyle: ""Black"", ""White"", ""Coloured"", and ""Indian"", the last two of which included several sub-classifications. Places of residence were determined by racial classification. Between 1960 and 1983, 3.5 million black Africans were removed from their homes and forced into segregated neighbourhoods as a result of apartheid legislation, in some of the largest mass evictions in modern history. Most of these targeted removals were intended to restrict the black population to ten designated ""tribal homelands"", also known as bantustans, four of which became nominally independent states. The government announced that relocated persons would lose their South African citizenship as they were absorbed into the bantustans.Apartheid sparked significant international and domestic opposition, resulting in some of the most influential global social movements of the twentieth century. It was the target of frequent condemnation in the United Nations and brought about an extensive arms and trade embargo on South Africa. During the 1970s and 1980s, internal resistance to apartheid became increasingly militant, prompting brutal crackdowns by the National Party government and protracted sectarian violence that left thousands dead or in detention. Some reforms of the apartheid system were undertaken, including allowing for Indian and Coloured political representation in parliament, but these measures failed to appease most activist groups.Between 1987 and 1993, the National Party entered into bilateral negotiations with the African National Congress (ANC), the leading anti-apartheid political movement, for ending segregation and introducing majority rule. In 1990, prominent ANC figures such as Nelson Mandela were released from prison. Apartheid legislation was repealed on 17 June 1991, pending multiracial elections held under a universal suffrage set for April 1994.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.52","Apollo moon landing hoax accusations","","Moon landing conspiracy theories claim that some or all elements of the Apollo program and the associated Moon landings were hoaxes staged by NASA, possibly with the aid of other organizations. The most notable claim is that the six crewed landings (1969\u20131972) were faked and that twelve Apollo astronauts did not actually walk on the Moon. Various groups and individuals have made claims since the mid-1970s that NASA and others knowingly misled the public into believing the landings happened, by manufacturing, tampering with, or destroying evidence including photos, telemetry tapes, radio and TV transmissions, and Moon rock samples.\nMuch third-party evidence for the landings exists, and detailed rebuttals to the hoax claims have been made. Since the late 2000s, high-definition photos taken by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) of the Apollo landing sites have captured the lander modules and the tracks left by the astronauts. In 2012, images were released showing five of the six Apollo missions' American flags erected on the Moon still standing; the exception is that of Apollo 11, which has lain on the lunar surface since being accidentally blown over by the takeoff rocket's exhaust.Conspiracists have managed to sustain public interest in their theories for more than 40 years, despite the rebuttals and third-party evidence. Opinion polls taken in various locations have shown that between 6% and 20% of Americans, 25% of Britons, and 28% of Russians surveyed believe that the crewed landings were faked. Even as late as 2001, the Fox television network documentary Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land on the Moon? claimed NASA faked the first landing in 1969 to win the Space Race.","wikipedia","5.6"

As a soldier and then an officer, he participated prominently in the 1948 Palestine war, becoming a platoon commander in the Alexandroni Brigade and taking part in many battles, including Operation Bin Nun Alef. He was an instrumental figure in the creation of Unit 101 and the reprisal operations, as well as in the 1956 Suez Crisis, the Six-Day War of 1967, the War of Attrition, and the Yom-Kippur War of 1973. Yitzhak Rabin has called Sharon ""the greatest field commander in our history"".Upon retirement from the military, Sharon entered politics, joining the Likud party, and served in a number of ministerial posts in Likud-led governments in 1977\u201392 and 1996\u201399. As Minister of Defense, he directed the 1982 Lebanon War. An official enquiry found that he bore ""personal responsibility"" for the Sabra and Shatila massacre and recommended that he be removed as Defense Minister. His role in the massacre led to him being known as the ""Butcher of Beirut"" among Arabs.From the 1970s through to the 1990s, Sharon championed construction of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. He became the leader of the Likud in 2000, and served as Israel's prime minister from 2001 to 2006. However, as Prime Minister, in 2004\u201305 Sharon orchestrated Israel's unilateral disengagement from the Gaza Strip. Facing stiff opposition to this policy within the Likud, in November 2005 he left Likud to form a new party, Kadima. He had been expected to win the next election and was widely interpreted as planning on ""clearing Israel out of most of the West Bank"", in a series of unilateral withdrawals. After suffering a stroke on 4 January 2006, Sharon remained in a permanent vegetative state until his death in January 2014.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.54","Armenian Genocide","","The Armenian Genocide (also known as the Armenian Holocaust) was the systematic mass murder and expulsion of 1.5 million ethnic Armenians carried out in Turkey and adjoining regions by the Ottoman government between 1914 and 1923.\n The starting date is conventionally held to be 24 April 1915, the day that Ottoman authorities rounded up, arrested, and deported from Constantinople (now Istanbul) to the region of Angora (Ankara), 235 to 270 Armenian intellectuals and community leaders, the majority of whom were eventually murdered.\nThe genocide was carried out during and after World War I and implemented in two phases\u2014the wholesale killing of the able-bodied male population through massacre and subjection of army conscripts to forced labour, followed by the deportation of women, children, the elderly, and the infirm on death marches leading to the Syrian Desert. Driven forward by military escorts, the deportees were deprived of food and water and subjected to periodic robbery, rape, and massacre. Most Armenian diaspora communities around the world came into being as a direct result of the genocide.Other ethnic groups were similarly targeted for extermination in the Assyrian genocide and the Greek genocide, and their treatment is considered by some historians to be part of the same genocidal policy.Raphael Lemkin was moved specifically by the annihilation of the Armenians to define systematic and premeditated exterminations within legal parameters and to coin the word genocide in 1943. The Armenian Genocide is acknowledged to have been one of the first modern genocides, because scholars point to the organized manner in which the killings were carried out. It is the second-most-studied case of genocide after the Holocaust.Turkey denies that the word genocide is an accurate term for these crimes, but in recent years has been faced with increasing calls to recognize them as such. As of 2019, governments and parliaments of 32 countries, including the United States, Russia, and Germany have recognized the events as a genocide.","wikipedia","5.6"

"3.56","Asian American","","Asian Americans are Americans of Asian ancestry. The term refers to a panethnic group that includes diverse populations, which have origins in East Asia, South Asia, or Southeast Asia, as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau. This includes people who indicate their race(s) on the census as ""Asian"" or reported entries such as ""Chinese, Filipino, Indian, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, and Other Asian"". In 2017, Asian Americans comprised 5.6% of the U.S. population; including multiracial Asian Americans, that percentage increases to 6.9%.Although migrants from Asia have been in parts of the contemporary United States since the 17th century, large-scale immigration did not begin until the mid-19th century. Nativist immigration laws during the 1880s\u20131920s excluded various Asian groups, eventually prohibiting almost all Asian immigration to the continental United States. After immigration laws were reformed during the 1940s\u201360s, abolishing national origins quotas, Asian immigration increased rapidly. Analyses of the 2010 census have shown that Asian Americans are the fastest growing racial or ethnic minority in the United States.","wikipedia","5.5"

"3.58","Aspartame","","Aspartame is an artificial non-saccharide sweetener 200 times sweeter than sucrose, and is commonly used as a sugar substitute in foods and beverages. It is a methyl ester of the aspartic acid/phenylalanine dipeptide with the trade names, NutraSweet, Equal, and Canderel. Aspartame was first made in 1965 and approved for use in food products by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1981.Aspartame is one of the most rigorously tested food ingredients. Reviews by over 100 governmental regulatory bodies found the ingredient safe for consumption at current levels. As of 2018, several reviews of clinical trials showed that using aspartame in place of sugar reduces calorie intake and body weight in adults and children.\n\n","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.59","Aspartame controversy","","The artificial sweetener aspartame has been the subject of several controversies since its initial approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1974. The FDA approval of aspartame was highly contested, beginning with suspicions of its involvement in brain cancer, alleging that the quality of the initial research supporting its safety was inadequate and flawed, and that conflicts of interest marred the 1981 approval of aspartame, previously evaluated by two FDA panels that concluded to keep the approval on hold before further investigation. In 1987, the U.S. Government Accountability Office concluded that the food additive approval process had been followed properly for aspartame. The irregularities fueled a conspiracy theory, which the ""Nancy Markle"" email hoax circulated, along with claims \u2013 counter to the weight of medical evidence \u2013 that numerous health conditions (such as multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus, methanol toxicity, blindness, spasms, shooting pains, seizures, headaches, depression, anxiety, memory loss, birth defects, and death) are caused by the consumption of aspartame in normal doses.Aspartame is a methyl ester of the aspartic acid/phenylalanine dipeptide.  Potential health risks have been examined and dismissed by numerous scientific research projects. With the exception of the risk to those with phenylketonuria, aspartame is considered to be a safe food additive by governments worldwide and major health and food safety organizations. FDA officials describe aspartame as ""one of the most thoroughly tested and studied food additives the agency has ever approved"" and its safety as ""clear cut."" The weight of existing scientific evidence indicates that aspartame is safe as a non-nutritive sweetener.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.60","Asperger's syndrome","","Asperger syndrome (AS), also known as Asperger's, is a developmental disorder characterised by significant difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. As a milder autism spectrum disorder (ASD), it differs from other ASDs by relatively normal language and intelligence. Although not required for diagnosis, physical clumsiness and unusual use of language are common. Signs usually begin before two years of age and typically last for a person's entire life.The exact cause of Asperger's is unknown. While it is largely inherited, the underlying genetics have not been determined conclusively. Environmental factors are also believed to play a role. Brain imaging has not identified a common underlying condition. In 2013, the diagnosis of Asperger's was removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), and people with these symptoms are now included within the autism spectrum disorder along with autism and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). It remains within the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) as of 2019 as a subtype of autism spectrum disorder.There is no single treatment, and the effectiveness of particular interventions is supported by only limited data. Treatment is aimed at lowering obsessive or repetitive routines, and improving communication skills and physical clumsiness. Interventions may include social skills training, cognitive behavioral therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, parent training, and medications for associated problems, such as mood or anxiety. Most children improve as they grow up, but social and communication difficulties usually persist. Some researchers and people on the autism spectrum have advocated a shift in attitudes toward the view that autism spectrum disorder is a difference rather than a disease that must be treated or cured.In 2015, Asperger's was estimated to affect 37.2 million people globally. Autism spectrum disorder affects males more often than females, and females are typically diagnosed at a later age. The syndrome is named after the Austrian pediatrician Hans Asperger, who, in 1944, described children in his care who were clumsy, and lacking in nonverbal communication skills and understanding of others' feelings. The modern conception of Asperger syndrome came into existence in 1981 and went through a period of popularization. It became a standardized diagnosis in the early 1990s. Many questions and controversies remain. There is doubt about whether it is distinct from high-functioning autism (HFA). Partly because of this, the percentage of people affected is not firmly established.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.61","Assisted suicide","","Assisted suicide, also known as assisted dying, is suicide undertaken with the aid of another person. The term usually refers to physician-assisted suicide (PAS), which is suicide that is assisted by a physician or other healthcare provider.  Once it is determined that the person's situation qualifies under the physician-assisted suicide laws for that place, the physician's assistance is usually limited to writing a prescription for a lethal dose of drugs.\nIn many jurisdictions, helping a person die by suicide is a crime. People who support legalizing physician-assisted suicide want the people who assist in a voluntary death to be exempt from criminal prosecution for manslaughter or similar crimes. Physician-assisted suicide is legal in some countries, under certain circumstances, including Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Colombia, Switzerland, and parts of the United States and Australia (Victoria).  In most of those states or countries, to qualify for legal assistance, individuals who seek a physician-assisted suicide must meet certain criteria, including having a terminal illness, proving they are of sound mind, voluntarily and repeatedly expressing their wish to die, and taking a specified, lethal dose of drugs themselves.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.62","Astrology","","Astrology is a pseudoscience that claims to divine information about human affairs and terrestrial events by studying the movements and relative positions of celestial objects. Astrology has been dated to at least the 2nd millennium BCE, and has its roots in calendrical systems used to predict seasonal shifts and to interpret celestial cycles as signs of divine communications. Many cultures have attached importance to astronomical events, and some\u2014such as the Hindus, Chinese, and the Maya\u2014developed elaborate systems for predicting terrestrial events from celestial observations. Western astrology, one of the oldest astrological systems still in use, can trace its roots to 19th\u201317th century BCE Mesopotamia, from which it spread to Ancient Greece, Rome, the Arab world and eventually Central and Western Europe. Contemporary Western astrology is often associated with systems of horoscopes that purport to explain aspects of a person's personality and predict significant events in their lives based on the positions of celestial objects; the majority of professional astrologers rely on such systems.Throughout most of its history, astrology was considered a scholarly tradition and was common in academic circles, often in close relation with astronomy, alchemy, meteorology, and medicine. It was present in political circles and is mentioned in various works of literature, from Dante Alighieri and Geoffrey Chaucer to William Shakespeare, Lope de Vega, and Calder\u00f3n de la Barca.\nFollowing the end of the 19th century and the wide-scale adoption of the scientific method, astrology has been challenged successfully on both theoretical and experimental grounds, and has been shown to have no scientific validity or explanatory power. Astrology thus lost its academic and theoretical standing, and common belief in it has largely declined. While polls have demonstrated that approximately one quarter of American, British, and Canadian people say they continue to believe that star and planet positions affect their lives, astrology is now recognized as a pseudoscience\u2014a belief that is incorrectly presented as scientific.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.63","Atheism","","Atheism is, in the broadest sense, an absence of belief in the existence of deities. Less broadly, atheism is a rejection of the belief that any deities exist.  In an even narrower sense, atheism is specifically the position that there are no deities. Atheism is contrasted with theism, which, in its most general form, is the belief that at least one deity exists.The etymological root for the word atheism originated before the 5th century BCE from the ancient Greek \u1f04\u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c2 (atheos), meaning ""without god(s)"". In antiquity, it had multiple uses as a pejorative term applied to those thought to reject the gods worshiped by the larger society, those who were forsaken by the gods, or those who had no commitment to belief in the gods. The term denoted a social category created by orthodox religionists into which those who did not share their religious beliefs were placed. The actual term atheism emerged first in the 16th century. With the spread of freethought, skeptical inquiry, and subsequent increase in criticism of religion, application of the term narrowed in scope. The first individuals to identify themselves using the word atheist lived in the 18th century during the Age of Enlightenment. The French Revolution, noted for its ""unprecedented atheism,"" witnessed the first major political movement in history to advocate for the supremacy of human reason.Arguments for atheism range from philosophical to social and historical approaches. Rationales for not believing in deities include arguments that there is a lack of empirical evidence, the problem of evil, the argument from inconsistent revelations, the rejection of concepts that cannot be falsified, and the argument from nonbelief. Nonbelievers contend that atheism is a more parsimonious position than theism and that everyone is born without beliefs in deities; therefore, they argue that the burden of proof lies not on the atheist to disprove the existence of gods but on the theist to provide a rationale for theism. Although some atheists have adopted secular philosophies (e.g. secular humanism), there is no one ideology or code of conduct to which all atheists adhere.Since conceptions of atheism vary, accurate estimations of current numbers of atheists are difficult. According to global Win-Gallup International studies, 13% of respondents were ""convinced atheists"" in 2012, 11% were ""convinced atheists"" in 2015, and in 2017, 9% were ""convinced atheists"". However, other researchers have advised caution with WIN/Gallup figures since other surveys which have used the same wording for decades and have a bigger sample size have consistently reached lower figures. An older survey by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) in 2004 recorded atheists as comprising 8% of the world's population. Other older estimates have indicated that atheists comprise 2% of the world's population, while the irreligious add a further 12%. According to these polls, Europe and East Asia are the regions with the highest rates of atheism. In 2015, 61% of people in China reported that they were atheists. The figures for a 2010 Eurobarometer survey in the European Union (EU) reported that 20% of the EU population claimed not to believe in ""any sort of spirit, God or life force"", with France (40%) and Sweden (34%) representing the highest values.","wikipedia","['5.5','5.1']"
"3.64","Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki","","The United States detonated two nuclear weapons over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, with the consent of the United Kingdom, as required by the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings killed between 129,000 and 226,000 people, most of whom were civilians, and remain the first and only use of nuclear weapons in armed conflict.\nIn the final year of World War II, the Allies prepared for a very costly invasion of the Japanese mainland. This undertaking was preceded by a conventional and firebombing campaign which devastated 67 Japanese cities. The war in Europe had concluded when Germany signed its instrument of surrender on May 8, 1945, and the Allies turned their full attention to the Pacific theater. The Allies called for the unconditional surrender of the Imperial Japanese armed forces in the Potsdam Declaration on July 26, 1945, the alternative being ""prompt and utter destruction"". Japan ignored the ultimatum and the war continued.\nBy August 1945, the Allies' Manhattan Project had produced two types of atomic bombs, and the 509th Composite Group of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) was equipped with the specialized Silverplate version of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress that could deliver them from Tinian in the Mariana Islands. The Allies issued orders for atomic bombs to be used on four Japanese cities on July 25. On August 6, one of the modified B-29s dropped a uranium gun-type bomb (""Little Boy"") on Hiroshima. Another B-29 dropped a plutonium implosion bomb (""Fat Man"") on Nagasaki three days later. The bombs immediately devastated their targets. Over the next two to four months, the acute effects of the atomic bombings killed between 90,000 and 146,000 people in Hiroshima and 39,000 and 80,000 people in Nagasaki; roughly half of the deaths in each city occurred on the first day. Large numbers of people continued to die for months afterward from the effects of burns, radiation sickness, and other injuries, compounded by illness and malnutrition. In both cities, most of the dead were civilians, although Hiroshima had a sizable military garrison.\nJapan surrendered to the Allies on August 15, six days after the Soviet Union's declaration of war and the bombing of Nagasaki. The Japanese government signed the instrument of surrender on September 2 in Tokyo Bay, which effectively ended World War II. Scholars have extensively studied the effects of the bombings on the social and political character of subsequent world history and popular culture, and there is still much debate concerning the ethical and legal justification for the bombings.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.65","Attraction to disability","","Attraction to disability is a sexualised interest in the appearance, sensation and experience of disability. It may extend from normal human sexuality into a type of sexual fetishism. Sexologically, the pathological end of the attraction tends to be classified as a paraphilia. (Note, however, that the very concept paraphilia continues to elude satisfactory definition and remains a subject of ongoing debate in both professional and lay communities) Other researchers have approached it as a form of identity disorder. The most common interests are towards amputations, prosthesis, and crutches.","wikipedia","5.7"
"3.66","Austrian School","","The Austrian School is a heterodox school of economic thought that is based on methodological individualism\u2014the concept that social phenomena result exclusively from the motivations and actions of individuals.The Austrian School originated in late-19th and early-20th century Vienna with the work of Carl Menger, Eugen B\u00f6hm von Bawerk, Friedrich von Wieser and others. It was methodologically opposed to the Prussian Historical School (in a dispute known as Methodenstreit). Current-day economists working in this tradition are located in many different countries, but their work is still referred to as Austrian economics. Among the theoretical contributions of the early years of the Austrian School are the subjective theory of value, marginalism in price theory and the formulation of the economic calculation problem, each of which has become an accepted part of mainstream economics.Since the mid-20th century, mainstream economists have been critical of the modern day Austrian School and consider its rejection of mathematical modelling, econometrics and macroeconomic analysis to be outside mainstream economics, or ""heterodox"". Although the Austrian School has been considered heterodox since the late 1930s, it attracted renewed interest in the 1970s after Friedrich Hayek shared the 1974 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences.\n\n","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.67","Autoerotic Asphyxiation","","Erotic asphyxiation (variously called asphyxiophilia, hypoxyphilia or breath control play) is the intentional restriction of oxygen to the brain for the purposes of sexual arousal. The term autoerotic asphyxiation is used when the act is done by a person to themselves. Colloquially, a person engaging in the activity is sometimes called a gasper.The erotic interest in asphyxiation is classified as a paraphilia in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association.\nErotic asphyxiation can lead to accidental death due to asphyxia.","wikipedia","5.7"
"3.68","Autogynephilia","","Blanchard's transsexualism typology is a psychological typology of gender dysphoria, transsexualism, and fetishistic transvestism, created by Ray Blanchard through the 1980s and 1990s, building on the work of prior researchers, including his colleague, Kurt Freund. Blanchard categorized trans women into two groups: ""homosexual transsexuals"" who are attracted exclusively to men, and who seek sex reassignment surgery because they are feminine in both behavior and appearance; and ""autogynephilic transsexuals"" who are sexually aroused at the idea of having a female body. Blanchard's typology broke from earlier ones in that neither of the groups were considered ""false transsexuals""; both autogynephilic and homosexual transsexuals were shown to benefit from transition. Before Blanchard, the idea that some types were not transsexual at all was a recurring theme in scholarly literature.Supporters of the typology include sexologists J. Michael Bailey, Anthony Bogaert, James Cantor, Kurt Freund, Anne Lawrence, bioethicist Alice Dreger, and others who cite evidence showing significant differences between the two groups, including sexuality, age of transition, ethnicity, IQ, fetishism, and quality of adjustment. Criticism of the typology has come from sexologists John Bancroft and Charles Allen Moser, psychologist Margaret Nichols, academics Larry Nuttbrock and Jaimie Veale. Julia Serano criticized Blanchard's choice of wording as confusing or degrading.In the transgender community, the typology has been the subject of controversy, which drew public attention with the publication of Bailey's The Man Who Would Be Queen in 2003.\n\n","wikipedia","5.7"
"3.70","Balto-Slavic languages","","The Balto-Slavic languages are a branch of the Indo-European family of languages. It traditionally comprises the Baltic and Slavic languages. Baltic and Slavic languages share several linguistic traits not found in any other Indo-European branch, which points to a period of common development. Although the notion of a Balto-Slavic unity has been contested (partly due to political controversies), there is now a general consensus among specialists in Indo-European linguistics to classify Baltic and Slavic languages into a single branch, with only some details of the nature of their relationship remaining in dispute.A Proto-Balto-Slavic language is reconstructable by the comparative method, descending from Proto-Indo-European by means of well-defined sound laws, and out of which modern Slavic and Baltic languages descended. One particularly innovative dialect separated from the Balto-Slavic dialect continuum and became ancestral to the Proto-Slavic language, from which all Slavic languages descended.\n\n","wikipedia","5.10"
"3.71","Banking","","A bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates credit. Lending activities can be performed either directly or indirectly through capital markets. Due to their importance in the financial stability of a country, banks are highly regulated in most countries. Most nations have institutionalized a system known as fractional reserve banking under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities. In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity, banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards, known as the Basel Accords.\nBanking in its modern sense evolved in the fourteenth century in the prosperous cities of Renaissance Italy but in many ways was a continuation of ideas and concepts of credit and lending that had their roots in the ancient world. In the history of banking, a number of banking dynasties \u2013 notably, the Medicis, the Fuggers, the Welsers, the Berenbergs, and the Rothschilds \u2013 have played a central role over many centuries. The oldest existing retail bank is Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, while the oldest existing merchant bank is Berenberg Bank.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.72","Baptist","","Baptists form a major branch of Protestantism distinguished by baptizing professing believers only (believer's baptism, as opposed to infant baptism), and doing so by complete immersion (as opposed to affusion or aspersion). Baptist churches also generally subscribe to the doctrines of soul competency (the responsibility and accountability of every person before God), sola fide (salvation by faith alone), sola scriptura (scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice) and congregationalist church government. Baptists generally recognize two ordinances: baptism and communion.\nDiverse from their beginning, those identifying as Baptists today differ widely from one another in what they believe, how they worship, their attitudes toward other Christians, and their understanding of what is important in Christian discipleship.Historians trace the earliest ""Baptist"" church to 1609 in Amsterdam, Dutch Republic with English Separatist John Smyth as its pastor. In accordance with his reading of the New Testament, he rejected baptism of infants and instituted baptism only of believing adults. Baptist practice spread to England, where the General Baptists considered Christ's atonement to extend to all people, while the Particular Baptists believed that it extended only to the elect. Thomas Helwys formulated a distinctively Baptist request that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have freedom of religion. Helwys died in prison as a consequence of the religious conflict with English dissenters under King James I. In 1638, Roger Williams established the first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the First and Second Great Awakening increased church membership in the United States.   Baptist missionaries have spread their faith to every continent.","wikipedia","5.1"

In addition, he is commander-in-chief of the Syrian Armed Forces and Regional Secretary of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party's branch in Syria. His father, Hafez al-Assad, was also President of Syria from 1971 to 2000.\nBorn and raised in Damascus, Assad graduated from the medical school of Damascus University in 1988 and began to work as a doctor in the Syrian Army. Four years later, he attended postgraduate studies at the Western Eye Hospital in London, specialising in ophthalmology. In 1994, after his elder brother Bassel died in a car crash, Bashar was recalled to Syria to take over Bassel's role as heir apparent. He entered the military academy, taking charge of the Syrian military presence in Lebanon in 1998.\nPolitical scientists have characterized the Assad family's rule of Syria as a personalist dictatorship. On 10 July 2000, Assad was elected as President, succeeding his father, who died in office a month prior. In the 2000 and subsequent 2007 election, he received 99.7% and 97.6% support, respectively, in non-competitive, non-democratic elections. On 16 July 2014, Assad was sworn in for another seven-year term after winning another non-competitive, non-democratic election. The election was held only in areas controlled by the Syrian government during the country's ongoing civil war and was criticized by the UN, the Syrian opposition and its Western countries, while Syria's allies stated that the election was ""free and fair"". The Assad government describes itself as secular, while some political scientists have claimed that the government exploits sectarian tensions in the country and relies upon the Alawite minority to remain in power.Previously seen by many states as a potential reformer, the United States, the European Union and the majority of the Arab League called for Assad's resignation from the presidency after he ordered crackdowns and military sieges on Arab Spring protesters, which led to the Syrian Civil War. During the Syrian Civil War, an inquiry by the United Nations reported finding evidence which implicated Assad in war crimes. The UN and international chemical weapons inspectors also concluded that the Assad regime has been behind chemical weapons attacks against civilians. In June 2014, Assad was included in a list of war crimes indictments of government officials and rebels handed to the International Criminal Court. Assad has rejected allegations of war crimes and criticised the American-led intervention in Syria for attempting regime change.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.74","Basque language","","Basque (; euskara [eus\u033a\u02c8ka\u027ea]) is a language spoken in the Basque Country, a region that straddles the westernmost Pyrenees in adjacent parts of northern Spain and southwestern France. Linguistically, Basque is unrelated to the other languages of Europe and is a language isolate in relation to any other known living language. The Basques are indigenous to, and primarily inhabit, the Basque Country. The Basque language is spoken by 28.4% (751,500) of Basques in all territories. Of these, 93.2% (700,300) are in the Spanish area of the Basque Country and the remaining 6.8% (51,200) are in the French portion.Native speakers live in a contiguous area that includes parts of four Spanish provinces and the three ""ancient provinces"" in France. Gipuzkoa, most of Biscay, a few municipalities of \u00c1lava, and the northern area of Navarre formed the core of the remaining Basque-speaking area before measures were introduced in the 1980s to strengthen the language. By contrast, most of \u00c1lava, the western part of Biscay and central and southern areas of Navarre are predominantly populated by native speakers of Spanish, either because Basque was replaced by Spanish over the centuries, in some areas (most of \u00c1lava and central Navarre), or because it was possibly never spoken there, in other areas (parts of the Enkarterri and southeastern Navarre).\nIn Francoist Spain, Basque language use was affected by the repressive policies. In the Basque Country, ""Francoist repression was not only political, but also linguistic and cultural"". The regime placed legal restrictions on the use of language, which was suppressed from official discourse, education, and publishing, making it illegal to register new-born babies under Basque names, and even requiring tombstone engravings in Basque to be removed. In some provinces, the public use of the language was suppressed, with people fined for speaking Basque. Public use of Basque was frowned upon by supporters of the regime, often regarded as a sign of anti-Francoism or separatism. Overall, in the 1960s and later, the trend reversed and education and publishing in Basque began to flourish. As a part of this process, a standardised form of the Basque language, called Euskara Batua, was developed by the Euskaltzaindia in the late 1960s.\nBesides its standardised version, the five historic Basque dialects are Biscayan, Gipuzkoan, and Upper Navarrese in Spain, and Navarrese\u2013Lapurdian and Souletin in France. They take their names from the historic Basque provinces, but the dialect boundaries are not congruent with province boundaries. Euskara Batua was created so that the Basque language could be used\u2014and easily understood by all Basque speakers\u2014in formal situations (education, mass media, literature), and this is its main use today. In both Spain and France, the use of Basque for education varies from region to region and from school to school.A language isolate, Basque is believed to be one of the few surviving pre-Indo-European languages in Europe, and is the only one in Western Europe. The origin of the Basques and of their languages is not conclusively known, though the most accepted current theory is that early forms of Basque developed before the arrival of Indo-European languages in the area, including the Romance languages that geographically surround the Basque-speaking region. Basque has adopted a good deal of its vocabulary from the Romance languages, and Basque speakers have in turn lent their own words to Romance speakers.\nThe Basque alphabet uses the Latin script.\n\n","wikipedia","5.10"
"3.75","Bates method","","The Bates method is an ineffective alternative therapy aimed at improving eyesight. Eye-care physician William Horatio Bates, M.D. (1860\u20131931) attributed nearly all sight problems to habitual strain of the eyes, and felt that glasses were harmful and never necessary. Bates self-published a book, Perfect Sight Without Glasses, as well as a magazine, Better Eyesight Magazine, (and earlier collaborated with Bernarr MacFadden on a correspondence course) detailing his approach to helping people relax such ""strain"", and thus, he claimed, improve their sight. His techniques centered on visualization and movement. He placed particular emphasis on imagining black letters and marks, and the movement of such. He also proposed that exposing the eyes to sunlight would help alleviate the ""strain"".Despite continued anecdotal reports of successful results, including well-publicised support by Aldous Huxley, Bates' techniques have not been objectively shown to improve eyesight. His main physiological proposition\u2014that the eyeball changes shape to maintain focus\u2014has consistently been contradicted by observation. In 1952, optometry professor Elwin Marg wrote of Bates, ""Most of his claims and almost all of his theories have been considered false by practically all visual scientists."" Marg concluded that the Bates method owed its popularity largely to ""flashes of clear vision"" experienced by many who followed it. Such occurrences have since been explained as a contact lens-like effect of moisture on the eye, or a flattening of the lens by the ciliary muscles.The Bates method has been criticized not only because there is no good evidence it works, but also because it can have negative consequences for those who attempt to follow it: they might damage their eyes through overexposure of their eyes to sunlight, put themselves and others at risk by not wearing their corrective lenses while driving, or neglect conventional eye care, possibly allowing serious conditions to develop.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.76","Battle of Cuito Cuanavale","","The Battle of Cuito Cuanavale was fought intermittently between August 14, 1987 and March 23, 1988, south and east of the town of Cuito Cuanavale, Angola, by the People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola (FAPLA, the armed wing of the MPLA), Cuba, South Africa, and insurgents of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) during the Angolan Civil War and South African Border War. The battle was the largest engagement of the Angolan conflict and the biggest conventional battle on the African continent since World War II. UNITA and its South African allies defeated a major FAPLA offensive towards Mavinga, preserving the former's control of southern Angola. They proceeded to launch a bloody but inconclusive counteroffensive on FAPLA defensive positions around the Tumpo River east of Cuito Cuanavale.\nFollowing a number of failed attempts to take the settlements in 1986, eight FAPLA brigades mustered for a final offensive\u2014Opera\u00e7\u00e3o Saludando Octubre\u2014in August 1987 with extensive auxiliary support from one of Angola's closest military allies, the Soviet Union. The FAPLA offensive took the form of a two-pronged, multi-divisional movement southwards towards Mavinga, a major UNITA stronghold and logistics centre. Once Mavinga was in its hands, FAPLA intended to expel the remaining insurgents from Moxico Province and pave the way for a final assault on the UNITA headquarters at Jamba. The Soviet Union supplied FAPLA with over a billion dollars' worth of new military hardware for the purpose of this offensive, and between 4 and 9 Soviet advisers were attached to each FAPLA unit on the brigade level.South Africa, which shared a common border with Angola through the contested territory of South West Africa (Namibia), was then determined to prevent FAPLA from gaining control of Mavinga and allowing insurgents of the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN) to operate in the region. Saludando Octubre prompted the South African Defence Force (SADF) to underpin the defence of Mavinga and launch Operation Moduler with the objective of stopping FAPLA's advance. After weeks of preliminary skirmishes, the two armies met at the Lomba River on September 6.  Throughout September and October, the SADF repulsed several FAPLA attempts to cross the Lomba and destroyed most of the latter's vital bridging equipment. Repeated counterattacks by the SADF's 61 Mechanised Battalion Group resulted in the annihilation of FAPLA's 47 Brigade and the loss of its remaining bridgeheads, sending the remainder of the FAPLA units reeling back towards Cuito Cuanavale.During the second phase of the campaign, the SADF and UNITA made several unsuccessful attempts to encircle and destroy the surviving FAPLA forces before they could establish new defensive positions east of Cuito Cuanavale, an initiative known as Operation Hooper. However, FAPLA succeeded in concentrating its forces within a cramped perimetre between the Cuito, Tumpo, and Dala rivers known as the ""Tumpo Triangle"". They were reinforced by a number of Cuban armoured and motorised units, who had become more directly committed to the fighting for the first time since the beginning of Cuba's military intervention in Angola in 1975. The SADF and UNITA launched six heavy assaults on the Tumpo Triangle under the auspices of Operation Packer,  inflicting serious casualties on FAPLA. Despite suffering significant losses, the defending FAPLA and Cuban troops held their lines. The SADF and UNITA disengaged in March 1988, after laying a series of minefields southeast of Cuito Cuanavale to dissuade a renewed FAPLA offensive.Both sides claimed victory. The Cuban and FAPLA defenders had interpreted the SADF's Tumpo Triangle campaign as part of a larger effort to seize the town of Cuito Cuanavale itself and presented their stand there as a successful defensive action. The SADF maintained that it had achieved its basic objectives of halting the FAPLA offensive during the Lomba River campaign without needing to occupy Cuito Cuanavale, which would have entailed unacceptable losses to its expeditionary force.Today, the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale is credited by some with ushering in the first round of trilateral negotiations, mediated by the United States, which secured the withdrawal of Cuban and South African troops from Angola and Namibia by 1991.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.69","BDSM","","BDSM is a variety of often erotic practices or roleplaying involving bondage, discipline, dominance and submission, sadomasochism, and other related interpersonal dynamics. Given the wide range of practices, some of which may be engaged in by people who do not consider themselves as practising BDSM, inclusion in the BDSM community or subculture is usually dependent upon self-identification and shared experience.\n\nThe term ""BDSM"" is first recorded in a Usenet posting from 1991, and is interpreted as a combination of the abbreviations B/D (Bondage and Discipline), D/s (Dominance and submission), and S/M (Sadism and Masochism). BDSM is now used as a catch-all phrase covering a wide range of activities, forms of interpersonal relationships, and distinct subcultures. BDSM communities generally welcome anyone with a non-normative streak who identifies with the community; this may include cross-dressers, body modification enthusiasts, animal roleplayers, rubber fetishists, and others.\nActivities and relationships within a BDSM context are often characterized by the participants taking on complementary, but unequal roles; thus, the idea of informed consent of both the partners is essential. The terms ""submissive"" and ""dominant"" are often used to distinguish these roles: the dominant partner (""dom"") takes psychological control over the submissive (""sub""). The terms ""top"" and ""bottom"" are also used: the top is the instigator of an action while the bottom is the receiver of the action. The two sets of terms are subtly different: for example, someone may choose to act as bottom to another person, for example, by being whipped, purely recreationally, without any implication of being psychologically dominated by them, or a submissive may be ordered to massage their dominant partner.  Despite the bottom performing the action and the top receiving they have not necessarily switched roles.\nThe abbreviations ""sub"" and ""dom"" are frequently used instead of ""submissive"" and ""dominant"". Sometimes the female-specific terms ""mistress"", ""domme"" or ""dominatrix"" are used to describe a dominant woman, instead of the gender-neutral term ""dom"". Individuals who can change between top/dominant and bottom/submissive roles\u2014whether from relationship to relationship or within a given relationship\u2014are known as switches. The precise definition of roles and self-identification is a common subject of debate within the community.","wikipedia","5.7"

"3.78","Berlin Wall","","The Berlin Wall (German: Berliner Mauer, pronounced [b\u025b\u0281\u02c8li\u02d0n\u0250 \u02c8ma\u028a\u032f\u0250] (listen)) was a guarded concrete barrier that physically and ideologically divided Berlin from 1961 to 1989. Construction of the Wall was commenced by the German Democratic Republic (GDR, East Germany) on 13 August 1961. The Wall cut off West Berlin from surrounding East Germany, including East Berlin. The barrier included guard towers placed along large concrete walls, accompanied by a wide area (later known as the ""death strip"") that contained anti-vehicle trenches, beds of nails, and other defenses. The Eastern Bloc portrayed the Wall as protecting its population from fascist elements conspiring to prevent the ""will of the people"" from building a socialist state in East Germany.\nGDR authorities officially referred to the Berlin Wall as the Anti-Fascist Protection Rampart (German: Antifaschistischer Schutzwall). The West Berlin city government sometimes referred to it as the ""Wall of Shame"", a term coined by mayor Willy Brandt in reference to the Wall's restriction on freedom of movement. Along with the separate and much longer Inner German border (IGB), which demarcated the border between East and West Germany, it came to physically symbolize the ""Iron Curtain"" that separated Western Europe and the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War.Before the Wall's erection, 3.5 million East Germans circumvented Eastern Bloc emigration restrictions and defected from the GDR, many by crossing over the border from East Berlin into West Berlin; from there they could then travel to West Germany and to other Western European countries. Between 1961 and 1989, the Wall prevented almost all such emigration. During this period, over 100,000 people attempted to escape, and over 5,000 people succeeded in escaping over the Wall, with an estimated death toll ranging from 136 to more than 200 in and around Berlin.\nIn 1989, a series of revolutions in nearby Eastern Bloc countries\u2014in Poland and Hungary in particular\u2014caused a chain reaction in East Germany that ultimately resulted in the demise of the Wall. After several weeks of civil unrest, the East German government announced on 9 November 1989 that all GDR citizens could visit West Germany and West Berlin. Crowds of East Germans crossed and climbed onto the Wall, joined by West Germans on the other side in a celebratory atmosphere. Over the next few weeks, euphoric people and souvenir hunters chipped away parts of the Wall. The Brandenburg Gate, a few meters from the Berlin Wall, was opened on 22 December 1989. The demolition of the Wall officially began on 13 June 1990 and was completed in November 1991. The ""fall of the Berlin Wall"" paved the way for German reunification, which formally took place on 3 October 1990.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.79","Biafra","","Biafra, officially the Republic of Biafra, was a state in West Africa that existed from May 1967 to January 1970. It was made up of the states in the Eastern Region of Nigeria.\nBiafra's declaration of independence from Nigeria resulted in civil war between Biafra and Nigeria. Biafra was formally recognised by Gabon, Haiti, Ivory Coast, Tanzania and Zambia. Other nations, which did not give official recognition but provided support and assistance to Biafra, included Israel, France, Spain, Portugal, Norway, Rhodesia, South Africa and Vatican City.A Biafra received aid from non-state actors, including Joint Church Aid, Holy Ghost Fathers of Ireland, and under their direction Caritas International, and U.S. Catholic Relief Services. M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (Doctors Without Borders) also originated in response to the suffering.\nIts inhabitants were mostly Igbo, who led the independence movement due to economic, ethnic, cultural and religious tensions among the various peoples of Nigeria. Other ethnic groups included the Efik, Ibibio, Annang, Ejagham, Eket, Ibeno and the Ijaw.\nAfter two-and-a-half years of war, during which almost two million Biafran civilians died from starvation caused by the total blockade of the region by the Nigerian and British governments, Biafran forces under Nigeria's motto of ""No-victor, No-vanquished"" surrendered to the Nigerian Federal Military Government (FMG). The surrender was facilitated by the Biafran Vice President and Chief of General Staff, Major General Philip Effiong, who assumed leadership of the Republic of Biafra after the original President, Colonel Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, fled to Ivory Coast. After the surrender of Biafra, some Igbos who had fled the conflict returned to their properties but were unable to claim them back from new occupants. This became law in the Abandoned Properties Act (28 September 1979). It was purported that at the start of the civil war, Igbos withdrew their funds from Nigerian banks and converted it to the Biafran currency. After the war, bank accounts owned by Biafrans were seized and a Nigerian panel resolved to give every Igbo person with an account only 20 pounds. Today, Federal projects in Biafra were also greatly reduced compared to other parts of Nigeria. In an Intersociety study it was found that Nigerian security forces also extorted approximately $100 million per year from illegal roadblocks and other methods from Igboland, a cultural sub-region of Biafra in what is now southern Nigeria.\n\n","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.80","Biblical literalism","","Biblical literalism or biblicism is a term used differently by different authors concerning biblical interpretation. It can equate to the dictionary definition of literalism: ""adherence to the exact letter or the literal sense"", where literal means ""in accordance with, involving, or being the primary or strict meaning of the word or words; not figurative or metaphorical"".Alternatively, the term can refer to the historical-grammatical method, a hermeneutic technique that strives to uncover the meaning of the text by taking into account not just the grammatical words, but also the syntactical aspects, the cultural and historical background, and the literary genre. It emphasizes the referential aspect of the words in the text without denying the relevance of literary aspects, genre, or figures of speech within the text (e.g., parable, allegory, simile, or metaphor). It does not necessarily lead to complete agreement upon one single interpretation of any given passage. This Christian fundamentalist and evangelical hermeneutical approach to scripture is used extensively by fundamentalist Christians, in contrast to the historical-critical method of mainstream Judaism or Mainline Protestantism. Those who relate biblical literalism to the historical-grammatical method use the word ""letterism"" to cover interpreting the Bible according to the dictionary definition of literalism.","wikipedia","5.1"

""Official bilingualism"" is the term used in Canada to collectively describe the policies, constitutional provisions, and laws that ensure legal equality of English and French in the Parliament and courts of Canada, protect the linguistic rights of English and French-speaking minorities in different provinces, and ensure a level of government services in both languages across Canada.In addition to the symbolic designation of English and French as official languages, official bilingualism is generally understood to include any law or other measure that:\n\nmandates that the federal government conduct its business in both official languages and provide government services in both languages;\nencourages or mandates lower tiers of government (most notably the provinces and territories, but also some municipalities) to conduct themselves in both official languages and to provide services in both English and French rather than in just one or the other;\nplaces obligations on private actors in Canadian society to provide access to goods or services in both official languages (such as the requirement that food products be labelled in both English and French);\nprovides support to non-government actors to encourage or promote the use or the status of one or the other of the two official languages. This includes grants and contributions to groups representing the English-speaking minority in Quebec and the French-speaking minorities in the other provinces to assist with the establishment of an infrastructure of cultural supports and services.At the provincial level, New Brunswick officially recognizes the equal status of French and English. While French has equal legal status in Manitoba restored due to a court ruling that struck down seventy-year-old English-only laws in 1985, in practice, French language services are only provided in some regions of the province. Quebec has declared itself officially unilingual (French only). Alberta and Saskatchewan are also considered unilingual (English only). In practice, all provinces, including Quebec, offer some services in both English and French and some publicly funded education in both official languages up to the high school level (English language postsecondary education institutions are also present in Quebec, as are French language postsecondary institutions in other provinces, in particular in Manitoba, Ontario and New Brunswick). English and French are official languages in all three territories. In addition, Inuktitut is also an official language in Nunavut, and nine aboriginal languages have official status in the Northwest Territories.\n\n","wikipedia","5.10"
"3.83","Bioethics","","Bioethics is the study of the ethical issues emerging from advances in biology and medicine.  It is also moral discernment as it relates to medical policy and practice. Bioethics are concerned with the ethical questions that arise in the relationships among life sciences, biotechnology, medicine and medical ethics, politics, law, theology and philosophy. It includes the study of values relating to primary care and other branches of medicine (""the ethics of the ordinary""). Ethics also relates to many other sciences outside the realm of biological sciences.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.84","Biology and sexual orientation","","The relationship between biology and sexual orientation is a subject of research. While scientists do not know what determines an individual's sexual orientation, they theorize that it is caused by a complex interplay of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences. Hypotheses for the impact of the post-natal social environment on sexual orientation, however, are weak, especially for males.Biological theories for explaining the causes of sexual orientation are favored by scientists. These factors, which may be related to the development of a sexual orientation, include genes, the early uterine environment (such as prenatal hormones), and brain structure.\n\n","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.85","Birth defect","","A birth defect, also known as a congenital disorder, is a condition present at birth regardless of its cause. Birth defects may result in disabilities that may be physical, intellectual, or developmental. The disabilities can range from mild to severe. Birth defects are divided into two main types: structural disorders in which problems are seen with the shape of a body part and functional disorders in which problems exist with how a body part works. Functional disorders include metabolic and degenerative disorders. Some birth defects include both structural and functional disorders.Birth defects may result from genetic or chromosomal disorders, exposure to certain medications or chemicals, or certain infections during pregnancy. Risk factors include folate deficiency, drinking alcohol or smoking during pregnancy, poorly controlled diabetes, and a mother over the age of 35 years old. Many are believed to involve multiple factors. Birth defects may be visible at birth or diagnosed by screening tests. A number of defects can be detected before birth by different prenatal tests.Treatment varies depending on the defect in question. This may include therapy, medication, surgery, or assistive technology. Birth defects affected about 96 million people as of 2015. In the United States, they occur in about 3% of newborns. They resulted in about 628,000 deaths in 2015, down from 751,000 in 1990. The types with the greatest numbers of deaths are congenital heart disease (303,000), followed by neural tube defects (65,000).","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.86","BitTorrent","","BitTorrent (abbreviated to BT) is a communication protocol for peer-to-peer file sharing (P2P) which is used to distribute data and electronic files over the Internet.\nBitTorrent is one of the most common protocols for transferring large files, such as digital video files containing TV shows or video clips or digital audio files containing songs. Peer-to-peer networks have been estimated to collectively account for approximately 43% to 70% of all Internet traffic (depending on location) as of February 2009.

"3.92","Black hole information paradox","","The black hole information paradox is a puzzle resulting from the combination of quantum mechanics and general relativity.  Calculations suggest that physical information could permanently disappear in a black hole, allowing many physical states to devolve into the same state. This is controversial because it violates a core precept of modern physics\u2014that in principle the value of a wave function of a physical system at one point in time should determine its value at any other time. A fundamental postulate of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics is that complete information about a system is encoded in its wave function up to when the wave function collapses. The evolution of the wave function is determined by a unitary operator, and unitarity implies that information is conserved in the quantum sense.\nAs of November 2019, the paradox may have been resolved, at least for simplified models of gravity (see Recent developments).","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.89","Black Lives Matter","","Black Lives Matter (BLM) is an international activist movement, originating in the African-American community, that campaigns against violence and systemic racism towards black people. BLM regularly holds protests speaking out against police killings of black people, and broader issues such as racial profiling, police brutality, and racial inequality in the United States criminal justice system.In 2013, the movement began with the use of the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter on social media after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of African-American teen Trayvon Martin in February 2012. The movement became nationally recognized for street demonstrations following the 2014 deaths of two African Americans: Michael Brown\u2014resulting in protests and unrest in Ferguson, a city near St. Louis\u2014and Eric Garner in New York City. Since the Ferguson protests, participants in the movement have demonstrated against the deaths of numerous other African Americans by police actions or while in police custody. In the summer of 2015, Black Lives Matter activists became involved in the 2016 United States presidential election. The originators of the hashtag and call to action, Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi, expanded their project into a national network of over 30 local chapters between 2014 and 2016. The overall Black Lives Matter movement, however, is a decentralized network and has no formal hierarchy.There have been many reactions to the Black Lives Matter movement. The U.S. population's perception of Black Lives Matter varies considerably by race. The phrase ""All Lives Matter"" sprang up as a response to the Black Lives Matter movement, but has been criticized for dismissing or misunderstanding the message of ""Black Lives Matter"". Following the shooting of two police officers in Ferguson, the hashtag Blue Lives Matter was created by supporters of the police. Some black civil rights leaders have disagreed with tactics used by Black Lives Matter activists. By the summer of 2017, the movement was getting significantly less attention, which some people attribute to Donald Trump's presidency dominating national headlines.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.90","Black Metal","","Black metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. Common traits include fast tempos, a shrieking vocal style, heavily distorted guitars played with tremolo picking, raw (lo-fi) recording, unconventional song structures, and an emphasis on atmosphere. Artists often appear in corpse paint and adopt pseudonyms.\nDuring the 1980s, several thrash metal and death metal bands formed a prototype for black metal. This so-called first wave included bands such as Venom, Bathory, Mercyful Fate, Hellhammer and Celtic Frost. A second wave arose in the early 1990s, spearheaded by Norwegian bands such as Mayhem, Darkthrone, Burzum, Immortal, Emperor, Satyricon and Gorgoroth. The early Norwegian black metal scene developed the style of their forebears into a distinct genre. Norwegian-inspired black metal scenes emerged throughout Europe and North America, although some other scenes developed their own styles independently. Some prominent Swedish bands spawned during this second wave, the second generation in Sweden being led by Dissection, Abruptum,, Marduk, and Nifelheim.Initially a synonym for ""Satanic metal"", black metal has often sparked controversy, due to the actions and ideologies associated with the genre. Many artists express extreme anti-Christian and misanthropic views, advocating various forms of Satanism or ethnic paganism. In the 1990s, members of the scene were responsible for a spate of church burnings and murders. There is also a small neo-Nazi movement within black metal, although it has been shunned by many prominent artists. Generally, black metal strives to remain an underground phenomenon.\n\n","wikipedia","5.13"
"3.91","Black Power","","Black Power is a political slogan and a name for various associated ideologies aimed at achieving self-determination for people of African descent. It is used primarily, but not exclusively, by  African Americans in the United States. The Black Power movement was prominent in the late 1960s and early 1970s, emphasizing racial pride and the creation of black political and cultural institutions to nurture and promote black collective interests and advance black values.\nThe basis of Black Power is various ideologies that aim at achieving self-determination for black people in the U.S. Black power dictates that blacks create their own identities despite being subjected to pre-existing societal factors.""Black Power"" expresses a range of political goals, from defense against racial oppression, to the establishment of social institutions and a self-sufficient economy, including black-owned bookstores, cooperatives, farms, and media. However, the movement was criticized for alienating itself from the mainstream civil rights movement, for its apparent support of racial segregation, and for constituting black superiority over other races.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.93","Black supremacy","","Black supremacy or black supremacism is a racial supremacist belief which maintains that black people are superior to people of other races. The term has been used by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), an American legal advocacy organization, to describe several fringe religious groups in the United States.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.94","Blood transfusion","","Blood transfusion is the process of transferring blood or blood products into one's circulation intravenously. Transfusions are used for various medical conditions to replace lost components of the blood. Early transfusions used whole blood, but modern medical practice commonly uses only components of the blood, such as red blood cells, white blood cells, plasma, clotting factors, and platelets.\nRed blood cells (RBC) contain hemoglobin, and supply the cells of the body with oxygen. White blood cells are not commonly used during transfusion, but are part of the immune system, and fight infections. Plasma is the liquid part of the blood, which acts as a buffer, and contains proteins and important substances needed for the body's overall health. Platelets are involved in blood clotting, preventing the body from bleeding. Before these components were known, doctors believed that blood was homogenous. Because of this, many patients died because incompatible blood was transferred to them.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.95","Bloody Sunday (1972)","","Bloody Sunday, or the Bogside Massacre, was a mass shooting on 30 January 1972 in the Bogside area of Derry, Northern Ireland, when British soldiers shot 26 unarmed civilians during a protest march against internment without trial. 14 people died: 13 were killed outright, while the death of another man four months later was attributed to his injuries. Many of the victims were shot while fleeing from the soldiers, and some were shot while trying to help the wounded. Other protesters were injured by shrapnel, rubber bullets or batons, and two were run down by army vehicles. All of those shot were Catholics. The march had been organised by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA). The soldiers were from the 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment (""1 Para""). This battalion was involved in two other controversial shootings: the Ballymurphy massacre several months before and the killing of Protestant civilians in the Shankill several months after.\nTwo investigations were held by the British government. The Widgery Tribunal, held in the immediate aftermath, largely cleared the soldiers and British authorities of blame. It described the soldiers' shooting as ""bordering on the reckless"", but accepted their claims that they shot at gunmen and bomb-throwers. The report was widely criticised as a ""whitewash"". The Saville Inquiry, chaired by Lord Saville of Newdigate, was established in 1998 to reinvestigate the incident. Following a 12-year investigation, Saville's report was made public in 2010 and concluded that the killings were both ""unjustified"" and ""unjustifiable"". It found that all of those shot were unarmed, that none were posing a serious threat, that no bombs were thrown and that soldiers ""knowingly put forward false accounts"" to justify their firing. The soldiers denied shooting the named victims but also denied shooting anyone by mistake. On publication of the report, the British prime minister David Cameron made a formal apology on behalf of the United Kingdom. Following this, police began a murder investigation into the killings.\nBloody Sunday  came to be regarded as one of the most significant events of the Troubles, because many civilians were killed by forces of the state, in full view of the public and the press. It was the highest number of people killed in a single shooting incident during the conflict. Bloody Sunday fuelled Catholic and Irish nationalist hostility towards the British Army and worsened the conflict. Support for the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) rose, and there was a surge of recruitment into the organisation, especially locally.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.96","Blu-ray Disc","","Blu-ray or Blu-ray Disc (BD) is a digital optical disc data storage format. It was designed to supersede the DVD format, and is capable of storing several hours of video in high-definition (HDTV 720p and 1080p). The main application of Blu-ray is as a medium for video material such as feature films and for the physical distribution of video games for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. The name ""Blu-ray"" refers to the blue laser (which is actually a violet laser) used to read the disc, which allows information to be stored at a greater density than is possible with the longer-wavelength red laser used for DVDs.\nThe plastic disc is 120 millimetres (4.7 in) in diameter and 1.2 millimetres (0.047 in) thick, the same size as DVDs and CDs. Conventional or pre-BD-XL Blu-ray discs contain 25 GB per layer, with dual-layer discs (50 GB) being the industry standard for feature-length video discs. Triple-layer discs (100 GB) and quadruple-layer discs (128 GB) are available for BD-XL re-writer drives.High-definition (HD) video may be stored on Blu-ray discs with up to 1920\u00d71080 pixel resolution, at 24 progressive, or 50/60 interlaced, frames per second. DVD-Video discs were limited to a maximum resolution of 480p (NTSC, 720\u00d7480 pixels) or 576p (PAL, 720\u00d7576 pixels). Besides these hardware specifications, Blu-ray is associated with a set of multimedia formats.\nThe BD format was developed by the Blu-ray Disc Association, a group representing makers of consumer electronics, computer hardware, and motion pictures. Sony unveiled the first Blu-ray disc prototypes in October 2000, and the first prototype player was released in April 2003 in Japan. Afterwards, it continued to be developed until its official release on June 20, 2006, beginning the high-definition optical disc format war, where Blu-ray Disc competed with the HD DVD format. Toshiba, the main company supporting HD DVD, conceded in February 2008, and later released its own Blu-ray Disc player in late 2009. According to Media Research, high-definition software sales in the United States were slower in the first two years than DVD software sales. Blu-ray faces competition from video on demand (VOD) and the continued sale of DVDs. Notably, as of January 2016, 44% of U.S. broadband households had a Blu-ray player. For playback of 4K content Blu-ray has been superseded by Ultra HD Blu-ray.","wikipedia","5.4"
"3.97","Book of Enoch","","The Book of Enoch (also 1 Enoch; Ge'ez: \u1218\u133d\u1210\u1348 \u1204\u1296\u12ad ma\u1e63\u1e25afa h\u0113nok) is an ancient Hebrew apocalyptic religious text, ascribed by tradition to Enoch, the great-grandfather of Noah.  Enoch contains unique material on the origins of demons and giants, why some angels fell from heaven, an explanation of why the Great Flood was morally necessary, and prophetic exposition of the thousand-year reign of the Messiah.\nThe older sections (mainly in the Book of the Watchers) of the text are estimated to date from about 300\u2013200 BCE, and the latest part (Book of Parables) probably to 100 BCE.Various Aramaic fragments found in the Dead Sea Scrolls, as well as Koine Greek and Latin fragments, were proof that The Book of Enoch was known by Jews and early Christians. This book was also quoted by some 1st and 2nd century authors as in the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs. Authors of the New Testament were also familiar with some content of the story. A short section of 1 Enoch (1:9) is cited in the New Testament, Epistle of Jude, Jude 1:14\u201315, and is attributed there to ""Enoch the Seventh from Adam"" (1 En 60:8), although this section of 1 Enoch is a midrash on Deuteronomy 33:2. Several copies of the earlier sections of 1 Enoch were preserved among the Dead Sea Scrolls.It is not part of the biblical canon used by Jews, apart from Beta Israel (Ethiopian Jews). Most Christian denominations and traditions may accept the Books of Enoch as having some historical or theological interest and while the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church consider the Books of Enoch as canonical, other Christian groups regard them as non-canonical or non-inspired.\nIt is wholly extant only in the Ge'ez language, with Aramaic fragments from the Dead Sea Scrolls and a few Greek and Latin fragments. For this and other reasons, the traditional Ethiopian belief is that the original language of the work was Ge'ez, whereas modern scholars argue that it was first written in either Aramaic or Hebrew; Ephraim Isaac suggests that the Book of Enoch, like the Book of Daniel, was composed partially in Aramaic and partially in Hebrew. No Hebrew version is known to have survived. It is asserted in the book itself that its author was Enoch, before the Biblical Flood.\nThe most complete Book of Enoch comes from Ethiopic manuscripts, ma\u1e63\u1e25afa h\u0113nok, written in Ge'ez; which was brought to Europe by James Bruce in the late 18th century and was translated into English in the 19th century.","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.98","Boricua Popular Army","","The Ej\u00e9rcito Popular Boricua (""Boricua Popular/People's Army""), also known as Los Macheteros (""The Machete Wielders""), is a clandestine organization based in Puerto Rico, with cells in the states and other nations. It campaigns for, and supports, the independence of Puerto Rico from the United States.\nDuring their first decade of existence, they had an average of two actions per year. The group claimed responsibility for the 1978 bombing of a small power station in the San Juan area, the 1979 retaliation attacks against the United States armed forces personnel, the 1981 attacks on Puerto Rico Air National Guard aircraft, and a 1983 Wells Fargo bank robbery.\nBoricua Popular Army was led primarily by former FBI fugitive Filiberto Ojeda R\u00edos until his killing by the FBI in 2005. Ojeda Rios's killing was termed ""an illegal killing"" by the Government of Puerto Rico's Comisi\u00f3n de Derechos Civiles (Civil Rights Commission) after a seven-year investigation and a 227-page report issued on 22 September 2011.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.99","Born-Again","","Born again, or to experience the new birth, is a phrase, particularly in evangelicalism, that refers to ""spiritual rebirth"", or a regeneration of the human spirit from the Holy Spirit, contrasted with physical birth.\nIn contemporary Christian usage, the term is distinct from sometimes similar terms used in mainstream Christianity to refer to being or becoming Christian, which is linked to baptism. Individuals who profess to be ""born again"" often state that they have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. The phrase ""born again"" is also used as an adjective to describe individual members of the movement who espouse this belief, as well as the movement itself (""born-again Christian"" and the ""born-again movement"").\n\n","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.100","Bosnia and Herzegovina","","Bosnia and Herzegovina, abbreviated BiH or B&H, sometimes called Bosnia\u2013Herzegovina and often known informally as Bosnia, is a country of South and Southeast Europe, located within the Balkans. Sarajevo is the capital and largest city.\nBosnia and Herzegovina is almost a landlocked country \u2013 to the south it has a narrow coast on the Adriatic Sea, about 20 kilometres (12 miles) long and surrounding the town of Neum. It is bordered by Serbia to the east, Montenegro to the southeast, and Croatia surrounding north and southwest. In the central and eastern interior of the country the geography is mountainous, in the northwest moderately hilly, and the northeast predominantly flatland. The inland, Bosnia, is a geographically larger region and has a moderate continental climate, with hot summers and cold and snowy winters. The southern tip, Herzegovina, has a Mediterranean climate and mostly mountainous topography.\nBosnia and Herzegovina traces permanent human settlement back to the Neolithic age, during and after which it was populated by several Illyrian and Celtic civilizations. Culturally, politically, and socially, the country has a rich history, having been first settled by the Slavic peoples that populate the area today from the 6th through to the 9th centuries. In the 12th century the Banate of Bosnia was established, which evolved into the Kingdom of Bosnia in the 14th century, after which it was annexed into the Ottoman Empire, under whose rule it remained from the mid-15th to the late 19th centuries. The Ottomans brought Islam to the region, and altered much of the cultural and social outlook of the country. This was followed by annexation into the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, which lasted up until World War I. In the interwar period, Bosnia and Herzegovina was part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and after World War II, it was granted full republic status in the newly formed Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Following the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the republic proclaimed independence in 1992, which was followed by the Bosnian War, lasting until late 1995.\nTourism in Bosnia and Herzegovina has grown at double digit rates in recent years. Bosnia and Herzegovina is regionally and internationally renowned for its natural environment and cultural heritage inherited from six historical civilizations, its cuisine, winter sports, its eclectic and unique music, architecture, and its festivals, some of which are the largest and most prominent of their kind in Southeastern Europe. The country is home to three main ethnic groups or, officially, constituent peoples, as specified in the constitution. Bosniaks are the largest group of the three, with Serbs second, and Croats third. A native of Bosnia and Herzegovina, regardless of ethnicity, is usually identified in English as a Bosnian. Minorities, defined under the constitutional nomenclature ""Others"", include Jews, Roma, Poles, Ukrainians, and Turks. Bosnia and Herzegovina has a bicameral legislature and a three-member Presidency composed of a member of each major ethnic group. However, the central government's power is highly limited, as the country is largely decentralized and comprises two autonomous entities: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska, with a third unit, the Br\u010dko District, governed under local government. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina consists of 10 cantons.\nBosnia and Herzegovina ranks highly in terms of human development, and has an economy dominated by the industry and agriculture sectors, followed by the tourism and service sectors. The country has a social security and universal healthcare system, and primary- and secondary-level education is tuition-free. It is a member of the UN, OSCE, Council of Europe, PfP, CEFTA, and a founding member of the Union for the Mediterranean upon its establishment in July 2008. The country is an applicant for membership to the European Union and has been a candidate for NATO membership since April 2010, when it received a Membership Action Plan.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.101","Breast cancer","","Breast cancer is cancer that develops from breast tissue. Signs of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, fluid coming from the nipple, a newly-inverted nipple, or a red or scaly patch of skin. In those with distant spread of the disease, there may be bone pain, swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath, or yellow skin.Risk factors for developing breast cancer include being female, obesity, a lack of physical exercise, alcoholism, hormone replacement therapy during menopause, ionizing radiation, an early age at first menstruation, having children late in life or not at all, older age, having a prior history of breast cancer, and a family history of breast cancer. About 5\u201310% of cases are the result of a genetic predisposition inherited from a person's parents, including BRCA1 and BRCA2 among others. Breast cancer most commonly develops in cells from the lining of milk ducts and the lobules that supply these ducts with milk. Cancers developing from the ducts are known as ductal carcinomas, while those developing from lobules are known as lobular carcinomas. There are more than 18 other sub-types of breast cancer. Some, such as ductal carcinoma in situ, develop from pre-invasive lesions. The diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed by taking a biopsy of the concerning tissue. Once the diagnosis is made, further tests are done to determine if the cancer has spread beyond the breast and which treatments are most likely to be effective.The balance of benefits versus harms of breast cancer screening is controversial. A 2013 Cochrane review found that it was unclear if mammographic screening does more harm than good, in that a large proportion of women who test positive turn out not to have the disease. A 2009 review for the US Preventive Services Task Force found evidence of benefit in those 40 to 70 years of age, and the organization recommends screening every two years in women 50 to 74 years of age. The medications tamoxifen or raloxifene may be used in an effort to prevent breast cancer in those who are at high risk of developing it. Surgical removal of both breasts is another preventative measure in some high risk women. In those who have been diagnosed with cancer, a number of treatments may be used, including surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and targeted therapy. Types of surgery vary from breast-conserving surgery to mastectomy. Breast reconstruction may take place at the time of surgery or at a later date. In those in whom the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, treatments are mostly aimed at improving quality of life and comfort.Outcomes for breast cancer vary depending on the cancer type, the extent of disease, and the person's age. The five-year survival rates in England and the United states are between 80 and 90%. In developing countries, five-year survival rates are lower. Worldwide, breast cancer is the leading type of cancer in women, accounting for 25% of all cases. In 2018 it resulted in 2 million new cases and 627,000 deaths. It is more common in developed countries and is more than 100 times more common in women than in men.\n\n","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.102","Brexit","","Brexit (; a portmanteau of ""British"" and ""exit"") is the withdrawal of the United Kingdom (UK) from the European Union (EU). Following a UK-wide referendum in June 2016, in which 52% voted to leave and 48% voted to remain in the EU, the British government formally announced the country's withdrawal in March 2017, beginning the Brexit process. The withdrawal was delayed by deadlock in the British parliament. Following a general election, Parliament ratified the withdrawal agreement, and the UK left the EU at 11 p.m. GMT on 31 January 2020. This began a transition period that is set to end on 31 December 2020, during which the UK and EU will negotiate their future relationship. The UK remains subject to EU law and remains part of the EU customs union and single market during the transition, but is no longer part of the EU's political bodies or institutions.Withdrawal was advocated by Eurosceptics and opposed by pro-Europeanists, with both spanning the political spectrum. The UK joined the European Communities (EC) \u2013 principally the European Economic Community (EEC) \u2013 in 1973, and its continued membership was endorsed in a 1975 referendum. In the 1970s and 1980s, withdrawal from the EC was advocated mainly by the political left, e.g. in the Labour Party's 1983 election manifesto. The 1992 Maastricht Treaty founded the EU, but was not put to a referendum. The Eurosceptic wing of the Conservative Party led a rebellion over ratification of the treaty and, with the UK Independence Party (UKIP) and the cross-party People's Pledge campaign, pressured the Conservative prime minister David Cameron to hold a referendum on continued EU membership, which was held in June 2016. Cameron, who had campaigned to remain, resigned after the result and was succeeded by Theresa May.\nOn 29 March 2017, the UK government formally began the withdrawal process by invoking Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union with permission from Parliament. May called a snap general election in June 2017, which resulted in a Conservative minority government supported by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). UK\u2013EU withdrawal negotiations began later that month. The UK negotiated to leave the EU customs union and single market. This resulted in the November 2018 withdrawal agreement, but the British parliament voted against ratifying it three times. The Labour Party wanted any agreement to maintain a customs union, while many Conservatives opposed the agreement's financial settlement, as well as the ""Irish backstop"" designed to prevent border controls between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The Liberal Democrats, Scottish National Party (SNP), and others sought to reverse Brexit through a proposed second referendum.\nIn March 2019, the British parliament voted for May to ask the EU to delay Brexit until April, and then later October. Having failed to get her agreement approved, May resigned as Prime Minister in July and was succeeded by Boris Johnson. He sought to replace parts of the agreement and vowed to leave the EU by the new deadline. On 17 October 2019, the British government and the EU agreed on a revised withdrawal agreement, with new arrangements for Northern Ireland. Parliament approved the agreement for further scrutiny, but rejected passing it into law before the 31 October deadline, and forced the government (through the ""Benn Act"") to ask for a third Brexit delay. An early general election was then held on 12 December. The Conservatives won a large majority in that election, with Johnson declaring that the UK would leave the EU in early 2020. The withdrawal agreement was ratified by the UK on 23 January and by the EU on 30 January; it came into force on 31 January.Many effects of Brexit depend on how closely the UK will be tied to the EU, or whether the transition period ends without terms being agreed (a ""no-deal Brexit""). The broad consensus among economists is that Brexit will likely harm the UK's economy and reduce its real per capita income in the long term, and that the referendum itself damaged the economy. However, the inaccuracy of pre-referendum forecasts has been criticised by the chief economist at the Bank of England. Brexit is likely to reduce immigration from European Economic Area (EEA) countries to the UK, and poses challenges for UK higher education, academic research and security. Following Brexit, EU law and the EU Court of Justice no longer have supremacy over UK laws or its Supreme Court, except to a temporary extent. The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 retains relevant EU law as domestic law, which the UK could then amend or repeal.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.103","British National Party","","The British National Party (BNP) is a far-right, fascist political party in the United Kingdom. It is headquartered in Wigton, Cumbria, and its current leader is Adam Walker. A minor party, it has no elected representatives at any level of UK government. Founded in 1982, the party reached its greatest level of success in the 2000s, when it had over fifty seats in local government, one seat on the London Assembly, and two Members of the European Parliament.\nTaking its name from that of a defunct 1960s far-right party, the BNP was created by John Tyndall and other former members of the fascist National Front (NF). During the 1980s and 1990s, the BNP placed little emphasis on contesting elections, in which it did poorly. Instead, it focused on street marches and rallies, creating the Combat 18 paramilitary\u2014its name a coded reference to Nazi German leader Adolf Hitler\u2014to protect its events from anti-fascist protesters. A growing 'moderniser' faction was frustrated by Tyndall's leadership, and ousted him in 1999. The new leader Nick Griffin sought to broaden the BNP's electoral base by presenting a more moderate image, targeting concerns about rising immigration rates, and emphasising localised community campaigns. This resulted in increased electoral growth throughout the 2000s, to the extent that it became the most electorally successful far-right party in British history. Concerns regarding financial mismanagement resulted in Griffin being removed from office in 2014. By this point the BNP's membership and vote share had declined dramatically, groups like Britain First and National Action had splintered off, and the English Defence League had supplanted it as the UK's foremost far-right group.\nIdeologically positioned on the extreme-right or far-right of British politics, the BNP has been characterised as fascist or neo-fascist by political scientists. Under Tyndall's leadership, it was more specifically regarded as neo-Nazi. The party is ethnic nationalist, and it espouses the view that only white people should be citizens of the United Kingdom. It calls for an end to non-white migration into the UK and for non-white Britons to be stripped of citizenship and removed from the country. Initially, it called for the compulsory expulsion of non-whites, although since 1999 has advocated voluntary removals with financial incentives. It promotes biological racism and the white genocide conspiracy theory, calling for global racial separatism and condemning interracial relationships. Under Tyndall, the BNP emphasised anti-semitism and Holocaust denial, promoting the conspiracy theory that Jews seek to dominate the world through both communism and international capitalism. Under Griffin, the party's focus switched from anti-semitism towards Islamophobia. It promotes economic protectionism, Euroscepticism, and a transformation away from liberal democracy, while its social policies oppose feminism, LGBT rights, and societal permissiveness.\nOperating around a highly centralised structure that gave its chair near total control, the BNP built links with far-right parties across Europe and created various sub-groups, including a record label and trade union. The BNP attracted most support from within White British working-class communities in northern and eastern England, particularly among middle-aged and elderly men. Polls suggested that most Britons favoured a ban on the party. It faced much opposition from anti-fascists, religious organisations, the mainstream media, and most politicians, and BNP members were banned from various professions.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.104","Bromberg Bloody Sunday","","Bloody Sunday (German: Bromberger Blutsonntag; Polish: Krwawa niedziela) was a sequence of events that took place in Bydgoszcz (German: Bromberg), a Polish city with a sizable German minority, between 3 and 4 September 1939, during the German invasion of Poland.\nAfter German Selbstschutz snipers fired on retreating Polish troops, there was a Polish reaction against the German minority and then the retaliatory execution of Polish hostages by the Wehrmacht and Selbstschutz, after the fall of the city. All these events resulted in the deaths of both German and Polish civilians. The Polish Institute of National Remembrance found and confirmed 254 Lutheran victims, assumed to be German civilians, and 86 Catholic victims, assumed to be Polish civilians, as well as 20 Polish soldiers. Approximately 600\u2013800 Polish hostages were shot in a mass execution in the aftermath of the fall of the city as a ""revenge"".\nAfter the Germans took over the city, they killed 1,200\u20133,000 Polish civilians in retaliation, as part of Operation Tannenberg. The event and place of execution became known as the Valley of Death. The murdered included the president of Bydgoszcz, Leon Barciszewski. Fifty Polish prisoners of war from Bydgoszcz were later accused by Nazi Sondergericht Bromberg summary courts for taking part in ""Bloody Sunday"" and shot.\nThe term ""Bloody Sunday"" was created and supported by Nazi propaganda officials. An instruction issued to the press said, ""... must show news on the barbarism of Poles against Germans in Bromberg. The expression 'Bloody Sunday' must enter as a permanent term in the dictionary and circumnavigate the globe. For that reason, this term must be continuously underlined.""","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.105","Buddhism","","Buddhism (, US: ) is the world's fourth-largest religion with over 520 million followers, or over 7% of the global population, known as Buddhists.\nBuddhism encompasses a variety of traditions, beliefs and spiritual practices largely based on original teachings attributed to the Buddha and resulting interpreted philosophies. It originated in ancient India as a Sramana tradition sometime between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE, spreading through much of Asia. Two major extant branches of Buddhism are generally recognized by scholars: Theravada (Pali: ""The School of the Elders"") and Mahayana (Sanskrit: ""The Great Vehicle"").\nMost Buddhist traditions share the goal of overcoming suffering and the cycle of death and rebirth, either by the attainment of Nirvana or through the path of Buddhahood. Buddhist schools vary in their interpretation of the path to liberation, the relative importance and canonicity assigned to the various Buddhist texts, and their specific teachings and practices. Widely observed practices include taking refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha, observance of moral precepts, monasticism, meditation, and the cultivation of the Paramitas (perfections, or virtues).\nTheravada Buddhism has a widespread following in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia such as Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand. Mahayana, which includes the traditions of Pure Land, Zen, Nichiren Buddhism, Shingon and Tiantai (Tendai), is found throughout East Asia.\nVajrayana, a body of teachings attributed to Indian adepts, may be viewed as a separate branch or as an aspect of Mahayana Buddhism. Tibetan Buddhism, which preserves the Vajrayana teachings of eighth-century India, is practised in the countries of the Himalayan region, Mongolia, and Kalmykia.","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.106","Bullfighting","","Bullfighting is a physical contest that involves humans and animals attempting to publicly subdue, immobilise, or kill a bull, usually according to a set of rules, guidelines, or cultural expectations. There are many different forms and varieties in various locations around the world.  Some forms involve dancing around or  over a cow or bull, or attempting to grasp an object from the animal.\nThe best-known form of bullfighting is Spanish-style bullfighting, a traditional spectacle in countries including Spain, Portugal, parts of southern France, Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela and Peru. While some forms are sometimes considered to be a blood sport, in some countries, for example Spain, it is defined as an art form or cultural event and relevant regulatory frameworks liken it to other cultural events and heritage. In Spain, toreros (bullfighters) are almost as popular as football stars, often supported by sponsors and appearing in press. A particular breed of cattle, the Spanish Fighting Bull, is used for this type of bullfighting; in addition these bulls must be bred in large ranches with as little contact with humans as possible.\nThere are many historic fighting venues in the Iberian Peninsula, France, and Latin America. The largest venue of its kind is the Plaza M\u00e9xico in central Mexico City, which seats 48,000 people, and the oldest are the Plazas of B\u00e9jar and Ronda, in the Spanish provinces of Salamanca and M\u00e1laga. \nThe practice of bullfighting is controversial because of a range of concerns including animal welfare, funding, and religion. Bullfighting is illegal in most countries, but remains legal in most areas of Spain and Portugal, as well as in some Hispanic American countries and some parts of southern France.","wikipedia","5.12"
"3.107","Bumfights","","Bumfights: A Cause for Concern is a film produced by Indecline Films. The video features primarily high school fights caught on tape and homeless men (most notably Rufus Hannah and Donnie Brennan) in the San Diego, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas metropolitan areas attempting amateur stunts in a style inspired by the popular MTV series Jackass. Bumfights: A Cause for Concern (2002), was produced by Ryen McPherson, with friends Zachary Bubeck, Daniel J. Tanner, and Michael Slyman, as Indecline Films. Contrary to its title, the video does not depict homeless men actually fighting, but instead a compilation of street fights caught on tape and homeless men performing in skits and stunts.\nThe video series immediately gained criticism. The US-based National Coalition for the Homeless (NCH), a homeless advocacy group, has stated that the Bumfights videos foster contempt for the homeless and dehumanize them. In April 2006, the four original filmmakers agreed not to produce any more Bumfights videos or distribute videos already made, and to pay three homeless men depicted in the videos, under a settlement announced shortly before a lawsuit was due to go to trial.\n\n","wikipedia","5.12"
"3.110","Cable News","","News broadcasting is the medium of broadcasting of various news events and other information via television, radio, or internet in the field of broadcast journalism. The content is usually either produced locally in a radio studio or television studio newsroom, or by a broadcast network. It may also include additional material such as sports coverage weather forecasts, traffic reports, commentary, and other material that the broadcaster feels is relevant to their audience.","wikipedia","5.13"
"3.111","Caesarean section","","Caesarean section, also known as C-section, or caesarean delivery, is the use of surgery to deliver babies. A caesarean section is often necessary when a vaginal delivery would put the baby or mother at risk. Reasons for this may include obstructed labor, twin pregnancy, high blood pressure in the mother, breech birth, or problems with the placenta or umbilical cord. A caesarean delivery may be performed based upon the shape of the mother's pelvis or history of a previous C-section. A trial of vaginal birth after C-section may be possible. The World Health Organization recommends that caesarean section be performed only when medically necessary. Some C-sections are performed without a medical reason, upon request by someone, usually the mother.A C-section typically takes 45 minutes to an hour. It may be done with a spinal block, where the woman is awake, or under general anesthesia. A urinary catheter is used to drain the bladder, and the skin of the abdomen is then cleaned with an antiseptic. An incision of about 15 cm (6 inches) is then typically made through the mother's lower abdomen. The uterus is then opened with a second incision and the baby delivered. The incisions are then stitched closed. A woman can typically begin breastfeeding as soon as she is out of the operating room and awake. Often, several days are required in the hospital to recover sufficiently to return home.C-sections result in a small overall increase in poor outcomes in low-risk pregnancies. They also typically take longer to heal from, about six weeks, than vaginal birth. The increased risks include breathing problems in the baby and amniotic fluid embolism and postpartum bleeding in the mother. Established guidelines recommend that caesarean sections not be used before 39 weeks of pregnancy without a medical reason. The method of delivery does not appear to have an effect on subsequent sexual function.In 2012, about 23 million C-sections were done globally. The international healthcare community has previously considered the rate of 10% and 15% to be ideal for caesarean sections. Some evidence finds a higher rate of 19% may result in better outcomes. More than 45 countries globally have C-section rates less than 7.5%, while more than 50 have rates greater than 27%. Efforts are being made to both improve access to and reduce the use of C-section. In the United States as of 2017, about 32% of deliveries are by C-section. The surgery has been performed at least as far back as 715 BC following the death of the mother, with the baby occasionally surviving. Descriptions of mothers surviving date back to 1500. With the introduction of antiseptics and anesthetics in the 19th century, survival of both the mother and baby became common.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.112","Cancer","","Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body. These contrast with benign tumors, which do not spread. Possible signs and symptoms include a lump, abnormal bleeding, prolonged cough, unexplained weight loss, and a change in bowel movements. While these symptoms may indicate cancer, they can also have other causes. Over 100 types of cancers affect humans.Tobacco use is the cause of about 22% of cancer deaths. Another 10% are due to obesity, poor diet, lack of physical activity or excessive drinking of alcohol. Other factors include certain infections, exposure to ionizing radiation and environmental pollutants. In the developing world, 15% of cancers are due to infections such as Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, human papillomavirus infection, Epstein\u2013Barr virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). These factors act, at least partly, by changing the genes of a cell. Typically, many genetic changes are required before cancer develops. Approximately 5\u201310% of cancers are due to inherited genetic defects from a person's parents. Cancer can be detected by certain signs and symptoms or screening tests. It is then typically further investigated by medical imaging and confirmed by biopsy.Many cancers can be prevented by not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, not drinking too much alcohol, eating plenty of vegetables, fruits and whole grains, vaccination against certain infectious diseases, not eating too much processed and red meat and avoiding too much sunlight exposure. Early detection through screening is useful for cervical and colorectal cancer. The benefits of screening in breast cancer are controversial. Cancer is often treated with some combination of radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Pain and symptom management are an important part of care. Palliative care is particularly important in people with advanced disease. The chance of survival depends on the type of cancer and extent of disease at the start of treatment. In children under 15 at diagnosis, the five-year survival rate in the developed world is on average 80%. For cancer in the United States, the average five-year survival rate is 66%.In 2015, about 90.5 million people had cancer. About 14.1 million new cases occur a year (not including skin cancer other than melanoma). It caused about 8.8 million deaths (15.7% of deaths). The most common types of cancer in males are lung cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer and stomach cancer. In females, the most common types are breast cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer and cervical cancer. If skin cancer other than melanoma were included in total new cancer cases each year, it would account for around 40% of cases. In children, acute lymphoblastic leukemia and brain tumors are most common, except in Africa where non-Hodgkin lymphoma occurs more often. In 2012, about 165,000 children under 15 years of age were diagnosed with cancer. The risk of cancer increases significantly with age, and many cancers occur more commonly in developed countries. Rates are increasing as more people live to an old age and as lifestyle changes occur in the developing world. The financial costs of cancer were estimated at $1.16 trillion USD per year as of 2010.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.114","Capitalism","","Capitalism is an economic system based on the private ownership of the means of production and their operation for profit. Characteristics central to capitalism include private property, capital accumulation, wage labor, voluntary exchange, a price system and competitive markets. In a capitalist market economy, decision-making and investments are determined by every owner of wealth, property or production ability in financial and capital markets, whereas prices and the distribution of goods and services are mainly determined by competition in goods and services markets.Economists, political economists, sociologists and historians have adopted different perspectives in their analyses of capitalism and have recognized various forms of it in practice. These include laissez-faire or free-market capitalism, welfare capitalism and state capitalism. Different forms of capitalism feature varying degrees of free markets, public ownership, obstacles to free competition and state-sanctioned social policies. The degree of competition in markets, the role of intervention and regulation, and the scope of state ownership vary across different models of capitalism. The extent to which different markets are free as well as the rules defining private property are matters of politics and policy. Most existing capitalist economies are mixed economies which combine elements of free markets with state intervention and in some cases economic planning.Market economies have existed under many forms of government and in many different times, places and cultures. Modern capitalist societies\u2014marked by a universalization of money-based social relations, a consistently large and system-wide class of workers who must work for wages, and a capitalist class which owns the means of production\u2014developed in Western Europe in a process that led to the Industrial Revolution. Capitalist systems with varying degrees of direct government intervention have since become dominant in the Western world and continue to spread. Over time, capitalist countries have experienced consistent economic growth and an increase in the standard of living.\nCritics of capitalism argue that it establishes power in the hands of a minority capitalist class that exists through the exploitation of the majority working class and their labor; it prioritizes profit over social good, natural resources and the environment; and it is an engine of inequality, corruption and economic instabilities. Supporters argue that it provides better products and innovation through competition, disperses wealth to all productive people, promotes pluralism and decentralization of power, creates strong economic growth and yields productivity and prosperity that greatly benefit society.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.113","Capital punishment","","Capital punishment, also known as the death penalty, is a government-sanctioned practice whereby a person is put to death by the state as a punishment for a crime. The sentence ordering that someone be punished in such a manner is referred to as a death sentence, whereas the act of carrying out such a sentence is known as an execution. A prisoner who has been sentenced to death and is awaiting execution is referred to as condemned, and is said to be on death row. Crimes that are punishable by death are known as capital crimes, capital offences or capital felonies, and vary depending on the jurisdiction, but commonly include serious offences such as murder, mass murder, aggravated cases of rape, child rape, child sexual abuse, terrorism, treason, espionage, sedition, piracy, aircraft hijacking, drug trafficking and drug dealing, war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, and in some cases, the most serious acts of recidivism, aggravated robbery, and kidnapping.\nEtymologically, the term capital (lit. ""of the head"", derived via the Latin capitalis from caput, ""head"") in this context alluded to execution by beheading.Fifty-six countries retain capital punishment, 106 countries have completely abolished it de jure for all crimes, eight have abolished it for ordinary crimes (while maintaining it for special circumstances such as war crimes), and 28 are abolitionist in practice.Capital punishment is a matter of active controversy in several countries and states, and positions can vary within a single political ideology or cultural region. In the European Union, Article 2 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union prohibits the use of capital punishment. The Council of Europe, which has 47 member states, has sought to abolish the use of the death penalty by its members absolutely, through Protocol 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights. However, this only affects those member states which have signed and ratified it, and they do not include Armenia, Russia, and Azerbaijan.\nThe United Nations General Assembly has adopted, in 2007, 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2014, non-binding resolutions calling for a global moratorium on executions, with a view to eventual abolition. Although most nations have abolished capital punishment, over 60% of the world's population live in countries where the death penalty is retained, such as China, India, the United States, Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran, among almost all mostly Islamic countries, as is maintained in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Sri Lanka.  China is believed to execute more people than all other countries combined.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.115","Carl Jung","","Carl Gustav Jung ( YUUNG, German: [ka\u0281l \u02c8j\u028a\u014b]; 26 July 1875 \u2013 6 June 1961) was a Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who founded analytical psychology. Jung's work was influential in the fields of psychiatry, anthropology, archaeology, literature, philosophy, and religious studies. Jung worked as a research scientist at the famous Burgh\u00f6lzli hospital, under Eugen Bleuler. During this time, he came to the attention of Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis. The two men conducted a lengthy correspondence and collaborated, for a while, on a joint vision of human psychology.\nFreud saw the younger Jung as the heir he had been seeking to take forward his ""new science"" of psychoanalysis and to this end secured his appointment as President of his newly founded International Psychoanalytical Association. Jung's research and personal vision, however, made it impossible for him to bend to his older colleague's doctrine, and a schism became inevitable. This division was personally painful for Jung, and it was to have historic repercussions lasting well into the modern day.\nAmong the central concepts of analytical psychology is individuation\u2014the lifelong psychological process of differentiation of the self out of each individual's conscious and unconscious elements. Jung considered it to be the main task of human development. He created some of the best known psychological concepts, including synchronicity, archetypal phenomena, the collective unconscious, the psychological complex, and extraversion and introversion.\nJung was also an artist, craftsman and builder as well as a prolific writer. Many of his works were not published until after his death and some are still awaiting publication.","wikipedia","5.3"
"3.116","Catalonia","","Catalonia (; Catalan: Catalunya [k\u0259t\u0259\u02c8lu\u0272\u0259]; Aranese: Catalonha [kata\u02c8lu\u0272\u0254]; Spanish: Catalu\u00f1a [kata\u02c8lu\u0272a]) is an autonomous community on the northeastern corner of Spain, self-designated as a nationality by its Statute of Autonomy. Catalonia consists of four provinces: Barcelona, Girona, Lleida, and Tarragona. The capital and largest city is Barcelona, the second-most populated municipality in Spain and the core of the sixth most populous urban area in the European Union. It comprises most of the territory of the former Principality of Catalonia (with the remainder Roussillon now part of France's Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales, Occitanie). It is bordered by France (Occitanie) and Andorra to the north, the Mediterranean Sea to the east, and the Spanish autonomous communities of Aragon to the west and Valencia to the south. The official languages are Catalan, Spanish, and the Aranese dialect of Occitan.In the late 8th century, the counties of the March of Gothia and the Hispanic March were established by the Frankish kingdom as feudal vassals across and near the eastern Pyrenees as a defensive barrier against Muslim invasions. The eastern counties of these marches were united under the rule of the Frankish vassal, the count of Barcelona. In the 10th century the County of Barcelona became independent de facto. In 1137, Barcelona and the Kingdom of Aragon were united by marriage under the Crown of Aragon. The de jure end of Frankish rule was ratified by French and Aragonese monarchs in the Treaty of Corbeil in 1258. The Principality of Catalonia developed its own institutional system, such as courts (parliament), and constitutions, becoming the base for the Crown of Aragon's naval power, trade and expansionism in the Mediterranean. In the later Middle Ages, Catalan literature flourished. During the last Medieval centuries natural disasters, social turmoils and military conflicts affected the Principality. Between 1469 and 1516, the king of Aragon and the queen of Castile were married and ruled their realms together, retaining all of their distinct institutions and legislation.\nDuring the Franco-Spanish War (1635\u20131659), Catalonia revolted (1640\u20131652) against a large and burdensome presence of the royal army in its territory, being briefly proclaimed a republic under French protection. Within a brief period France took full control of Catalonia, until it was largely reconquered by the Spanish army. Under the terms of the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659, the Spanish Crown ceded the northern parts of Catalonia, mostly the County of Roussillon, to France. During the War of the Spanish Succession (1701\u20131714), the Crown of Aragon sided against the Bourbon Philip V of Spain; following Catalan defeat on 11 September 1714, Philip V, inspired by the model of France imposed a unifying administration across Spain, enacting the Nueva Planta decrees, suppressing the main Catalan institutions and rights like in the other realms of the Crown of Aragon. This led to the eclipse of Catalan as a language of government and literature, replaced by Spanish. Throughout the 18th century, Catalonia experienced economic growth, reinforced in the late quarter of the century when the Castile's trade monopoly with American colonies ended.\nIn the 19th century, Catalonia was severely affected by the Napoleonic and Carlist Wars. In the second third of the century, Catalonia experienced significant industrialisation. As wealth from the industrial expansion grew, Catalonia saw a cultural renaissance coupled with incipient nationalism while several workers movements appeared. In 1914, the four Catalan provinces formed a commonwealth, and with the return of democracy during the Second Spanish Republic (1931\u20131939), the Generalitat of Catalonia was restored as an autonomous government. After the Spanish Civil War, the Francoist dictatorship enacted repressive measures, abolishing Catalan self-government and banning the official use of the Catalan language again. After a first period of autarky, from the late 1950s through to the 1970s Catalonia saw rapid economic growth, drawing many workers from across Spain, making Barcelona one of Europe's largest industrial metropolitan areas and turning Catalonia into a major tourist destination. Since the Spanish transition to democracy (1975\u20131982), Catalonia has regained considerable autonomy in political, educational, environmental, and cultural affairs and is now one of the most economically dynamic communities of Spain. In the 2010s there has been growing support for Catalan independence. On 27 October 2017, the Catalan Parliament declared independence from Spain following a disputed referendum. The Spanish Senate voted in favour of enforcing direct rule by removing the entire Catalan government and calling a snap regional election for 21 December. On 2 November of the same year, the Spanish Supreme Court imprisoned seven former ministers of the Catalan government on charges of rebellion and misuse of public funds, while several others\u2014including then-President of Catalonia, Carles Puigdemont\u2014fled to other European countries (such as Belgium, in Puigdemont's case).\n\n","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.117","Catholicism","","The Catholic Church, sometimes referred to as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with approximately 1.3 billion baptised Catholics worldwide as of 2017. As the world's oldest and largest continuously functioning international institution, it has played a prominent role in the history and development of Western civilisation. The church is headed by the Bishop of Rome, known as the pope. Its central administration is the Holy See.\nThe Christian beliefs of Catholicism are found in the Nicene Creed. The Catholic Church teaches that it is the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic church founded by Jesus Christ in his Great Commission, that its bishops are the successors of Christ's apostles, and that the pope is the successor to Saint Peter upon whom primacy was conferred by Jesus Christ. It maintains that it practises the original Christian faith, reserving infallibility, passed down by sacred tradition. The Latin Church, the twenty-three Eastern Catholic Churches, and institutes such as mendicant orders, enclosed monastic orders and third orders reflect a variety of theological and spiritual emphases in the church.Of its seven sacraments the Eucharist is the principal one, celebrated liturgically in the Mass. The church teaches that through consecration by a priest the sacrificial bread and wine become the body and blood of Christ. The Virgin Mary is venerated in the Catholic Church as Mother of God and Queen of Heaven, honoured in dogmas and devotions. Its teaching includes Divine Mercy, sanctification through faith and evangelisation of the Gospel as well as Catholic social teaching, which emphasises voluntary support for the sick, the poor, and the afflicted through the corporal and spiritual works of mercy. The Catholic Church is the largest non-government provider of education and health care in the world.The Catholic Church has influenced Western philosophy, culture, art, and science. Catholics live all over the world through missions, diaspora, and conversions. Since the 20th century the majority reside in the southern hemisphere due to secularisation in Europe, and increased persecution in the Middle East.\nThe Catholic Church shared communion with the Eastern Orthodox Church until the East\u2013West Schism in 1054, disputing particularly the authority of the pope. Before the Council of Ephesus in AD 431 the Church of the East also shared in this communion, as did the Oriental Orthodox churches before the Council of Chalcedon in AD 451, all separating primarily over differences in Christology.  In the 16th century, the Reformation and Counter Reformation led to further divisions with historic consequences.  \nFrom the late 20th century, the Catholic Church has received criticism from some for its teaching on sexuality, its inability to ordain women, as well as the handling of sexual abuse cases involving clergy.","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.108","CCTV","","Closed-circuit television (CCTV), also known as video surveillance, is the use of video cameras to transmit a signal to a specific place, on a limited set of monitors. It differs from broadcast television in that the signal is not openly transmitted, though it may employ point-to-point (P2P), point-to-multipoint (P2MP), or mesh wired or wireless links.  Though almost all video cameras fit this definition, the term is most often applied to those used for surveillance in areas that may need monitoring such as banks, stores, and other areas where security is needed. Though videotelephony is seldom called 'CCTV' one exception is the use of video in distance education, where it is an important tool.Surveillance of the public using CCTV is common in many areas around the world. In recent years, the use of body worn video cameras has been introduced as a new form of surveillance, often used in law enforcement, with cameras located on a police officer's chest or head.  Video surveillance has generated significant debate about balancing its use with individuals' right to privacy even when in public.In industrial plants, CCTV equipment may be used to observe parts of a process from a central control room, for example when the environment is not suitable for humans. CCTV systems may operate continuously or only as required to monitor a particular event. A more advanced form of CCTV, utilizing digital video recorders (DVRs), provides recording for possibly many years, with a variety of quality and performance options and extra features (such as motion detection and email alerts). More recently, decentralized IP cameras, perhaps equipped with megapixel sensors, support recording directly to network-attached storage devices, or internal flash for completely stand-alone operation.\nThere are about 350 million surveillance cameras worldwide as of 2016. About 65% of these cameras are installed in Asia. The growth of CCTV has been slowing in recent years.  The deployment of this technology has facilitated a significant growth in state surveillance, a substantial rise in the methods of advanced social monitoring and control, and a host of crime prevention measures throughout the world.","wikipedia","5.13"
"3.118","Celtic Revival","","The Celtic Revival (also referred to as the Celtic Twilight or Celtomania) was a variety of movements and trends in the 19th and 20th centuries that saw a renewed interest in aspects of Celtic culture.  Artists and writers drew on the traditions of Gaelic literature, Welsh-language literature, and so-called 'Celtic art'\u2014what historians call Insular art (the Early Medieval style of Ireland and Britain). Although the revival was complex and multifaceted, occurring across many fields and in various countries in Northwest Europe, its best known incarnation is probably the Irish Literary Revival. Irish writers including William Butler Yeats, Lady Gregory, ""AE"" Russell, Edward Martyn, and Edward Plunkett (Lord Dunsany) stimulated a new appreciation of traditional Irish literature and Irish poetry in the late 19th and early 20th century.\n\nIn aspects the revival came to represent a reaction to modernisation. This is particularly true in Ireland, where the relationship between the archaic and the modern was antagonistic, where history was fractured, and where, according to Terry Eagleton, ""as a whole [the nation] had not leapt at a bound from tradition to modernity"". At times this romantic view of the past resulted in historically inaccurate portrayals, such as the promotion of noble savage stereotypes of the Irish people and Scottish Highlanders, as well as a racialized view that referred to the Irish, whether positively or negatively, as a separate race.A widespread and still visible result of the revival was the reintroduction of the High cross as the Celtic cross, which now forms a familiar part of monumental and funerary art over much of the Western world.","wikipedia","5.10"
"3.119","Censorship","","Censorship is the suppression of speech, public communication, or other information, on the basis that such material is considered objectionable, harmful, sensitive, or ""inconvenient."" Censorship can be conducted by governments,  private institutions, and corporations.\nGovernments and private organizations may engage in censorship. Other groups or institutions may propose and petition for censorship. When an individual such as an author or other creator engages in censorship of their own works or speech, it is referred to as self-censorship.   It occurs in a variety of different media, including speech, books, music, films, and other arts, the press, radio, television, and the Internet for a variety of claimed reasons including national security, to control obscenity, child pornography, and hate speech, to protect children or other vulnerable groups, to promote or restrict political or religious views, and to prevent slander and libel.\n\nDirect censorship may or may not be legal, depending on the type, location, and content. Many countries provide strong protections against censorship by law, but none of these protections are absolute and frequently a claim of necessity to balance conflicting rights is made, in order to determine what could and could not be censored. There are no laws against self-censorship.","wikipedia","5.13"
"3.120","Centre Party Germany","","The German Centre Party (German: Deutsche Zentrumspartei or just Zentrum) is a lay Catholic political party in Germany, primarily influential during the Kaiserreich and the Weimar Republic. In English it is often called the Catholic Centre Party. Formed in 1870, it successfully battled the Kulturkampf which Chancellor Otto von Bismarck launched in Prussia to reduce the power of the Catholic Church. It soon won a quarter of the seats in the Reichstag (Imperial Parliament), and its middle position on most issues allowed it to play a decisive role in the formation of majorities.In the early days of the Weimar Republic, the Centre Party was the second-largest party in the Reichstag.  After the Reichstag Fire in early 1933, the Centre Party was one of the ones who voted for the Enabling Act, which granted dictatorial powers to Adolf Hitler.  By this vote, the Centre Party effectively destroyed itself, as the Nazi Party became the only legally permitted party in the country shortly thereafter.\nAfter World War II, the party was refounded, but could not rise again to its former importance, as most of its members joined the new Christian Democratic Union (CDU). The Centre Party was represented in the German parliament until 1957. It exists as a marginal party, mainly based in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia.\n\n","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.121","Chakra","","Chakras (Sanskrit: \u091a\u0915\u094d\u0930, IAST: cakra, Pali: cakka, lit. wheel, circle; English:  CHUK-, CHAK-r\u0259) are the various focal points in the subtle body used in a variety of ancient meditation practices, collectively denominated as Tantra, or the esoteric or inner traditions of Hinduism.The concept is found in the early traditions of Hinduism. Beliefs differ between the Indian religions, with many Buddhist texts consistently mentioning five chakras, while Hindu sources offer six or even seven. Early Sanskrit texts speak of them both as meditative visualizations combining flowers and mantras and as physical entities in the body. Some modern interpreters speak of them as complexes of electromagnetic variety, the precise degree and variety of which directly arise from a synthetic average of all positive and negative so-called ""fields"", thus eventuating the complex Nadi. Within kundalini yoga, the techniques of breath exercises, visualizations, mudras, bandhas, kriyas, and mantras are focused on manipulating the flow of subtle energy through chakras.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.122","Chernobyl","","Chernobyl ( chur-NOH-b\u0259l,  UK:  chur-NOB-\u0259l) or Chornobyl (Ukrainian: \u0427\u043e\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u044c, romanized: Chornobyl') is a ghost city in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, situated in the Ivankiv Raion of northern Kiev Oblast, Ukraine. Chernobyl is about 90 kilometres (60 mi) north of Kiev, and 160 kilometres (100 mi) southwest of the Belarusian city of Gomel. Before its evacuation, the city had about 14,000 residents.The city was evacuated on 5 May 1986, 9 days after the nuclear accident at the nearby Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, which was the most disastrous nuclear accident in history. The plant is 15 kilometres (9 mi) north of the Chernobyl city. Pripyat is a city much closer to the plant; it was built in the 1970s as a home for the power-plant's workers, and its population of 50,000 was evacuated 30 hours after the accident. The city of Slavutych, built for those evacuated from Pripyat, also received the population evacuated from Chernobyl.\nThe city was the administrative center of Chernobyl Raion (district) from 1923. After the accident, in 1988, the raion was disestablished and administration was transferred to the neighboring Ivankiv Raion.\nAlthough Chernobyl is mostly a ghost town today, a small number of animals and people still live there, in houses marked with signs that read, ""Owner of this house lives here"". Workers on watch and administrative personnel of the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone are also stationed in the city. There are two general stores, and a tourist hotel.","wikipedia","5.9"
"3.123","Cherokee","","The Cherokee (; Cherokee: \u13a0\u13c2\u13f4\u13eb\u13ef\u13a2, romanized: Aniyvwiya\u0294i, or Cherokee: \u13e3\u13b3\u13a9, romanized: Tsalagi) are one of the indigenous people of the Southeastern Woodlands of the United States. Prior to the 18th century, they were concentrated in what is now southwestern North Carolina, southeastern Tennessee, edges of western South Carolina, northeastern Georgia and northeastern Alabama.The Cherokee language is part of the Iroquoian language group. In the 19th century, James Mooney, an American ethnographer, recorded one oral tradition that told of the tribe having migrated south in ancient times from the Great Lakes region, where other Iroquoian-speaking peoples lived; however, anthropologist Thomas R. Whyte writes that the origin of the proto-Iroquoian language was likely the Appalachian region and the split between Northern and Southern Iroquoian languages began 4,000 years ago.By the 19th century, European settlers in the United States classified the Cherokee of the Southeast as one of the ""Five Civilized Tribes"", because they were agrarian and lived in permanent villages and began to adopt some cultural and technological practices of the European American settlers.\nToday there are three federally recognized Cherokee tribes: the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians in North Carolina, the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians (UKB) in Oklahoma, and the Cherokee Nation (CN) in Oklahoma.The Cherokee Nation has more than 300,000 tribal members, making it the largest of the 567 federally recognized tribes in the United States. In addition, numerous groups claim Cherokee lineage, and some of these are state-recognized. A total of more than 819,000 people are estimated to claim having Cherokee ancestry on the US census, which includes persons who are not enrolled members of any tribe.Of the three federally recognized Cherokee tribes, the Cherokee Nation and the UKB have headquarters in Tahlequah, Oklahoma. The UKB are mostly descendants of ""Old Settlers"", Cherokee who migrated to Arkansas and Oklahoma about 1817 prior to Indian Removal. They are related to the Cherokee who were later forcibly relocated there in the 1830s under the Indian Removal Act. The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians is on the Qualla Boundary in western North Carolina; their ancestors resisted or avoided relocation, remaining in the area.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.124","Chicano nationalism","","Chicano nationalism is the pro-indigenist ethnic nationalist ideology of Chicanos. While there were nationalistic aspects of the Chicano Movement of the 1960s and 1970s, the Movement tended to emphasize civil rights and political and social inclusion rather than nationalism. For this reason, Chicano nationalism is better described as an ideology than as a political movement.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.125","Child grooming","","Child grooming is befriending and establishing an emotional connection with a child, and sometimes the family, to lower the child's inhibitions with the objective of sexual abuse.  Child grooming is also regularly used to lure minors into various illicit businesses such as  child trafficking, child prostitution, or the production of child pornography.This crime has been proscribed in various ways since the International Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Women and Children, which was agreed in 1921 as a multilateral treaty of the League of Nations that addressed the problem of international trafficking of women and children for nefarious purposes. The proscribed traffic was international in nature at that time. The concept of localised grooming, in which gangs groom neighbourhood victims, was defined in 2010 by the UK Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre.","wikipedia","5.7"
"3.126","Child sexuality","","Development of sexuality is an integral part of the development and maturation of children. A range of sensational, emotional and consequent sexual activities that may occur before or during early puberty, but before full sexual maturity is established. The development of child sexuality is influenced by social and cultural aspects; the perception of developing child sexuality is even more heavily influenced by cultural aspects. The concept of child sexuality also played an important role in the classical psychoanalysis.\n\n","wikipedia","5.7"
"3.127","Chinese intelligence activity abroad","","The government of China is engaged in espionage overseas, directed through diverse methods via the Ministry of State Security, the United Front Work Department, and People's Liberation Army intelligence as well as their various front organizations. It is employs a variety of tactics including cyber spying to gain access to sensitive information remotely, Signals intelligence (SIGINT), Electronic intelligence (ELINT) and Human agents (HUMINT). China is also engaged in industrial espionage aimed at gathering information to bolster its economy, as well as monitoring dissidents abroad such as supporters of the Tibetan independence movement, Uyghurs, the Taiwan independence movement, Falun Gong, and democracy activists.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.128","Chinese language","","Chinese (simplified Chinese: \u6c49\u8bed; traditional Chinese: \u6f22\u8a9e; pinyin: H\u00e0ny\u01d4; literally: 'Han language'; or especially though not exclusively for written Chinese: \u4e2d\u6587; Zh\u014dngw\u00e9n; 'Chinese writing') is a group of languages that forms the Sinitic branch of the Sino-Tibetan languages. Chinese languages are spoken by the ethnic Chinese majority and many minority ethnic groups in China. About 1.2 billion people (around 16% of the world's population) speak some form of Chinese as their first language. \nThe varieties of Chinese are usually considered by native speakers to be regional variants of ethnic Chinese speech, without consideration of whether they are mutually intelligible. Due to their lack of mutual intelligibility, linguists generally describe them as distinct languages, perhaps hundreds, sometimes noting that they are more varied than the Romance languages. Investigation of the historical relationships among the Sinitic languages is just getting started. Currently, most classifications posit 7 to 13 main regional groups, based on often superficial phonetic developments, of which the most populous by far is Mandarin (about 800 million speakers, e.g. Southwestern Mandarin), followed by Min (75 million, e.g. Southern Min), Wu (74 million, e.g. Shanghainese), Yue (68 million, e.g. Cantonese). These groups are unintelligible to each other, and generally many of their subgroups are mutually unintelligible as well (e.g., not only is Min Chinese a family of mutually unintelligible languages, but Southern Min itself is not a single language). There are, however, several transitional areas, where languages and dialects from different branches share enough features for some limited intelligibility between neighboring areas. Examples are New Xiang and Southwest Mandarin, Xuanzhou Wu and Lower Yangtze Mandarin, Jin and Central Plains Mandarin, and certain divergent dialects of Hakka with Gan (though these are unintelligible with mainstream Hakka). All varieties of Chinese are tonal to at least some degree and largely analytic.\nStandard Chinese (P\u01d4t\u014dnghu\u00e0/Gu\u00f3y\u01d4/Hu\u00e1y\u01d4) is a standardized form of spoken Chinese based on the Beijing dialect of Mandarin. It is an official language of China, similar to one of the national languages of Taiwan (Taiwanese Mandarin) and one of the four official languages of Singapore. It is one of the six official languages of the United Nations. The written form of the standard language (\u4e2d\u6587; Zh\u014dngw\u00e9n), based on the logograms known as Chinese characters (\u6c49\u5b57/\u6f22\u5b57; H\u00e0nz\u00ec), is shared by literate speakers of otherwise unintelligible dialects.\nThe earliest Chinese written records are Shang dynasty-era oracle inscriptions, which can be traced back to 1250 BCE. The phonetic categories of Archaic Chinese can be reconstructed from the rhymes of ancient poetry. During the Northern and Southern dynasties period, Middle Chinese went through several sound changes and split into several varieties following prolonged geographic and political separation. Qieyun, a rime dictionary, recorded a compromise between the pronunciations of different regions. The royal courts of the Ming and early Qing dynasties operated using a koin\u00e9 language (Guanhua) based on Nanjing dialect of Lower Yangtze Mandarin. Standard Chinese was adopted in the 1930s, and is now an official language of both the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China on Taiwan.","wikipedia","5.10"
"3.129","Chinese television","","The television industry in China includes high-tech program production, transmission and coverage. China Central Television is China's largest and most powerful national television station. By 1987, two-thirds of people in China had access to television, while today, over 3,000 channels are available in the country.\nChinese television drama has also proven to be a hot spot in today's popular culture (similar to K-dramas), with well received Chinese television dramas such as Princess Agents, Nirvana in Fire, The Journey of Flower, Eternal Love, The Princess Weiyoung, Just One Smile Is Very Alluring, The Legend of Mi Yue, Scarlet Heart, General and I and more garnering billions of views among China's most popular video websites, iQiyi, Youku, Tencent Video and Le Video. Some dramas have been so popular and widely acclaimed that they were remade into different languages, as well as spinning off with a sequel.\nChinese variety scene has also became widely successful with popular shows such as Happy Camp, Super Girl, Sing!

"3.130","Chiropractic","","Chiropractic is a pseudoscientific complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) that is concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of mechanical disorders of the musculoskeletal system, especially the spine. Chiropractors have proposed, especially those in the field's early history, that such disorders affect general health via the nervous system. The main chiropractic treatment technique involves manual therapy, especially manipulation of the spine, other joints, and soft tissues, but may also include exercises and health and lifestyle counseling. Chiropractors are not physicians or medical doctors.Systematic reviews of controlled clinical studies of treatments used by chiropractors have not found evidence that chiropractic manipulation is effective, with the possible exception of treatment for back pain. A critical evaluation found that collectively, spinal manipulation was ineffective at treating any condition. Spinal manipulation may be cost-effective for sub-acute or chronic low back pain but the results for acute low back pain were insufficient. The efficacy and cost-effectiveness of maintenance chiropractic care are unknown. There is not sufficient data to establish the safety of chiropractic manipulations. It is frequently associated with mild to moderate adverse effects, with serious or fatal complications in rare cases. There is controversy regarding the degree of risk of vertebral artery dissection, which can lead to stroke and death, from cervical manipulation. Several deaths have been associated with this technique and it has been suggested that the relationship is causative, a claim which is disputed by many chiropractors.Chiropractic is well established in the United States, Canada, and Australia. It overlaps with other manual-therapy professions such as osteopathy and physical therapy. Most who seek chiropractic care do so for low back pain. Back and neck pain are considered the specialties of chiropractic, but many chiropractors treat ailments other than musculoskeletal issues. Many chiropractors describe themselves as primary care providers, but the chiropractic clinical training does not support the requirements to be considered primary care providers. Chiropractic has two main groups: ""straights"", now the minority, emphasize vitalism, ""innate intelligence"", and consider vertebral subluxations to be the cause of all disease; ""mixers"", the majority, are more open to mainstream views and conventional medical techniques, such as exercise, massage, and ice therapy.D. D. Palmer founded chiropractic in the 1890s, after saying he received it from ""the other world""; Palmer maintained that the tenets of chiropractic were passed along to him by a doctor who had died 50 years previously. His son B. J. Palmer helped to expand Chiropractic in the early 20th century. Throughout its history, chiropractic has been controversial. Its foundation is at odds with mainstream medicine, and has been sustained by pseudoscientific ideas such as subluxation and innate intelligence. Despite the overwhelming evidence that vaccination is an effective public health intervention, among chiropractors there are significant disagreements over the subject, which has led to negative impacts on both public vaccination and mainstream acceptance of chiropractic. The American Medical Association called chiropractic an ""unscientific cult"" in 1966 and boycotted it until losing an antitrust case in 1987. Chiropractic has had a strong political base and sustained demand for services; in recent decades, it has gained more legitimacy and greater acceptance among conventional physicians and health plans in the United States.","wikipedia","5.8"

"3.134","Christianity","","Christianity is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth. Its adherents, known as Christians, believe that Jesus is the Christ, whose coming as the messiah was prophesied in the Hebrew Bible, called the Old Testament in Christianity, and chronicled in the New Testament. It is the world's largest religion with about 2.4 billion followers.Christianity began as a Second Temple Judaic sect in the 1st century in the Roman province of Judea. Jesus' apostles and their followers spread around Syria, the Levant, Europe, Anatolia, Mesopotamia, Transcaucasia, Egypt, and Ethiopia, despite initial persecution. It soon attracted gentile God-fearers, which led to a departure from Jewish customs, and, after the Fall of Jerusalem, AD 70 which ended the Temple-based Judaism, Christianity slowly separated from Judaism. Emperor Constantine the Great decriminalized Christianity in the Roman Empire by the Edict of Milan (313), later convening the Council of Nicaea (325) where Early Christianity was consolidated into what would become the State church of the Roman Empire (380). Constantine converted to Christianity before his death (337). The early history of Christianity's united church before major schisms is sometimes referred to as the ""Great Church"". The Church of the East split after the Council of Ephesus (431) and Oriental Orthodoxy split after the Council of Chalcedon (451) over differences in Christology, while the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church separated in the East\u2013West Schism (1054), especially over the authority of the bishop of Rome. Similarly, Protestantism split in numerous denominations from the Latin Catholic Church in the Reformation era (16th century) over theological and ecclesiological disputes, most predominantly on the issue of justification and the primacy of the bishop of Rome. Following the Age of Discovery (15th\u201317th century), Christianity was spread into the Americas, Oceania, sub-Saharan Africa, and the rest of the world via missionary work.Christianity remains culturally diverse in its Western and Eastern branches, as well as in its doctrines concerning justification and the nature of salvation, ecclesiology, ordination, and Christology. The four largest branches of Christianity are the Catholic Church (1.3 billion/50.1%), Protestantism (920 million/36.7%), the Eastern Orthodox Church (260 million) and Oriental Orthodoxy (86 million/both together 11.9%), amid various efforts toward unity (ecumenism). Their creeds generally hold in common Jesus as the Son of God\u2014the logos incarnated\u2014who ministered, suffered, and died on a cross, but rose from the dead for the salvation of mankind; as referred to as the gospel, meaning the ""good news"", in the Bible (scripture). Describing Jesus' life and teachings are the four canonical gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John with the Jewish Old Testament as the gospel's respected background.\nChristianity and Christian ethics played a prominent role in the development of Western civilization, particularly around Europe from late antiquity and the Middle Ages. Despite a decline in adherence in the West, Christianity remains the dominant religion in the region, with about 70% of the population identifying as Christian. Christianity is growing in Africa and Asia, the world's most populous continents. Christians are the most persecuted religious group in the world, especially in the Middle-East, North Africa and South Asia.","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.133","Christian right","","The Christian right or the religious right are Christian political factions that are characterized by their strong support of socially conservative policies. Christian conservatives seek to influence politics and public policy with their interpretation of the teachings of Christianity.In the United States, the Christian right is an informal coalition formed around a core of conservative evangelical Protestants and Roman Catholics. The Christian right draws additional support from politically conservative mainline Protestants and members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. The movement has its roots in American politics going back as far as the 1940s and has been especially influential since the 1970s. Its influence draws from grassroots activism as well as from focus on social issues and the ability to motivate the electorate around those issues.The Christian right is notable for advancing socially conservative positions on issues including school prayer, intelligent design, embryonic stem cell research, homosexuality, euthanasia, contraception, sex education, abortion, and pornography. Although the term Christian right is most commonly associated with politics in the United States, similar Christian conservative groups can be found in the political cultures of other Christian-majority nations.","wikipedia","['5.5','5.1']"
"3.132","Christian Science","","Christian Science is a set of beliefs and practices belonging to the metaphysical family of new religious movements. It was developed in 19th-century New England by Mary Baker Eddy, who argued in her 1875 book Science and Health that sickness is an illusion that can be corrected by prayer alone. The book became Christian Science's central text, along with the Bible, and by 2001 had sold over nine million copies.Eddy and 26 followers were granted a charter in 1879 to found the Church of Christ, Scientist, and in 1894 the Mother Church, The First Church of Christ, Scientist, was built in Boston, Massachusetts. Christian Science became the fastest growing religion in the United States, with nearly 270,000 members there by 1936, a figure that had declined by 1990 to just over 100,000, and by 2009 reportedly to under 50,000. The church is known for its newspaper, The Christian Science Monitor, which won seven Pulitzer Prizes between 1950 and 2002, and for its public Reading Rooms around the world.Eddy described Christian Science as a return to ""primitive Christianity and its lost element of healing"". There are key differences between Christian Science theology and that of traditional Christianity. In particular, adherents subscribe to a radical form of philosophical idealism, believing that reality is purely spiritual and the material world an illusion. This includes the view that disease is a mental error rather than physical disorder, and that the sick should be treated not by medicine but by a form of prayer that seeks to correct the beliefs responsible for the illusion of ill health.The church does not require that Christian Scientists avoid all medical care\u2014adherents use dentists, optometrists, obstetricians, physicians for broken bones, and vaccination when required by law\u2014but maintains that Christian-Science prayer is most effective when not combined with medicine. Between the 1880s and 1990s, the avoidance of medical treatment led to the deaths of several adherents and their children. Parents and others were prosecuted for, and in a few cases convicted of, manslaughter or neglect.","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.135","Christophobia","","The persecution of Christians can be historically traced from the first century of the Christian era to the present day. Early Christians were persecuted for their faith at the hands of both the Jews from whose religion Christianity arose and the Romans who controlled many of the lands across which early Christianity was spread. Early in the fourth century, a form of the religion was legalized by the Edict of Milan, and it eventually became the State church of the Roman Empire.\nChristian missionaries as well as converts to Christianity have been the target of persecution ever since the emergence of Christianity, sometimes to the point of being martyred for their faith.\nThe schisms of the Middle Ages and especially the Protestant Reformation, sometimes provoked severe conflicts between Christian denominations to the point of persecuting each other.\nIn the 20th century, Christians were persecuted by various governments including the Ottoman Empire in the form of the Armenian Genocide, the Assyrian Genocide and the Greek Genocide, as well as by atheistic states such as the Soviet Union, Communist Albania  and North Korea.","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.136","Chromosome","","A chromosome is a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecule with part or all of the genetic material (genome) of an organism. Most eukaryotic chromosomes include packaging proteins which, aided by chaperone proteins, bind to and condense the DNA molecule to prevent it from becoming an unmanageable tangle. This three-dimensional genome structure plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation.Chromosomes are normally visible under a light microscope only when the cell is undergoing the metaphase of cell division (where all chromosomes are aligned in the center of the cell in their condensed form). Before this happens, every chromosome is copied once (S phase), and the copy is joined to the original by a centromere, resulting either in an X-shaped structure (pictured here) if the centromere is located in the middle of the chromosome or a two-arm structure if the centromere is located near one of the ends. The original chromosome and the copy are now called sister chromatids. During metaphase the X-shape structure is called a metaphase chromosome. In this highly condensed form chromosomes are easiest to distinguish and study. In animal cells, chromosomes reach their highest compaction level in anaphase during chromosome segregation.Chromosomal recombination during meiosis and subsequent sexual reproduction play a significant role in genetic diversity. If these structures are manipulated incorrectly, through processes known as chromosomal instability and translocation, the cell may undergo mitotic catastrophe. Usually, this will make the cell initiate apoptosis leading to its own death, but sometimes mutations in the cell hamper this process and thus cause progression of cancer.\nSome use the term chromosome in a wider sense, to refer to the individualized portions of chromatin in cells, either visible or not under light microscopy. Others use the concept in a narrower sense, to refer to the individualized portions of chromatin during cell division, visible under light microscopy due to high condensation.\n\n","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.137","Circumcision","","Circumcision is the removal of the foreskin from the human penis. In the most common procedure, the foreskin is opened, adhesions are removed, and the foreskin is separated from the glans. After that, a circumcision device may be placed, and then the foreskin is cut off. Topical or locally injected anesthesia is used to reduce pain and physiologic stress. The procedure is most often an elective surgery performed on babies and children for religious or cultural reasons.  Medically, circumcision is a treatment option for problematic cases of phimosis and balanoposthitis that do not resolve with other treatments, and for chronic urinary tract infections (UTIs). It is contraindicated in cases of certain genital structure abnormalities or poor general health.The positions of the world's major medical organizations range from a belief that elective circumcision of babies and children carries significant risks and offers no medical benefits to a belief that the procedure has a modest health benefit that outweighs small risks. No major medical organization recommends circumcising all males, and no major medical organization recommends banning the procedure. Ethical and legal questions regarding informed consent and human rights have been raised over the circumcision of babies and children for non-medical reasons; for these reasons, the procedure is controversial.Male circumcision reduces the risk of HIV infection among heterosexual men in sub-Saharan Africa. Consequently, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends consideration of circumcision as part of a comprehensive HIV prevention program in areas with high rates of HIV. The effectiveness of using circumcision to prevent HIV in the developed world is unclear; however, there is some evidence that circumcision reduces HIV infection risk for men who have sex with men. Circumcision is also associated with reduced rates of cancer-causing forms of human papillomavirus (HPV), UTIs, and cancer of the penis. Prevention of these conditions is not seen as a justification for routine circumcision of infants in the Western world. Studies of other sexually transmitted infections also suggest that circumcision is protective, including for men who have sex with men. A 2010 review found circumcisions performed by medical providers to have a typical complication rate of 1.5% for babies and 6% for older children, with few cases of severe complications. Bleeding, infection, and the removal of either too much or too little foreskin are the most common complications cited. Complication rates are higher when the procedure is performed by an inexperienced operator, in unsterile conditions, or in older children. Circumcision does not appear to have a negative impact on sexual function.An estimated one-third of males worldwide are circumcised. Circumcision is most common among Muslims and Jews (among whom it is near-universal for religious reasons), and in the United States, parts of Southeast Asia, and Africa. It is relatively rare for non-religious reasons in Europe, Latin America, parts of Southern Africa, and most of Asia. The origin of circumcision is not known with certainty; the oldest documented evidence for it comes from ancient Egypt. Various theories have been proposed as to its origin including as a religious sacrifice and as a rite of passage marking a boy's entrance into adulthood. It is part of religious law in Judaism and is an established practice in Islam, Coptic Christianity, and the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. The word circumcision is from Latin circumcidere, meaning ""to cut around"".","wikipedia","['5.8','5.7']"
"3.138","Clinical depression","","Major depressive disorder (MDD), also known simply as depression, is a mental disorder characterized by at least two weeks of low mood that is present across most situations. It is often accompanied by low self-esteem, loss of interest in normally enjoyable activities, low energy, and pain without a clear cause. People may also occasionally have false beliefs or see or hear things that others cannot. Some people have periods of depression separated by years in which they are normal, while others nearly always have symptoms present. Major depressive disorder can negatively affect a person's personal life, work life, or education, as well as sleeping, eating habits, and general health. About 2\u20138% of adults with major depression die by suicide, and about 50% of people who die by suicide had depression or another mood disorder.The cause is believed to be a combination of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors. Risk factors include a family history of the condition, major life changes, certain medications, chronic health problems, and substance abuse. About 40% of the risk appears to be related to genetics. The diagnosis of major depressive disorder is based on the person's reported experiences and a mental status examination. There is no laboratory test for major depression. Testing, however, may be done to rule out physical conditions that can cause similar symptoms. Major depression is more severe and lasts longer than sadness, which is a normal part of life. The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening for depression among those over the age 12, while a prior Cochrane review found that the routine use of screening questionnaires has little effect on detection or treatment.Typically, people are treated with counseling and antidepressant medication. Medication appears to be effective, but the effect may only be significant in the most severely depressed. It is unclear whether medications affect the risk of suicide. Types of counseling used include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy. If other measures are not effective, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be considered. Hospitalization may be necessary in cases with a risk of harm to self and may occasionally occur against a person's wishes.Major depressive disorder affected approximately 216 million people (3% of the world's population) in 2015. The percentage of people who are affected at one point in their life varies from 7% in Japan to 21% in France. Lifetime rates are higher in the developed world (15%) compared to the developing world (11%). It causes the second-most years lived with disability, after lower back pain. The most common time of onset is in a person's 20s and 30s. Females are affected about twice as often as males. The American Psychiatric Association added ""major depressive disorder"" to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III) in 1980. It was a split of the previous depressive neurosis in the DSM-II, which also encompassed the conditions now known as dysthymia and adjustment disorder with depressed mood. Those currently or previously affected may be stigmatized.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.139","Cloning","","Cloning is the process of producing genetically identical individuals of an organism either naturally or artificially. In nature, many organisms produce clones through asexual reproduction. Cloning in biotechnology refers to the process of creating clones of organisms or copies of cells or DNA fragments (molecular cloning). Beyond biology, the term refers to the production of multiple copies of digital media or software\nThe term clone, coined by Herbert J. Webber, is derived from the Ancient Greek word \u03ba\u03bb\u03ce\u03bd kl\u014dn, ""twig"", referring to the process whereby a new plant can be created from a twig. In botany, the term lusus was traditionally used. In horticulture, the spelling clon was used until the twentieth century; the final e came into use to indicate the vowel is a ""long o"" instead of a ""short o"". Since the term entered the popular lexicon in a more general context, the spelling clone has been used exclusively.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.109","CNN","","CNN (Cable News Network) is an American news-based pay television channel owned by AT&T's WarnerMedia. CNN was founded in 1980 by American media proprietor Ted Turner as a 24-hour cable news channel. Upon its launch in 1980, CNN was the first television channel to provide 24-hour news coverage and was the first all-news television channel in the United States.While the news channel has numerous affiliates, CNN primarily broadcasts from 30 Hudson Yards in New York City, and studios in Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles. Its headquarters at the CNN Center in Atlanta is only used for weekend programming. CNN is sometimes referred to as CNN/U.S. (or CNN Domestic) to distinguish the U.S. channel from its international sister network, CNN International.\nThe network is known for its dramatic live coverage of breaking news, some of which has drawn criticism as overly sensationalistic, and for its efforts to be nonpartisan, which have led to accusations of false balance.As of September 2018, CNN has 90.1 million television households as subscribers (97.7% of households with cable) in the United States. In 2019, CNN ranked third in viewership among cable news networks, behind rivals Fox News and MSNBC, averaging 972,000 viewers. CNN ranks 14th among all basic cable networks.Globally, CNN programming airs through CNN International, which can be seen by viewers in over 212 countries and territories.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.140","Coal","","Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock, formed as rock strata called coal seams. Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements; chiefly hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen.\nCoal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years. Vast deposits of coal originate in former wetlands\u2014called coal forests\u2014that covered much of the Earth's tropical land areas during the late Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian) and Permian times.As a fossil fuel burned for heat, coal supplies about a quarter of the world's primary energy and two-fifths of its electricity. Some iron and steel making and other industrial processes burn coal.\nThe extraction and use of coal causes many premature deaths and much illness. The coal industry damages the environment, including by climate change as it is the largest anthropogenic source of carbon dioxide, 14 gigatonne (Gt) in 2016, which is 40% of the total fossil fuel emissions and almost 25% of total global greenhouse gas emissions. As part of the worldwide energy transition many countries have stopped using or use less coal, and the UN Secretary General has asked governments to stop building new coal plants by 2020. To meet the Paris Agreement target of keeping global warming to well below 2 \u00b0C (3.6 \u00b0F) coal use needs to halve from 2020 to 2030.The largest consumer and importer of coal is China. China mines almost half the world's coal, followed by India with about a tenth. Australia accounts for about a third of world coal exports followed by Indonesia and Russia.","wikipedia","5.9"
"3.141","Coandă-1910","","The Coand\u0103-1910, designed by Romanian inventor Henri Coand\u0103, was an unconventional sesquiplane aircraft powered by a ducted fan. Called the ""turbo-propulseur"" by Coand\u0103, its experimental engine consisted of a conventional piston engine driving a multi-bladed centrifugal blower which exhausted into a duct. The unusual aircraft attracted attention at the Second International Aeronautical Exhibition in Paris in October 1910, being the only exhibit without a propeller, but the aircraft was not displayed afterwards and it fell from public awareness. Coand\u0103 used a similar turbo-propulseur to drive a snow sledge, but he did not develop it further for aircraft.\nDecades later, after the practical demonstration of motorjets and turbojets, Coand\u0103 began to tell various conflicting stories about how his early experiments were precursors to the jet, even that his turbo-propulseur was the first motorjet engine with fuel combustion in the airstream. He also claimed to have made a single brief flight in December 1910, crashing just after takeoff, the aircraft being destroyed by fire. Two aviation historians countered Coand\u0103's version of events, saying there was no proof that the engine had combustion in the airstream, and no proof that the aircraft ever flew. In 1965, Coand\u0103 brought drawings forward to prove his claim of combustion ducting but these were shown to be reworked, differing substantially from the originals. Many aviation historians were dismissive, saying that Coand\u0103's turbo-propulseur design involved a weak stream of ""plain air"", not a powerful jet of air expanding from fuel combustion.In 2010, based on the notion that Coand\u0103 invented the first jet, the centennial of the jet aircraft was celebrated in Romania. A special coin and stamp were issued, and construction began on a working replica of the aircraft. At the European Parliament, an exhibition commemorated the building and testing of the Coand\u0103-1910.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.142","Cochlear implant","","A cochlear implant (CI) is a surgically implanted neuroprosthetic device to provide a person with moderate to profound sensorineural hearing loss a modified sense of sound. CI bypasses the normal acoustic hearing process to replace it with electric signals which directly stimulate the auditory nerve. A person with a cochlear implant receiving intensive auditory training may learn to interpret those signals as sound and speech. However, one third of deaf children do not develop language if they are on a CI program alone and have no sign language input.[1]\nThe implant has two main components. The outside component is generally worn behind the ear, but could also be attached to clothing, for example, in young children. This component, the sound processor, contains microphones, electronics that include Digital Signal Processor chips, battery, and a coil which transmits a signal to the implant across the skin.  The inside component, the actual implant, has a coil to receive signals, electronics, and an array of electrodes which is placed into the cochlea, which stimulate the cochlear nerve.\nThe surgical procedure is performed under general anesthesia. Surgical risks are minimal but can include tinnitus, facial nerve bruising and dizziness.\nFrom the early days of implants in the 1970s and the 1980s, speech perception via an implant has steadily increased. Many users of modern implants gain reasonable to good hearing and speech perception skills post-implantation, especially when combined with lipreading. However, for pre-lingually deaf children the risk of not acquiring spoken language even with an implant may be as high as 30%.[2] One of the challenges that remain with these implants is that hearing and speech understanding skills after implantation show a wide range of variation across individual implant users. Factors such as duration and cause of hearing loss, how the implant is situated in the cochlea, the overall health of the cochlear nerve, but also individual capabilities of re-learning are considered to contribute to this variation, yet no certain predictive factors are known.Despite providing the ability for hearing and oral speech communication to children and adults with severe to profound hearing loss, there is also controversy around the devices. Much of the strongest objection to cochlear implants has come from the Deaf community. For some in the Deaf community, cochlear implants are an affront to their culture, which as some view it, is a minority threatened by the hearing majority.\n\n","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.144","Cold fusion","","Cold fusion is a hypothesized type of nuclear reaction that would occur at, or near, room temperature. It would contrast starkly with the ""hot"" fusion that is known to take place naturally within stars and artificially in hydrogen bombs and prototype fusion reactors under immense pressure and at temperatures of millions of degrees, and be distinguished from muon-catalyzed fusion. There is currently no accepted theoretical model that would allow cold fusion to occur.\nIn 1989, two electrochemists, Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons, reported that their apparatus had produced anomalous heat (""excess heat"") of a magnitude they asserted would defy explanation except in terms of nuclear processes. They further reported measuring small amounts of nuclear reaction byproducts, including neutrons and tritium. The small tabletop experiment involved electrolysis of heavy water on the surface of a palladium (Pd) electrode. The reported results received wide media attention and raised hopes of a cheap and abundant source of energy.Many scientists tried to replicate the experiment with the few details available. Hopes faded due to the large number of negative replications, the withdrawal of many reported positive replications, the discovery of flaws and sources of experimental error in the original experiment, and finally the discovery that Fleischmann and Pons had not actually detected nuclear reaction byproducts. By late 1989, most scientists considered cold fusion claims dead, and cold fusion subsequently gained a reputation as pathological science. In 1989 the United States Department of Energy (DOE) concluded that the reported results of excess heat did not present convincing evidence of a useful source of energy and decided against allocating funding specifically for cold fusion. A second DOE review in 2004, which looked at new research, reached similar conclusions and did not result in DOE funding of cold fusion.A small community of researchers continues to investigate cold fusion, now often preferring the designation low-energy nuclear reactions (LENR) or condensed matter nuclear science (CMNS). Since articles about cold fusion are rarely published in peer-reviewed mainstream scientific journals any longer, they do not attract the level of scrutiny expected for mainstream scientific publications.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.143","Cold War","","The Cold War was a period of geopolitical tension between the Soviet Union and the United States and their respective allies, the Eastern Bloc and the Western Bloc, after World War II. The period is generally considered to span the 1947 Truman Doctrine to the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union. The term ""cold"" is used because there was no large-scale fighting directly between the two superpowers, but they each supported major regional conflicts known as proxy wars. The conflict was based around the ideological and geopolitical struggle for global influence by the two powers, following their temporary alliance and victory against Nazi Germany in 1945. Whilst the Western Bloc and Eastern Bloc generally espoused the economic theories of capitalism and socialism, respectively, the conflict was mostly geopolitical in nature. Each power had a nuclear strategy that discouraged a pre-emptive attack by the other side, on the basis that such an attack would lead to the total destruction of the attacker\u2014the doctrine of mutually assured destruction (MAD). Aside from the nuclear arsenal development and conventional military deployment, the struggle for dominance was expressed via psychological warfare, massive propaganda campaigns and espionage, far-reaching embargoes, rivalry at sports events and technological competitions such as the Space Race.\nThe West was led by the United States, a federal republic with a two-party presidential system, as well as the other First World nations of the Western Bloc that were generally liberal democratic but economically and politically entwined with a network of authoritarian states, most of which were the Western Bloc's former colonies. The Soviet Union was a self-declared Marxist\u2013Leninist state that had a totalitarian government ultimately led by a committee known as the Politburo. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) had influence across the Second World. The US government supported right-wing governments and uprisings across the world, while the Soviet government funded communist parties and revolutions around the world. As nearly all the colonial states achieved independence in the period 1945\u20131960, they became Third World battlefields in the Cold War.\nThe first phase of the Cold War began in the first two years after the end of the Second World War in 1945. The Soviet Union had been left with power over the former Nazi territories of Eastern Europe, while the United States had extensive military and financial influence over the countries of Western Europe (for example, supporting the anti-communist side in the 1946\u201349 Greek Civil War) and created the NATO military alliance in 1949. The US termed their global policy against Soviet influence containment. The Berlin Blockade (1948\u201349) was the first major crisis of the Cold War. The conflict expanded with the 1949 victory of the Communist side in the Chinese Civil War and the outbreak of the Korean War (1950\u20131953). The USSR and the US competed for influence in Latin America and the decolonizing states of Africa and Asia. The Soviet Union formed the Warsaw Pact in 1955 in response to NATO. The Soviets suppressed the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, and later more escalating crises occurred, such as the Suez Crisis (1956), the Berlin Crisis of 1961 and the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, which was perhaps the closest the two sides came to nuclear war. In 1961, a group of countries including India, Indonesia and Yugoslavia launched the nominally-neutral Non-Aligned Movement, which never had much power. Meanwhile, an international peace movement took root among citizens around the world. Movements against nuclear arms testing and for nuclear disarmament gained popularity at the turn of the 1960s and continued through the 1970s and 1980s, with large anti-war protests. Following the Cuban Missile Crisis, a new phase began that saw the Sino-Soviet split between China and the Soviet Union complicate relations within the Communist sphere, while US ally France began to demand greater authority of action. The USSR suppressed the 1968 Prague Spring liberalization program in Czechoslovakia, while the US experienced internal turmoil from the civil rights movement and opposition to the Vietnam War (1955\u201375), which ended with the defeat of the US-backed South Vietnam.\nBy the 1970s, both sides had started making allowances for peace and security, ushering in a period of d\u00e9tente that saw the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks and the US opening relations with the People's Republic of China as a strategic counterweight to the USSR. D\u00e9tente collapsed at the end of the decade with the beginning of the Soviet\u2013Afghan War in 1979. The early 1980s were another period of elevated tension, with the 1983 Soviet downing of KAL Flight 007 and the ""Able Archer"" NATO military exercises. The United States increased diplomatic, military, and economic pressures on the Soviet Union, at a time when it was already suffering from economic stagnation. In the mid-1980s, the new Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev introduced the liberalizing reforms of perestroika (""reorganization"", 1987) and glasnost (""openness"", c. 1985) and ended Soviet involvement in Afghanistan. Pressures for national sovereignty grew stronger in Eastern Europe, especially Poland, and Gorbachev refused to militarily support their governments any longer. The result in 1989 was a wave of revolutions that peacefully (with the exception of the Romanian Revolution) overthrew all of the communist governments of Central and Eastern Europe. The CPSU itself lost control in the Soviet Union and was banned following an abortive coup attempt in August 1991. This in turn led to the formal dissolution of the USSR in December 1991, the declaration of independence of its constituent republics and the collapse of communist governments across much of Africa and Asia. The United States was left as the world's only superpower.\nThe Cold War and its events have left a significant legacy. It is often referred to in popular culture, especially in media featuring themes of espionage (notably the internationally successful James Bond book and film franchise) and the threat of nuclear warfare. Meanwhile, a renewed state of tension between the Soviet Union's successor state, Russia, and the United States in the 2010s (including its Western allies) and growing tension between an increasingly powerful China and the U.S. and its Western allies have each been referred to as the Second Cold War.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.145","Communism","","Communism (from Latin communis, ""common, universal"") is a philosophical, social, political, economic ideology and movement whose ultimate goal is the establishment of a communist society, namely a socioeconomic order structured upon the ideas of common ownership of the means of production and the absence of social classes, money and the state.Communism includes a variety of schools of thought which broadly include Marxism and anarchism (especially anarcho-communism) as well as the political ideologies grouped around both. All of these share the analysis that the current order of society stems from its economic system and mode of production, capitalism; that in this system there are two major social classes; that conflict between these two classes is the root of all problems in society; and that this situation will ultimately be resolved through a social revolution. The two classes are the proletariat (the working class)\u2014who must work to survive and who make up the majority within society\u2014and the bourgeoisie (the capitalist class)\u2014a minority who derives profit from employing the working class through private ownership of the means of production. According to this analysis, revolution would put the working class in power and in turn establish social ownership of the means of production which is the primary element in the transformation of society towards communism.\nAlong with social democracy, communism became the dominant political tendency within the international socialist movement by the 1920s. While the emergence of the Soviet Union as the world's first nominally communist state led to communism's widespread association with the Soviet economic model and Marxism\u2013Leninism, some economists and intellectuals argued that in practice the model functioned as a form of state capitalism, or a non-planned administrative or command economy.","wikipedia","['5.5','5.6']"
"3.147","Communist government","","A communist state, also known as Marxist\u2013Leninist state, is a state that is administered and governed by a single communist party guided by Marxism\u2013Leninism.

Marxism\u2013Leninism remains the ideology of several communist states around the world and the official ideology of the ruling parties of China, Cuba, Laos and Vietnam.Communist states are typically administered by a single, centralized party apparatus. Although some provide the impression of multiple political parties, these are all solely in control by that centralized party. These parties are usually Marxist\u2013Leninist or some national variation thereof such as Maoism or Titoism, with the official aim of achieving socialism and progressing toward a communist society. There have been several instances of communist states with functioning political participation processes involving several other non-party organizations such as direct democratic participation, factory committees and trade unions.As a term, communist state is used by Western historians, political scientists and media to refer to these countries and distinguish them from other socialist states. However, these states do not describe themselves as communist nor do they claim to have achieved communism\u2014they refer to themselves as socialist states that are in the process of constructing socialism.

"3.146","Communist Party of China","","The Communist Party of China (CPC) is the founding and ruling political party of the People's Republic of China (PRC). The CPC is the sole governing party within mainland China, permitting only eight other, subordinated parties to co-exist, those making up the United Front. It was founded in 1921, chiefly by Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao. The party grew quickly, and by 1949 it had driven the Kuomintang (KMT)'s nationalist government from mainland China after the Chinese Civil War, leading to the establishment of the People's Republic of China. It also controls the world's largest armed forces, the People's Liberation Army.\nThe CPC is officially organised on the basis of democratic centralism, a principle conceived by Russian Marxist theoretician Vladimir Lenin which entails democratic and open discussion on policy on the condition of unity in upholding the agreed upon policies. The highest body of the CPC is the National Congress, convened every fifth year. When the National Congress is not in session, the Central Committee is the highest body, but since the body meets normally only once a year most duties and responsibilities are vested in the Politburo and its Standing Committee. The party's leader recently holds the offices of General Secretary (responsible for civilian party duties), Chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) (responsible for military affairs) and State President (a largely ceremonial position). Through these posts, the party leader is the country's paramount leader. The current paramount leader is General Secretary Xi Jinping, elected at the 18th National Congress held in October 2012.\nThe CPC is committed to communism and continues to participate in the International Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties each year. According to the party constitution, the CPC adheres to Marxism\u2013Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, socialism with Chinese characteristics, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Three Represents, the Scientific Outlook on Development, and Xi Jinping Thought. The official explanation for China's economic reforms is that the country is in the primary stage of socialism, a developmental stage similar to the capitalist mode of production. The command economy established under Mao Zedong was replaced by the socialist market economy under Deng Xiaoping, the current economic system, on the basis that ""Practice is the Sole Criterion for the Truth"".\nSince the collapse of Eastern European communist governments in 1989\u20131990 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the CPC has emphasised its party-to-party relations with the ruling parties of the remaining socialist states. While the CPC still maintains party-to-party relations with non-ruling communist parties around the world, since the 1980s it has established relations with several non-communist parties, most notably with ruling parties of one-party states (whatever their ideology), dominant parties in democracies (whatever their ideology) and social democratic parties.","wikipedia","5.5"

"3.149","Confederate States of America","","The Confederate States of America (CSA or C.S.)\u2014commonly referred to as the Confederacy\u2014was an unrecognized republic in North America that existed from 1861 to 1865. The Confederacy was originally formed by seven secessionist slave-holding states\u2014South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas\u2014in the Lower South region of the United States, whose economy was heavily dependent upon agriculture, particularly cotton, and a plantation system that relied upon the labor of African-American slaves. Convinced that the institution of slavery was threatened by the November 1860 election of Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln to the U.S. presidency on a platform which opposed the expansion of slavery into the western territories, the Confederacy declared its secession in rebellion against the United States, with the loyal states becoming known as the Union during the ensuing American Civil War. Confederate Vice President Alexander H. Stephens described its ideology as being centrally based ""upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition"".Before Lincoln took office in March, a new Confederate government was established in February 1861 which was considered illegal by the government of the United States. States volunteered militia units, and the new government hastened to form its own Confederate States Army from nothing practically overnight. After the American Civil War began in April, four slave states of the Upper South\u2014Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina\u2014also seceded and joined the Confederacy. The Confederacy later accepted Missouri and Kentucky as members, although neither officially declared secession nor were they ever largely controlled by Confederate forces; Confederate shadow governments attempted to control the two states but were later exiled from them. The government of the United States (the Union) rejected the claims of secession, considering it illegitimate.\nThe war began April 12, 1861, when the Confederates attacked Fort Sumter, a Union fort in the harbor of Charleston, South Carolina. No foreign government ever officially recognized the Confederacy as an independent country, although Great Britain and France granted it belligerent status, which allowed Confederate agents to contract with private concerns for arms and other supplies. In early 1865, after four years of heavy fighting which led to 620,000\u2013850,000 military deaths, all Confederate forces surrendered. The war lacked a formal end; nearly all Confederate forces had been forced into surrender or deliberately disbanded by the end of 1865, by which point the dwindling manpower and resources of the Confederacy faced overwhelming odds. Jefferson Davis, the President of the Confederate States of America for the duration of the civil war, lamented that the Confederacy had ""disappeared"".\nAfter the war, Confederate states were readmitted to the Union during the Reconstruction era, after each ratified the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which outlawed slavery. ""Lost Cause"" ideology\u2014a view that the Confederate cause was a just one\u2014emerged in the decades after the war among former Confederate generals and politicians, as well as organizations such as the Sons of Confederate Veterans and the United Daughters of the Confederacy. Particularly intense periods of Lost Cause activity came around the time of World War I, as the last Confederate veterans began to die and a push was made to preserve their memories, and during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s, in reaction to growing public support for racial equality. Through activities such as building prominent Confederate monuments and writing school history textbooks, they sought to ensure future generations of Southern whites would continue to support white supremacist policies such as Jim Crow. The modern display of flags used by and associated with the Confederate States of America primarily started in the mid-20th century and has continued into the present day; their revival in the 1950s and 1960s began with Senator Strom Thurmond's Dixiecrats to show opposition to the Civil Rights Movement, among other things, in 1948.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.150","Conjoined twins","","Conjoined twins also known as Siamese twins are identical twins joined in utero. An extremely rare phenomenon, the occurrence is estimated to range from 1 in 49,000 births to 1 in 189,000 births, with a somewhat higher incidence in Southwest Asia and Africa. Approximately half are stillborn, and an additional one-third die within 24 hours. Most live births are female, with a ratio of 3:1.Two contradicting theories exist to explain the origins of conjoined twins. The more generally accepted theory is fission, in which the fertilized egg splits partially. The other theory, no longer believed to be the basis of conjoined twinning, is fusion, in which a fertilized egg completely separates, but stem cells (which search for similar cells) find similar stem cells on the other twin and fuse the twins together. Conjoined twins share a single common chorion, placenta, and amniotic sac, although these characteristics are not exclusive to conjoined twins, as there are some monozygotic but non-conjoined twins who also share these structures in utero.Chang and Eng Bunker (1811\u20131874), Thai brothers born in Siam, now Thailand, traveled widely for many years and were labeled as The Siamese Twins. Chang and Eng were joined at the torso by a band of flesh, cartilage, and their fused livers. In modern times, they could have been easily separated.  Due to the brothers' fame and the rarity of the condition, the term ""Siamese twins"" came to be used as a synonym for conjoined twins.\n\n","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.151","Conservatism in the United States","","Conservatism in the United States is a political and social philosophy characterized by respect for American traditions, republicanism, support for Christian values, moral universalism, pro-business and anti-labor union, anti-communism, individualism, advocacy of American exceptionalism, and a defense of Western culture from the perceived threats posed by socialism, authoritarianism, and moral relativism.As with all major American political parties, liberty is a core value. American conservatives consider individual liberty\u2014within the bounds of American values\u2014as the fundamental trait of democracy; this perspective contrasts with that of modern American liberals, who generally place a greater value on equality and social justice and emphasize the need for state intervention to achieve these goals. American conservatives believe in limiting government in size and scope, and in a balance between national government and states' rights. Apart from some libertarians, they tend to favor strong action in areas they believe to be within government's legitimate jurisdiction, particularly national defense and law enforcement. Social conservatives oppose abortion and same-sex marriage, while privileging traditional marriage and supporting Christian prayer in public schools.Like most American political ideologies, conservatism originates from republicanism, which rejected aristocratic and monarchical government and upheld the principles of the United States Declaration of Independence (""All men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness"") and the United States Constitution (which established a federal republic under the rule of law). Conservative philosophy is also derived in part from the classical liberal tradition of the 18th and 19th centuries, which advocated for laissez-faire economics (i.e. economic freedom and deregulation).Historians such as Patrick Allitt and political theorists such as Russell Kirk argue that the conservative tradition has played a major role in American politics and culture since 1776. However, they assert that an organized conservative movement with beliefs that differ from those of other American political parties has played a key role in politics only since the 1950s. The recent movement is based in the Republican Party; however, some Southern Democrats were also important figures early in the movement's history.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.152","Conservative Judaism","","Conservative Judaism (known as Masorti Judaism outside North America) is a Jewish religious movement which regards the authority of Jewish law and tradition as emanating primarily from the assent of the people and the community through the generations, more than from divine revelation. It therefore views Jewish law, or halakha, as both binding and subject to historical development. The Conservative rabbinate employs modern historical-critical research, rather than only traditional methods and sources, and lends great weight to its constituency when determining its stance on matters of practice. The movement considers its approach as the authentic and most appropriate continuation of halakhic discourse, maintaining both fealty to received forms and flexibility in their interpretation. It also eschews strict theological definitions, lacking a consensus in matters of faith and allowing great pluralism.\nWhile regarding itself as the heir of Rabbi Zecharias Frankel's 19th-century Positive-Historical School in Europe, Conservative Judaism fully institutionalized only in the United States during the mid-20th century. Its largest center today is in North America, where its main congregational arm is the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism and the New York\u2013based Jewish Theological Seminary of America operates as its largest rabbinic seminary. Globally, affiliated communities are united within the umbrella organization Masorti Olami. Conservative Judaism is the third-largest Jewish religious movement worldwide, estimated to represent close to 1.1 million people, both over 600,000 registered adult congregants and many non-member identifiers.","wikipedia","5.1"

"3.154","Constitutional law","","Constitutional law is a body of law which defines the role, powers, and structure of different entities within a state, namely, the executive, the parliament or legislature, and the judiciary; as well as the basic rights of citizens and, in federal countries such as the United States and Canada, the relationship between the central government and state, provincial, or territorial governments.\nNot all nation states have codified constitutions, though all such states have a jus commune, or law of the land, that may consist of a variety of imperative and consensual rules. These may include customary law, conventions, statutory law, judge-made law, or international rules and norms. Constitutional law deals with the fundamental principles by which the government exercises its authority. In some instances, these principles grant specific powers to the government, such as the power to tax and spend for the welfare of the population. Other times, constitutional principles act to place limits on what the government can do, such as prohibiting the arrest of an individual without sufficient cause.\nIn most nations, such as the United States, India, and Singapore, constitutional law is based on the text of a document ratified at the time the nation came into being. Other constitutions, notably that of the United Kingdom, rely heavily on unwritten rules known as constitutional conventions; their status within constitutional law varies, and the terms of conventions are in some cases strongly contested.\n\n","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.155","Controversy","","Controversy is a state of prolonged public dispute or debate, usually concerning a matter of conflicting opinion or point of view. The word was coined from the Latin controversia, as a composite of controversus \u2013 ""turned in an opposite direction","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.156","Conversion therapy","","Conversion therapy is the pseudoscientific practice of trying to change an individual's sexual orientation from homosexual or bisexual to heterosexual using psychological or spiritual interventions. There is no reliable evidence that sexual orientation can be changed and medical institutions warn that conversion therapy practices are ineffective and potentially harmful. Medical, scientific, and government organizations in the United States and United Kingdom have expressed concern over the validity, efficacy and ethics of conversion therapy. Various jurisdictions around the world have passed laws against conversion therapy.\nThe American Psychiatric Association (APA) opposes psychiatric treatment ""based upon the assumption that homosexuality per se is a mental disorder or based upon the a priori assumption that a patient should change his/her sexual homosexual orientation"" and describes attempts to change a person's sexual orientation by practitioners as unethical. It also states that the advancement of conversion therapy may cause social harm by disseminating unscientific views about sexual orientation. In 2001, United States Surgeon General David Satcher issued a report stating that ""there is no valid scientific evidence that sexual orientation can be changed"".Techniques used in conversion therapy in the United States and Western Europe have included ice-pick lobotomies; chemical castration with hormonal treatment; aversive treatments, such as ""the application of electric shock to the hands and/or genitals""; ""nausea-inducing drugs ... administered simultaneously with the presentation of homoerotic stimuli""; and masturbatory reconditioning. More recent clinical techniques used in the United States have been limited to counseling, visualization, social skills training, psychoanalytic therapy, and spiritual interventions such as ""prayer and group support and pressure"", though there are some reports of aversive treatments through unlicensed practice as late as the early 2000s. The term reparative therapy has been used as a synonym for conversion therapy in general, but it has been argued that strictly speaking it refers to a specific kind of therapy associated with the psychologists Elizabeth Moberly and Joseph Nicolosi.The National Association for Research & Therapy of Homosexuality (NARTH) was the main organization advocating for conversion therapy. Fundamentalist Christian groups, and some other organizations, have used religious justification for the therapy.","wikipedia","5.7"
"3.157","Copyright","","Copyright is the exclusive right given to the creator of a creative work to reproduce the work, usually for a limited time. The creative work may be in a literary, artistic, educational, or musical form. Copyright is intended to protect the original expression of an idea in the form of a creative work, but not the idea itself. A copyright is subject to limitations based on public interest considerations, such as the fair use doctrine in the United States.\nSome jurisdictions require ""fixing"" copyrighted works in a tangible form. It is often shared among multiple authors, each of whom holds a set of rights to use or license the work, and who are commonly referred to as rights holders. These rights frequently include reproduction, control over derivative works, distribution, public performance, and moral rights such as attribution.Copyrights can be granted by public law and are in that case considered ""territorial rights"". This means that copyrights granted by the law of a certain state, do not extend beyond the territory of that specific jurisdiction. Copyrights of this type vary by country; many countries, and sometimes a large group of countries, have made agreements with other countries on procedures applicable when works ""cross"" national borders or national rights are inconsistent.Typically, the public law duration of a copyright expires 50 to 100 years after the creator dies, depending on the jurisdiction. Some countries require certain copyright formalities to establishing copyright, others recognize copyright in any completed work, without formal registration.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.158","Corsica","","Corsica (; French: Corse [k\u0254\u0281s]; Corsica in Corsican and Italian, pronounced [\u02c8korsiga] and [\u02c8k\u0254rsika] respectively) is an island in the Mediterranean Sea and one of the 18 regions of France. It is located southeast of the French mainland and west of the Italian Peninsula, with the nearest land mass being the Italian island of Sardinia to the immediate south. A single chain of mountains makes up two-thirds of the island.\nThe island is an administrative region of France (with the regional capital being Ajaccio), divided in two administrative departments, Haute-Corse and Corse-du-Sud. The corresponding regional and departmental territorial collectivities, however, merged on 1 January 2018, forming the single territorial collectivity of Corsica. As a single territorial collectivity, Corsica enjoys a greater degree of autonomy than other French regional collectivities; for example, the Corsican Assembly is able to exercise limited executive powers. Bastia, the prefecture city of Haute-Corse, is the second largest town in Corsica.\nAfter being ruled by the Republic of Genoa since 1284, in 1755 Corsica became a self-proclaimed Italian-speaking Republic, until it was officially ceded by Genoa to Louis XV as part of a pledge for debts and subsequently annexed to France in 1769. Napoleon Bonaparte was born the same year in Ajaccio, and his ancestral home (Maison Bonaparte) is today a significant visitor attraction and museum. Due to Corsica's historical ties with the Italian peninsula, the island retains many Italian cultural elements, and the native tongue is recognized as a regional language by the French government.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.160","Creationism","","Creationism is the religious belief that nature, and aspects such as the universe, Earth, life, and humans, originated with supernatural acts of divine creation. \nIn its broadest sense, creationism includes a continuum of religious views, \nwhich vary in their acceptance or rejection of scientific explanations such as evolution that describe the origin and development of natural phenomena.The term creationism most often refers to belief in special creation; the claim that the universe and lifeforms were created as they exist today by divine action, and that the only true explanations are those which are compatible with a Christian fundamentalist literal interpretation of the creation myths found in the Bible's Genesis creation narrative. Since the 1970s, the commonest form of this has been young Earth creationism which posits special creation of the universe and lifeforms within the last 10,000 years on the basis of Flood geology, and promotes pseudoscientific creation science. From the 18th century onwards, old Earth creationism accepted geological time harmonized with Genesis through gap or day-age theory, while supporting anti-evolution. Modern old-Earth creationists support progressive creationism and continue to reject evolutionary explanations. Following political controversy, creation science was reformulated as intelligent design and neo-creationism.Mainline Protestants and the Catholic Church reconcile modern science with their faith in Creation through forms of theistic evolution which hold that God purposefully created through the laws of nature, and accept evolution. Some groups call their belief evolutionary creationism.Less prominently, there are also members of the Islamic and Hindu faiths who are creationists.\nUse of the term ""creationist"" in this context dates back to Charles Darwin's unpublished 1842 sketch draft for what became On the Origin of Species, and he used the term later in letters to colleagues. Asa Gray published a 1873 article in The Nation saying a ""special creationist"" maintaining that species ""were supernaturally originated just as they are, by the very terms of his doctrine places them out of the reach of scientific explanation.""","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.159","Creation science","","Creation science or scientific creationism  is a branch of creationism, presented without obvious Biblical language but with the claim that special creation and flood geology based on the Genesis creation narrative in the Book of Genesis have validity as science. Creationists also claim it disproves or reexplains a variety of scientific facts, theories and paradigms of geology,  cosmology, biological evolution, archaeology, history, and linguistics. However, the overwhelming consensus of the scientific community is that creation science fails to qualify as scientific because it lacks empirical support, supplies no tentative hypotheses, and resolves to describe natural history in terms of scientifically untestable supernatural causes. Courts, most often in the United States where the question has been asked in the context of teaching the subject in public schools, have consistently ruled since the 1980s that creation science is a religious view rather than a scientific one. Historians, philosophers of science and skeptics describe creation science as a pseudoscientific attempt to map the Bible into scientific facts. Professional biologists have criticized creation science for being unscholarly, and even as a dishonest and misguided sham, with extremely harmful educational consequences.Creation science began in the 1960s, as a fundamentalist Christian effort in the United States to prove Biblical inerrancy and nullify the scientific evidence for evolution. It has since developed a sizable religious following in the United States, with creation science ministries branching worldwide. The main ideas in creation science are: the belief in ""creation ex nihilo"" (Latin: out of nothing); the conviction that the Earth was created within the last 6,000\u201310,000 years; the belief that humans and other life on Earth were created as distinct fixed ""baraminological"" kinds; and the idea that fossils found in geological strata were deposited during a cataclysmic flood which completely covered the entire Earth. As a result, creation science also challenges the commonly accepted geologic and astrophysical theories for the age and origins of the Earth and universe, which creationists believe are irreconcilable with the account in the Book of Genesis. Creation science proponents often refer to the theory of evolution as ""Darwinism"" or as ""Darwinian evolution.""\nThe creation science texts and curricula that first emerged in the 1960s focused upon concepts derived from a literal interpretation of the Bible and were overtly religious in nature, most notably linking Noah's flood in the Biblical Genesis account to the geological and fossil record. These works attracted little notice beyond the schools and congregations of conservative fundamental and Evangelical Christians until the 1970s, when its followers challenged the teaching of evolution in the public schools and other venues in the United States, bringing it to the attention of the public-at-large and the scientific community. Many school boards and lawmakers were persuaded to include the teaching of creation science alongside evolution in the science curriculum. Creation science texts and curricula used in churches and Christian schools were revised to eliminate their Biblical and theological references, and less explicitly sectarian versions of creation science education were introduced in public schools in Louisiana, Arkansas, and other regions in the United States.The 1982 ruling in McLean v. Arkansas found that creation science fails to meet the essential characteristics of science and that its chief intent is to advance a particular religious view. The teaching of creation science in public schools in the United States effectively ended in 1987 following the United States Supreme Court decision in Edwards v. Aguillard. The court affirmed that a statute requiring the teaching of creation science alongside evolution when evolution is taught in Louisiana public schools was unconstitutional because its sole true purpose was to advance a particular religious belief.In response to this ruling, drafts of the creation science school textbook Of Pandas and People were edited to change references of creation to intelligent design before its publication in 1989. The intelligent design movement promoted this version. Requiring intelligent design to be taught in public school science classes was found to be unconstitutional in the 2005 Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District federal court case.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.161","Creole language","","A creole language, or simply creole, is a stable natural language that develops from the simplifying and mixing of different languages into a new one within a fairly brief period of time: often, a pidgin evolved into a full-fledged language. While the concept is similar to that of a mixed or hybrid language, creoles are often characterized by a tendency to systematize their inherited grammar (e.g., by eliminating irregularities or regularizing the conjugation of otherwise irregular verbs). Like any language, creoles are characterized by a consistent system of grammar, possess large stable vocabularies, and are acquired by children as their native language. These three features distinguish a creole language from a pidgin. \nCreolistics, or creology, is the study of creole languages and, as such, is a subfield of linguistics. Someone who engages in this study is called a creolist.\nThe precise number of creole languages is not known, particularly as many are poorly attested or documented. About one hundred creole languages have arisen since 1500.  These are predominantly based on European languages such as English and French due to the European Age of Discovery and the Atlantic slave trade that arose at that time. With the improvements in ship-building and navigation, traders had to learn to communicate with people around the world, and the quickest way to do this was to develop a pidgin, or simplified language suited to the purpose; in turn, full creole languages developed from these pidgins. In addition to creoles that have European languages as their base, there are, for example, creoles based on Arabic, Chinese, and Malay. The creole with the largest number of speakers is Haitian Creole, with almost ten million native speakers, followed by Tok Pisin with about 4 million, most of whom are second-language speakers.\nThe lexicon (or, roughly, the base or essential vocabulary \u2013 such as ""say"" but not ""said, tell, told"") of a creole language is largely supplied by the parent languages, particularly that of the most dominant group in the social context of the creole's construction. However, there are often clear phonetic and semantic shifts. On the other hand, the grammar that has evolved often has new or unique features that differ substantially from those of the parent languages.\n\n","wikipedia","5.10"
"3.162","Crime","","In ordinary language, a crime is an unlawful act punishable by a state or other authority. The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law. One proposed definition is that a crime or offence (or criminal offence) is an act harmful not only to some individual but also to a community, society, or the state (""a public wrong""). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.The notion that acts such as murder, rape, and theft are to be prohibited exists worldwide. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.\nThe state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. In modern societies, there are procedures to which investigations and trials must adhere. If found guilty, an offender may be sentenced to a form of reparation such as a community sentence, or, depending on the nature of their offence, to undergo imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, execution.\nUsually, to be classified as a crime, the ""act of doing something criminal"" (actus reus) must \u2013 with certain exceptions \u2013 be accompanied by the ""intention to do something criminal"" (mens rea).While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime. Breaches of private law (torts and breaches of contract) are not automatically punished by the state, but can be enforced through civil procedure.\n\n","wikipedia","5.0"
"3.163","Crime in the United States","","Crime in the United States has been recorded since colonization. Crime rates have varied over time, with a sharp rise after 1963, reaching a broad bulging peak between the 1970s and early 1990s. Since then, crime has declined significantly and current crime rates are approximately the same as those of the 1960s.Statistics on specific crimes are indexed in the annual Uniform Crime Reports by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and by annual National Crime Victimization Surveys by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. In addition to the primary Uniform Crime Report known as Crime in the United States, the FBI publishes annual reports on the status of law enforcement in the United States. The report's definitions of specific crimes are considered standard by many American law enforcement agencies. According to the FBI, index crime in the United States includes violent crime and property crime. Violent crime consists of five criminal offenses: murder and non-negligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, and gang violence; property crime consists of burglary, larceny, motor vehicle theft, and arson.","wikipedia","5.5"

Issues with ease of use, robustness, and security of the company's software are common targets for critics. In the 2000s, a number of malware mishaps targeted security flaws in Windows and other products. Microsoft was also accused of locking vendors and consumers in to their products, and of not following or complying with existing standards in its software. Total cost of ownership comparisons between Linux and Microsoft Windows are a continuous point of debate.The company has been the subject of numerous lawsuits, brought by several governments and by other companies, for unlawful monopolistic practices.

"3.166","Criticism of Walmart","","Walmart  has been criticized by groups and individuals, including labor unions and small-town advocates protesting against Walmart policies and business practices and their effects. Criticisms include charges of racial and gender discrimination, foreign product sourcing, treatment of product suppliers, environmental practices, the use of public subsidies, and the company's spying on its employees. Walmart denies any wrongdoing and says that low prices are the result of efficiency.In 2005, labor unions created new organizations and websites to criticize the company, including Wake Up Walmart (United Food and Commercial Workers) and Walmart Watch (Service Employees International Union). By the end of 2005, Walmart had launched Working Families for Walmart to counter those groups.  Efforts to counter criticism include a public relations campaign in 2005,  which included several television commercials. The company retained the public relations firm Edelman to interact with the press and respond to negative media reports, and has started working with bloggers by sending them news, suggesting topics for postings, and inviting them to visit Walmart's corporate headquarters. In November 2005, a documentary film critical of Walmart (Walmart: The High Cost of Low Price) was released on DVD.\nEconomists at the Cato Institute say that Walmart is successful because it sells products that consumers want at low prices,  satisfying customers' wants and needs. Walmart's critics say that Walmart's lower prices draw customers away from smaller Main Street businesses, hurting local small-town communities. Critics also say that Walmart is hurting the United States economy because of excessive reliance on Chinese products. Walmart is the largest importer in the United States in many categories such as electronics and fast-moving consumer goods.  The 2006 book The Walmart Effect by business journalist Charles Fishman contains much of the criticism, though it also enumerates Walmart's positive impacts within society.\n\n","wikipedia","5.5"

"3.168","Crusades","","The Crusades were a series of religious wars in Europe and western Asia initiated, supported and sometimes directed by the Catholic Church between the 11th and the 17th centuries. The crusades differed from other religious conflicts in that participants considered them a penitential exercise that brought absolution. Historians contest the definition of the term ""crusade"" with some restricting it to armed pilgrimages to Jerusalem; others including all Catholic military campaigns with a promise of spiritual benefits; all Catholic holy wars; or those with characteristic religious fervour. The most well known are those fought against the Muslims of the eastern Mediterranean for the Holy Land between 1096 and 1271. Crusades were also fought from the 12th century against the Iberian Moors, the Ottoman Empire and in several other regions. The reasons for these included fighting pagans, the suppression of heresy and conflict between Catholic groups.\nIn 1095 Pope Urban II proclaimed the First Crusade at the Council of Clermont. He encouraged military support for the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I against the Seljuk Turks and an armed pilgrimage to Jerusalem. There was an enthusiastic response in western Europe across all social strata. Historians debate the combination of motivations of the volunteers who took a public vow to join the crusade\u2014the prospect of mass ascension into Heaven at Jerusalem, satisfying feudal obligations, opportunities for renown, economic and political advantage are all considered. Four Crusader states were established in the Near East: the County of Edessa; the Principality of Antioch; the Kingdom of Jerusalem; and the County of Tripoli. A crusader presence remained in the region in some form until Acre, the last mainland outpost, fell in 1291, after which there were no further crusades to recover the Holy Land.\nThe Reconquista, the struggle between the Christians and Muslims in the Iberian Peninsula, was proclaimed a crusade in 1123 and ended with the fall of Emirate of Granada in 1492. The Northern Crusades that brought the pagan tribes of north-eastern Europe under Christian control were considered crusades from 1147. In 1199 Pope Innocent III began the practice of  proclaiming political crusades against disobedient Christian rulers. In Languedoc from 1208, crusading was used against heretics; this continued in Savoy and Bohemia in the 15th century and against Protestants in the 16th century. Crusading was used in response to the rise of the Ottoman Empire in the mid-14th century, only ending with the War of the Holy League in 1699.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.169","Cryonics","","Cryonics (from Greek: \u03ba\u03c1\u03cd\u03bf\u03c2 kryos meaning 'cold') is the low-temperature freezing (usually at \u2212196 \u00b0C or \u2212320.8 \u00b0F or 77.1 K) and storage of a human corpse or severed head, with the speculative hope that resurrection may be possible in the future. Cryonics is regarded with skepticism within the mainstream scientific community. It is generally viewed as a pseudoscience, and its practice has been characterized as quackery.Cryonics procedures can begin only after clinical death, and cryonics ""patients"" are legally dead. Cryonics procedures may begin within minutes of death, and use cryoprotectants to prevent ice formation during cryopreservation. It is, however, not possible for a corpse to be reanimated after undergoing vitrification, as this causes damage to the brain including its neural networks. The first corpse to be frozen was that of Dr. James Bedford in 1967. As of 2014, about 250 dead bodies had been cryopreserved in the United States, and 1,500 people had made arrangements for cryopreservation of their corpses.Economic reality means it is highly improbable that any cryonics corporation could continue in business long enough to take advantage of the claimed long-term benefits offered. Early attempts of cryonic preservations were performed in the 1960s and early 1970s which ended in failure with companies going out of business, and their stored corpses thawed and disposed of.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.170","Cryptocurrency","","A cryptocurrency (or crypto currency) is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses strong cryptography to secure financial transactions, control the creation of additional units, and verify the transfer of assets. Cryptocurrencies use decentralized control as opposed to centralized digital currency and central banking systems.The decentralized control of each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain, that serves as a public financial transaction database.Bitcoin, first released as open-source software in 2009, is generally considered the first decentralized cryptocurrency. Since the release of bitcoin, over 6,000 altcoins (alternative variants of bitcoin, or other cryptocurrencies) have been created.","wikipedia","5.4"
"3.171","Cult","","In modern English, a cult is a social group that is defined by its unusual religious, spiritual, or philosophical beliefs, or by its common interest in a particular personality, object or goal. This sense of the term is controversial and it has divergent definitions both in popular culture and academia and it has also been an ongoing source of contention among scholars across several fields of study. It is usually considered pejorative.\nIn the sociological classifications of religious movements, a cult is a social group with socially deviant or novel beliefs and practices, although this is often unclear. Other researchers present a less-organized picture of cults, saying that they arise spontaneously around novel beliefs and practices. Groups said to be cults range in size from local groups with a few members to international organizations with millions.Beginning in the 1930s, cults became the object of sociological study in the context of the study of religious behavior. From the 1940s the Christian countercult movement has opposed some sects and new religious movements, and it labelled them as cults for their ""un-Christian"" unorthodox beliefs. The secular anti-cult movement began in the 1970s and it opposed certain groups, often charging them with mind control and partly motivated in reaction to acts of violence committed by some of their members. Some of the claims and actions of the anti-cult movement have been disputed by scholars and by the news media, leading to further public controversy.\nAn older sense of the word cult is a set of religious devotional practices that are conventional within their culture and related to a particular figure, and often associated with a particular place. References to the ""cult"" of, for example, a particular Catholic saint, or the imperial cult of ancient Rome, use this sense of the word.\nWhile the literal original sense of the word in English remains in use, a derived sense of ""excessive devotion"" arose in the 19th century. The terms cult and cultist came into use in medical literature in the United States in the 1930s for what would now be termed ""faith healing"", especially as practised in the US Holiness movement. This usage experienced a surge of popularity at the time and extended to other forms of alternative medicine as well.","wikipedia","5.1"

It commonly refers to the hot button topics on which there is general societal disagreement and polarization in societal values is seen.\nThe term is commonly used to describe contemporary politics in the United States, with issues such as abortion, homosexuality, pornography, multiculturalism, and other cultural conflicts based on values, morality, and lifestyle being described as the major political cleavage.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.173","Cyberstalking","","Cyberstalking is the use of the Internet or other electronic means to stalk or harass an individual, group, or organization. It may include false accusations, defamation, slander and libel. It may also include monitoring, identity theft, threats, vandalism, solicitation for sex, or gathering information that may be used to threaten, embarrass or harass.Cyberstalking is often accompanied by realtime or offline stalking. In many jurisdictions, such as California, both are criminal offenses. Both are motivated by a desire to control, intimidate or influence a victim. A stalker may be an online stranger or a person whom the target knows. They may be anonymous and solicit involvement of other people online who do not even know the target.\nCyberstalking is a criminal offense under various state anti-stalking, slander and harassment laws. A conviction can result in a restraining order, probation, or criminal penalties against the assailant, including jail.","wikipedia","5.4"
"3.174","Cyprus dispute","","The Cyprus dispute, also known as the Cyprus conflict, Cyprus issue, or Cyprus problem, is an ongoing dispute between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots. Initially, with the occupation of the island by the British Empire from the Ottoman Empire in 1878 and subsequent annexation in 1914, the ""Cyprus dispute"" was identified as the conflict between the people of Cyprus and the British Crown regarding the Cypriots' demand for self-determination. The British administration shifted the dispute from a colonial dispute to an ethnic dispute between the Turkish and Greek islanders.The international complications of the dispute stretch beyond the boundaries of the island of Cyprus itself and involve the guarantor powers under the Z\u00fcrich and London Agreement (Turkey, Greece, and the United Kingdom), the United Nations and the European Union, along with (unofficially) the United States.It entered its current phase in the aftermath of the 1974 Turkish military invasion and occupation of the northern third of Cyprus. Only Turkey recognizes the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, while there is broad recognition that the ongoing military presence constitutes occupation of territories that belong to the Republic of Cyprus. According to the European Court of Human Rights, the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus should be considered a puppet state under effective Turkish control.Although the Republic of Cyprus is recognized by the international community as the sole legitimate state, the north is under the de facto administration of the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, on which the Turkish Armed Forces are stationed.The 1974 Cypriot coup d'\u00e9tat, initiated by the Greek military junta, was followed five days later by Turkey's invasion, leading to the occupation of the northern part of the internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus. In 1983, the Turkish Cypriot community unilaterally declared independence, forming the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, a sovereign entity that lacks international recognition with the exception of Turkey, with which Northern Cyprus enjoys full diplomatic relations, in violation of Resolution 550, adopted on 11 May 1984 by the United Nations Security Council.\nAs a result of the two communities and the guarantor countries committing themselves to finding a peaceful solution to the dispute, the United Nations maintains a buffer zone (known as the ""Green Line"") to avoid any further intercommunal tensions and hostilities. This zone separates the southern areas of the Republic of Cyprus (predominantly inhabited by Greek Cypriots), from the northern areas (where Turkish Cypriots and Turkish settlers are a majority). Recent years have seen warming of relations between Greek and Turkish Cypriots, with officially renewed reunification talks beginning in early 2014, though the talks have continuously stalled and resumed multiple times since they began.","wikipedia","['5.5','5.6']"
"3.175","D-Day","","The Normandy landings were the landing operations on Tuesday, 6 June 1944 of the Allied invasion of Normandy in Operation Overlord during World War II. Codenamed Operation Neptune and often referred to as D-Day, it was the largest seaborne invasion in history. The operation began the liberation of German-occupied France (and later western Europe) and laid the foundations of the Allied victory on the Western Front.\nPlanning for the operation began in 1943. In the months leading up to the invasion, the Allies conducted a substantial military deception, codenamed Operation Bodyguard, to mislead the Germans as to the date and location of the main Allied landings. The weather on D-Day was far from ideal, and the operation had to be delayed 24 hours; a further postponement would have meant a delay of at least two weeks, as the invasion planners had requirements for the phase of the moon, the tides, and the time of day that meant only a few days each month were deemed suitable. Adolf Hitler placed German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in command of German forces and of developing fortifications along the Atlantic Wall in anticipation of an Allied invasion.\nThe amphibious landings were preceded by extensive aerial and naval bombardment and an airborne assault\u2014the landing of 24,000 American, British, and Canadian airborne troops shortly after midnight. Allied infantry and armoured divisions began landing on the coast of France at 06:30. The target 50-mile (80 km) stretch of the Normandy coast was divided into five sectors: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, and Sword. Strong winds blew the landing craft east of their intended positions, particularly at Utah and Omaha. The men landed under heavy fire from gun emplacements overlooking the beaches, and the shore was mined and covered with obstacles such as wooden stakes, metal tripods, and barbed wire, making the work of the beach-clearing teams difficult and dangerous. Casualties were heaviest at Omaha, with its high cliffs. At Gold, Juno, and Sword, several fortified towns were cleared in house-to-house fighting, and two major gun emplacements at Gold were disabled using specialised tanks.\nThe Allies failed to achieve any of their goals on the first day. Carentan, St. L\u00f4, and Bayeux remained in German hands, and Caen, a major objective, was not captured until 21 July. Only two of the beaches (Juno and Gold) were linked on the first day, and all five beachheads were not connected until 12 June; however, the operation gained a foothold that the Allies gradually expanded over the coming months. German casualties on D-Day have been estimated at 4,000 to 9,000 men. Allied casualties were documented for at least 10,000, with 4,414 confirmed dead. Museums, memorials, and war cemeteries in the area now host many visitors each year.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.177","Deaf culture in the United States","","Deaf culture in the United States was born in Connecticut in 1817 at the American School for the Deaf, when a deaf teacher from France, Laurent Clerc, was recruited by Thomas Gallaudet to help found the new institution. Under the guidance and instruction of Clerc in language and ways of living, deaf American students began to evolve their own strategies for communication and for living, which became the kernel for the development of American Deaf culture.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.178","Deepwater Horizon","","Deepwater Horizon was an ultra-deepwater, dynamically positioned, semi-submersible offshore drilling rig owned by Transocean. Built in 2001 in South Korea by Hyundai Heavy Industries, the rig was commissioned by R&B Falcon (a later asset of Transocean), registered in Majuro, and leased to BP from 2001 until September 2013. In September 2009, the rig drilled the deepest oil well in history at a vertical depth of 35,050 ft (10,683 m) and measured depth of 35,055 ft (10,685 m) in the Tiber Oil Field at Keathley Canyon block 102, approximately 250 miles (400 km) southeast of Houston, in 4,132 feet (1,259 m) of water.On 20 April 2010, while drilling at the Macondo Prospect, a blowout caused an explosion on the rig that killed 11 crewmen and ignited a fireball visible from 40 miles (64 km) away. The fire was inextinguishable and, two days later, on 22 April, the Horizon sank, leaving the well gushing at the seabed and causing the largest oil spill to ever occur in U.S. waters.","wikipedia","5.9"
"3.179","Deforestation","","Deforestation, clearance, clearcutting or clearing is the removal of a forest or stand of trees from land which is then converted to a non-forest use. Deforestation can involve conversion of forest land to farms, ranches, or urban use. The most concentrated deforestation occurs in tropical rainforests. About 31% of Earth's land surface is covered by forests.Deforestation has many causes: trees can be cut down to be used for building or sold as fuel (sometimes in the form of charcoal or timber), while cleared land can be used as pasture for livestock and plantation. Disregard of ascribed value, lax forest management, and deficient environmental laws are some of the factors that lead to large-scale deforestation. In many countries, deforestation\u2014both naturally occurring and human-induced\u2014is an ongoing issue.  Between 2000 and 2012, 2.3 million square kilometres (890,000 sq mi) of forests around the world were cut down.  As of 2005, net deforestation rates had ceased to increase in countries with a per capita GDP of at least US$4,600.The removal of trees without sufficient reforestation has resulted in habitat damage, biodiversity loss, and aridity. Deforestation causes extinction, changes to climatic conditions, desertification, and displacement of populations, as observed by current conditions and in the past through the fossil record.  Deforestation also has adverse impacts on biosequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide, increasing negative feedback cycles contributing to  global warming. Global warming also puts increased pressure on communities who seek food security by clearing forests for agricultural use and reducing arable land more generally. Deforested regions typically incur significant other environmental effects such as adverse soil erosion and degradation into wasteland.\nDeforestation is more extreme in tropical and subtropical forests in emerging economies. More than half of all plant and land animal species in the world live in tropical forests. As a result of deforestation, only 6.2 million square kilometres (2.4 million square miles) remain of the original 16 million square kilometres (6 million square miles) of tropical rainforest that formerly covered the Earth. An area the size of a football pitch is cleared from the Amazon rainforest every minute, with 136 million acres (55 million hectares) of rainforest cleared for animal agriculture overall. More than 3.6 million hectares of virgin tropical forest was lost in 2018.","wikipedia","5.9"
"3.180","Deism","","Deism ( DEE-iz-\u0259m\u200a or  DAY-iz-\u0259m; derived from Latin ""deus"" meaning ""god"") is the philosophical position that rejects revelation as a source of religious knowledge and asserts that reason and observation of the natural world are sufficient to establish the existence of a Supreme Being or creator of the universe.At least as far back as Thomas Aquinas, Christian thought has recognized two sources of knowledge of God: revelation and ""natural reason"".  The study of the truths revealed by reason is called natural theology.  During the Age of Enlightenment, especially in Britain and France, philosophers began to reject revelation as a source of knowledge and to appeal only to truths that they felt could be established by reason alone.  Such philosophers were called ""deists"" and the philosophical position that they advocated is called ""deism"".  \nDeism as a distinct intellectual movement declined toward the end of the 18th century.  Some of its tenets continued to live on as part of other intellectual movements (e.g. Unitarianism) and it continues to have some advocates today.","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.181","Democratic Party (United States)","","The Democratic Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States, along with its main rival, the Republican Party. Tracing its heritage back to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison's Democratic-Republican Party, the modern-day Democratic Party was founded around 1828 by supporters of Andrew Jackson, making it the world's oldest active political party.In its early years, the Party supported limited government and state sovereignty while opposing banks and supporting slavery. Since Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal coalition in the 1930s, the Democratic Party has promoted a social liberal platform. Well into the 20th century, the party had conservative pro-business and Southern conservative-populist wings; following the New Deal, however, the conservative wing of the party largely withered outside the South. The New Deal Coalition of 1932\u20131964 attracted strong support from voters of recent European extraction\u2014many of whom were Catholics based in the cities. After the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the core bases of the two parties shifted, with the Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics and the Northeastern states becoming more reliably Democratic. The once-powerful labor union element became smaller and less supportive after the 1970s. White evangelicals and Southerners have become heavily Republican at the state and local levels since the 1990s. People living in urban areas, women, sexual minorities, millennials, and black, Latino, Jewish, Muslim, and Asian Americans tend to support the Democratic Party.The Democratic Party's philosophy of modern liberalism advocates social and economic equality, along with the welfare state. It seeks to provide government regulation in the economy to promote the public interest. Policies such as environmental protection, support for organized labor and labor unions, the introduction of social programs, affordable college tuition, universal health care, equal opportunity, and consumer protection form the core of the party's economic policy. On social issues, it advocates campaign finance reform, LGBT rights, police and immigration reform, stricter gun laws, and the legalization of marijuana.15 Democrats have served as president of the United States. The first was Andrew Jackson, who was the seventh president and served from 1829 to 1837. The most recent was Barack Obama, who was the 44th and held office from 2009 to 2017. As of 2019, the Democrats hold a majority in the House of Representatives, 15 state government trifectas (governorship and both legislative chambers), the mayoralty of most major American cities, and 19 total state legislatures. Four of the nine sitting justices of the Supreme Court were appointed by Democratic presidents.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.182","Demographics of Europe","","Figures for the population of Europe vary according to how one defines the boundaries of Europe. According to the United Nations, the population within the standard physical geographical boundaries comprised 737 million in 2010. In 2010 the population was 711 million, defining Europe's boundaries as the continental divides of the Caucasus and Ural mountains and the  Bosporous, and including the European parts of the countries of Russia and of Turkey. \nEurope's population growth is comparatively low, and its median age comparatively high, in relation to the world's other continents, especially compared to Asia, Africa and Latin America. Most of Europe is in a mode of sub-replacement fertility, which means that each new(-born) generation is becoming less populous than the older. Nonetheless most European countries still have growing populations due to immigration, population momentum and increases in life expectancy. Some current and past factors in European demography have included emigration, ethnic relations, economic immigration, a declining birth rate and an ageing population.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.183","Demographics of the United States","","The United States is the third-most populous country in the world, with an estimated population of 329,227,746 as of January 28, 2020. The United States Census Bureau shows a population increase of 0.75% for the twelve-month period ending in July 2012. Though high by industrialized country standards, this is below the world average annual rate of 1.1%. The total fertility rate in the United States estimated for 2018 is 1.73 children per woman, which is below the replacement fertility rate of approximately 2.1.\nThe American population almost quadrupled during the 20th century\u2014at a growth rate of about 1.3% a year\u2014from about 76 million in 1900 to 281 million in 2000. It is estimated to have reached the 200 million mark in 1967, and the 300 million mark on October 17, 2006. Population growth is fastest among minorities as a whole, and according to the Census Bureau's estimation for 2012, 50.4% of American children under the age of 1 belonged to racial and ethnic minority groups.White people constitute the majority of the U.S. population, with a total of about 234,370,202 or 73% of the population as of 2017. Non-Hispanic Whites make up 60.7% of the country's population. The non-Hispanic white population of the U.S. is expected to fall below 50% by 2045, primarily due to immigration and low birth rates.Hispanic and Latino Americans accounted for 48% of the national population growth of 2.9 million between July 1, 2005, and July 1, 2006. Immigrants and their U.S.-born descendants are expected to provide most of the U.S. population gains in the decades ahead.The Census Bureau projects a U.S. population of 417 million in 2060, a 38% increase from 2007 (301.3 million), and the United Nations estimates the U.S. population will be 402 million in 2050, an increase of 32% from 2007. In an official census report, it was reported that 54.4% (2,150,926 out of 3,953,593) of births in 2010 were non-Hispanic white. This represents an increase of 0.3% compared to the previous year, which was 54.1%.","wikipedia","5.5"

"3.185","Depleted uranium","","Depleted uranium (DU; also referred to in the past as Q-metal, depletalloy or D-38) is uranium with a lower content of the fissile isotope U-235 than natural uranium. Natural uranium contains about 0.72% U-235, while the DU used by the U.S. Department of Defense contains 0.3% U-235 or less. Uses of DU take advantage of its very high density of 19.1 g/cm3 (68.4% denser than lead). The less radioactive and non-fissile uranium-238 constitutes the main component of depleted uranium.\nCivilian uses include counterweights in aircraft, radiation shielding in medical radiation therapy and industrial radiography equipment, and containers for transporting radioactive materials. Military uses include armor plating and armor-piercing projectiles.\nMost depleted uranium arises as a by-product of the production of enriched uranium for use as fuel in nuclear reactors and in the manufacture of nuclear weapons. Enrichment processes generate uranium with a higher-than-natural concentration of lower-mass-number uranium isotopes (in particular U-235, which is the uranium isotope supporting the fission chain reaction) with the bulk of the feed ending up as depleted uranium, in some cases with mass fractions of U-235 and U-234 less than a third of those in natural uranium. Since U-238 has a much longer half-life than the lighter isotopes, DU emits less alpha radiation than natural uranium. DU from nuclear reprocessing has different isotopic ratios from enrichment\u2013by-product DU, from which it can be distinguished by the presence of U-236. As per an article in Al Jazeera, DU from American artillery is suspected to be one of the major causes of an increase in the general mortality rate in Iraq since 1991. DU used in US munitions has 60% of the radioactivity of natural uranium. Most of the alpha radiation comes from U-238 and U-234 whereas beta radiation comes from thorium-234 and protactinium-234 that are formed within a few weeks. Trace transuranics (another indicator of the use of reprocessed material) have been reported to be present in some US tank armor.The use of DU in munitions is controversial because of concerns about potential long-term health effects. Normal functioning of the kidney, brain, liver, heart, and numerous other systems can be affected by exposure to uranium, a toxic metal. It is only weakly radioactive because of the long radioactive half-life of uranium-238 (4468 million years) and the low amounts of uranium-234 (half-life about 246,000 years) and uranium-235 (half-life 700 million years). The biological half-life (the average time it takes for the human body to eliminate half the amount in the body) for uranium is about 15 days. The aerosol or spallation frangible powder produced by impact and combustion of depleted uranium munitions can potentially contaminate wide areas around the impact sites, leading to possible inhalation by human beings.The actual level of acute and chronic toxicity of DU is also controversial. Several studies using cultured cells and laboratory rodents suggest the possibility of leukemogenic, genetic, reproductive, and neurological effects from chronic exposure. A 2005 epidemiology review concluded: ""In aggregate the human epidemiological evidence is consistent with increased risk of birth defects in offspring of persons exposed to DU.""\n\n","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.186","Detroit","","Detroit (, locally also ; French: D\u00e9troit, lit. 'strait') is the largest and most populous city in the U.S. state of Michigan, the largest U.S. city on the United States\u2013Canada border, and the seat of Wayne County. The municipality of Detroit had a 2018 estimated population of 672,662, making it the 23rd-most populous city in the United States. The metropolitan area, known as Metro Detroit, is home to 4.3 million people, making it the second-largest in the Midwest after the Chicago metropolitan area. Regarded as a major cultural center, Detroit is known for its contributions to music and as a repository for art, architecture and design.Detroit is a major port on the Detroit River, one of the four major straits that connect the Great Lakes system to the Saint Lawrence Seaway. The Detroit Metropolitan Airport is among the most important hubs in the United States. The City of Detroit anchors the second-largest regional economy in the Midwest, behind Chicago and ahead of Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul, and the 13th-largest in the United States. Detroit and its neighboring Canadian city Windsor are connected through a highway tunnel, railway tunnel, and the Ambassador Bridge, which is the second busiest international crossing in North America, after San Diego\u2013Tijuana. Detroit is best known as the center of the U.S. automobile industry, and the ""Big Three"" auto manufacturers General Motors, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler are all headquartered in Metro Detroit.In 1701, Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac founded Fort Pontchartrain du D\u00e9troit, the future city of Detroit. During the 19th century, it became an important industrial hub at the center of the Great Lakes region. The city became the 4th-largest in the nation in 1920, after only New York City, Chicago and Philadelphia, with the influence of the booming auto industry. With expansion of the auto industry in the early 20th century, the city and its suburbs experienced rapid growth, and by the 1940s, the city had become the fourth-largest in the country. However, due to industrial restructuring, the loss of jobs in the auto industry, and rapid suburbanization, Detroit lost considerable population from the late 20th century to the present. Since reaching a peak of 1.85 million at the 1950 census, Detroit's population has declined by more than 60 percent. In 2013, Detroit became the largest U.S. city to file for bankruptcy, which it successfully exited in December 2014, when the city government regained control of Detroit's finances.Detroit's diverse culture has had both local and international influence, particularly in music, with the city giving rise to the genres of Motown and techno, and playing an important role in the development of jazz, hip-hop, rock, and punk music. The rapid growth of Detroit in its boom years resulted in a globally unique stock of architectural monuments and historic places. Since the 2000s conservation efforts have managed to save many architectural pieces and achieved several large-scale revitalizations, including the restoration of several historic theatres and entertainment venues, high-rise renovations, new sports stadiums, and a riverfront revitalization project. More recently, the population of Downtown Detroit, Midtown Detroit, and various other neighborhoods has increased. An increasingly popular tourist destination, Detroit receives 19 million visitors per year. In 2015, Detroit was named a ""City of Design"" by UNESCO, the first U.S. city to receive that designation.","wikipedia","5.5"

The word literally means ""protected person"", referring to the state's obligation under sharia to protect the individual's life, property, and freedom of religion, in exchange for loyalty to the state and payment of the jizya tax, which complemented the zakat, or obligatory alms, paid by the Muslim subjects. Dhimmis were exempt from certain duties assigned specifically to Muslims, and did not enjoy certain privileges and freedoms reserved for Muslims, but were otherwise equal under the laws of property, contract, and obligation.Under sharia, the dhimmi communities were usually governed by their own laws in place of some of the laws applicable to the Muslim community. For example, the Jewish community in Medina was allowed to have its own Halakhic courts, and the Ottoman millet system allowed its various dhimmi communities to rule themselves under separate legal courts. These courts did not cover cases that involved religious groups outside of their own community, or capital offences. Dhimmi communities were also allowed to engage in certain practices that were usually forbidden for the Muslim community, such as the consumption of alcohol and pork.Historically, dhimmi status was originally applied to Jews, Christians, and Sabians. This status later also came to be applied to Zoroastrians, Hindus, Jains and Buddhists.Moderate Muslims generally reject the dhimma system as inappropriate for the age of nation-states and democracies. There is a range of opinions among 20th century and contemporary theologians about whether the notion of dhimma is appropriate for modern times, and, if so, what form it should take in an Islamic state.","wikipedia","5.1"

The franchise focuses on the eponymous creatures, who inhabit a ""Digital World"", a parallel universe that originated from Earth's various communication networks.\nThe franchise was created in 1997 as a series of virtual pets, akin to\u2014and influenced in style by\u2014the contemporary Tamagotchi or nano Giga Pet toys. The creatures were first designed to look cute and iconic even on the devices' small screens; later developments had them created with a harder-edged style influenced by American comics. The franchise gained momentum with its first anime incarnation, Digimon Adventure, and an early video game, Digimon World, both released in 1999. Several anime series and films based on them have been released, and the video game series has expanded into genres such as role-playing, racing, fighting, and MMORPGs.","wikipedia","5.13"
"3.189","Digital rights management","","Digital rights management (DRM) tools or technological protection measures (TPM) are a set of access control technologies for restricting the use of proprietary hardware and copyrighted works. DRM technologies try to control the use, modification, and distribution of copyrighted works (such as software and multimedia content), as well as systems within devices that enforce these policies.The use of digital rights management is not universally accepted. Proponents of DRM argue that it is necessary to prevent intellectual property from being copied freely, just as physical locks are needed to prevent personal property from being stolen, that it can help the copyright holder maintain artistic control, and that it can ensure continued revenue streams. Those opposed to DRM contend there is no evidence that DRM helps prevent copyright infringement, arguing instead that it serves only to inconvenience legitimate customers, and that DRM helps big business stifle innovation and competition. Furthermore, works can become permanently inaccessible if the DRM scheme changes or if the service is discontinued. DRM can also restrict users from exercising their legal rights under the copyright law, such as backing up copies of CDs or DVDs (instead having to buy another copy, if it can still be purchased), lending materials out through a library, accessing works in the public domain, or using copyrighted materials for research and education under the fair use doctrine.Worldwide, many laws have been created which criminalize the circumvention of DRM, communication about such circumvention, and the creation and distribution of tools used for such circumvention. Such laws are part of the United States' Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and the European Union's Information Society Directive, (the French DADVSI is an example of a member state of the European Union (""EU"") implementing the directive).","wikipedia","5.4"
"3.190","Digital television","","Digital television (DTV) is the transmission of television audiovisual signals using digital encoding, in contrast to the earlier analog television technology which used analog signals. At the time of its development it was considered an innovative advancement and represented the first significant evolution in television technology since color television in the 1950s. Modern digital television is transmitted in high definition (HDTV) with greater resolution than analog TV. It typically uses a widescreen aspect ratio (commonly 16:9) in contrast to the narrower format of analog TV. It makes more economical use of scarce radio spectrum space; it can transmit up to seven channels in the same bandwidth as a single analog channel, and provides many new features that analog television cannot. A transition from analog to digital broadcasting began around 2000. Different digital television broadcasting standards have been adopted in different parts of the world; below are the more widely used standards:\n\nDigital Video Broadcasting (DVB) uses coded orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation and supports hierarchical transmission. This standard has been adopted in Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia, for a total of approximately 60 countries.\nAdvanced Television System Committee (ATSC) uses eight-level vestigial sideband (8VSB) for terrestrial broadcasting. This standard has been adopted by 6 countries: the United States, Canada, Mexico, South Korea, the Dominican Republic and Honduras.\nIntegrated Services Digital Broadcasting (ISDB) is a system designed to provide good reception to fixed receivers and also portable or mobile receivers. It utilizes OFDM and two-dimensional interleaving. It supports hierarchical transmission of up to three layers and uses MPEG-2 video and Advanced Audio Coding. This standard has been adopted in Japan and the Philippines. ISDB-T International is an adaptation of this standard using H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, which has been adopted in most of South America and Portuguese-speaking African countries.\nDigital Terrestrial Multimedia Broadcasting (DTMB) adopts time-domain synchronous (TDS) OFDM technology with a pseudo-random signal frame to serve as the guard interval (GI) of the OFDM block and the training symbol. The DTMB standard has been adopted in the People's Republic of China, including Hong Kong and Macau.\nDigital Multimedia Broadcasting (DMB) is a digital radio transmission technology developed in South Korea as part of the national IT project for sending multimedia such as TV, radio and datacasting to mobile devices such as mobile phones, laptops and GPS navigation systems.","wikipedia","5.13"
"3.191","Disability","","A disability is any condition that makes it more difficult for a person to do certain activities or interact with the world around them. These conditions, or impairments, may be cognitive, developmental, intellectual, mental, physical, sensory, or a combination of multiple factors. Impairments causing disability may be present from birth or occur during a person's lifetime. The World Health Organization proposes the following definition of disabilities:\n\n""Disabilities is an umbrella term, covering impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions. An impairment is a problem in body function or structure; an activity limitation is a difficulty encountered by an individual in executing a task or action; while a participation restriction is a problem experienced by an individual in involvement in life situations. Disability is thus not just a health problem. It is a complex phenomenon, reflecting the interaction between features of a person\u2019s body and features of the society in which he or she lives.""\nDisability is a contested concept, with different meanings in different communities. The term disability may be used to refer to physical or mental attributes that some institutions, particularly medicine, view as needing to be fixed (the medical model); it may also refer to limitations imposed on people by the constraints of an ableist society (the social model); or the term may serve to refer to the identity of disabled people. Physiological functional capacity (PFC) is a measure of an individual's performance level that gauges one's ability to perform the physical tasks of daily life and the ease with which these tasks are performed. PFC declines with advancing age to result in frailty, cognitive disorders, or physical disorders, all of which may lead to labeling individuals as disabled.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.192","Disc jockey","","A disc jockey, more commonly abbreviated as DJ, is a person who hosts recorded music for an audience. Most common types of DJs include radio DJs, club DJs, who perform at a nightclub or music festival and turntablists who use record players, usually turntables, to manipulate sounds on phonograph records. Originally, the ""disc"" in ""disc jockey"" referred to vinyl records, but nowadays DJ is used as an all-encompassing term to also describe persons who mix music from other recording media such as cassettes, CDs or digital audio files on a CDJ or a laptop. The title ""DJ"" is often used by DJs in front of their real names, adopted pseudonyms, or stage names.\nDJs use audio equipment that can play at least two sources of recorded music simultaneously and mix them together to create seamless transitions between recordings and develop unique mixes of songs. Often, this involves aligning the beats of the music sources so their rhythms and tempos do not clash when played together and to enable a smooth transition from one song to another. DJs often use specialized DJ mixers, small audio mixers with crossfader and cue functions to blend or transition from one song to another. Mixers are also used to pre-listen to sources of recorded music in headphones and adjust upcoming tracks to mix with currently playing music. DJ software can be used with a DJ controller device to mix audio files on a computer instead of a console mixer. DJs may also use a microphone to speak to the audience; effects units such as reverb to create sound effects and electronic musical instruments such as drum machines and synthesizers.","wikipedia","5.12"
"3.193","Disco","","Disco is a genre of dance music and a subculture that emerged in the 1970s from the United States' urban nightlife scene.\nThe disco sound is typified by ""four-on-the-floor"" beats, syncopated basslines, and string sections, horns, electric piano, synthesizers, and electric rhythm guitars. Lead guitar features less frequently in disco than in rock. Well-known disco artists include Donna Summer, Gloria Gaynor, the Bee Gees, Chic, KC and the Sunshine Band, Thelma Houston, Sister Sledge, the Trammps, Village People and Michael Jackson. While performers and singers garnered public attention, record producers working behind the scenes played an important role in developing the genre. Films such as Saturday Night Fever (1977) and Thank God It's Friday (1978) contributed to disco's mainstream popularity.\nDisco started as a mixture of music from venues popular with African Americans, Hispanic and Latino Americans, Italian Americans, and LGBT peoplein Philadelphia and New York City during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Disco can be seen as a reaction by the counterculture during this period to both the dominance of rock music and the stigmatization of dance music at the time. Several dance styles were developed during the period of disco's popularity in the United States, including \u201cthe Bump\u201d and \u201cthe Hustle\u201d.\nBy the late \u201870s, most major U.S. cities had thriving disco club scenes, and DJs would mix dance records at clubs such as Studio 54 in New York City, a venue popular among celebrities. Discoth\u00e8que-goers often wore expensive, extravagant and sexy fashions. There was also a thriving drug subculture in the disco scene, particularly for drugs that would enhance the experience of dancing to the loud music and the flashing lights, such as cocaine and Quaaludes, the latter being so common in disco subculture that they were nicknamed ""disco biscuits"". Disco clubs were also associated with promiscuity as a reflection of the sexual revolution of this era in popular history.\nDisco was the last popular music movement driven by the baby boom generation. It began to decline in the United States during 1979-80, and by 1982 it had lost nearly all popularity there. Disco Demolition Night, an anti-disco protest held in Chicago on July 12, 1979, remains the most well-known of several ""backlash"" incidents across the country that symbolized disco's declining fortune.\nDisco was a key influence in the development of electronic dance music and house music. It has had several revivals, such as Madonna's highly successful 2005 album Confessions on a Dance Floor, and more recently in the 2010s, entering the pop charts in the US and the UK.","wikipedia","5.13"
"3.194","Divorce","","Divorce, also known as dissolution of marriage, is the process of terminating a marriage or marital union. Divorce usually entails the canceling or reorganizing of the legal duties and responsibilities of marriage, thus dissolving the bonds of matrimony between a married couple under the rule of law of the particular country or state. Divorce laws vary considerably around the world, but in most countries divorce requires the sanction of a court or other authority in a legal process, which may involve issues of distribution of property, child custody, alimony (spousal support), child visitation / access, parenting time, child support, and division of debt. In most countries, monogamy is required by law, so divorce allows each former partner to marry another person.\nWhen those that are in a common-law relationship break up, it is referred to as separation, instead of a divorce.Divorce is different from annulment, which declares the marriage null and void, with legal separation or de jure separation (a legal process by which a married couple may formalize a de facto separation while remaining legally married) or with de facto separation (a process where the spouses informally stop cohabiting). Reasons for divorce vary, from sexual incompatibility or lack of independence for one or both spouses to a personality clash.The only countries that do not allow divorce are the Philippines, the Vatican City and the British Crown Dependency of Sark. In the Philippines, divorce for non-Muslim Filipinos is not legal unless the husband or wife is an alien and satisfies certain conditions. The Vatican City is an ecclesiastical state, which has no procedure for divorce. Countries that have relatively recently legalized divorce are Italy (1970), Portugal (1975), Brazil (1977), Spain (1981), Argentina (1987), Paraguay (1991), Colombia (1991*), Andorra (1995), Ireland (1996), Chile (2004) and Malta (2011).","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.176","DNA paternity testing","","DNA paternity testing is the use of DNA profiles to determine whether an individual is the biological parent of another individual. Paternity testing can be especially important when the rights and duties of the father are in issue and a child's paternity is in doubt. Tests can also determine the likelihood of someone being a biological grandparent. Though genetic testing is the most reliable standard, older methods also exist, including ABO blood group typing, analysis of various other proteins and enzymes, or using human leukocyte antigen antigens. The current techniques for paternity testing are using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Paternity testing can now also be performed while the woman is still pregnant from a blood draw.DNA testing is currently the most advanced and accurate technology to determine parentage. In a DNA paternity test, the result (called the 'probability of parentage) is 0% when the alleged parent is not biologically related to the child, and the probability of parentage is typically 99.99% when the alleged parent is biologically related to the child. However, while almost all individuals have a single and distinct set of genes, rare individuals, known as ""chimeras"", have at least two different sets of genes, which can result in a false negative result if their reproductive tissue has a different genetic make-up from the tissue sampled for the test.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.195","Domestic violence","","Domestic violence (also named domestic abuse or family violence) is violence or other abuse in a domestic setting, such as in marriage or cohabitation. Domestic violence may be used as a synonym for intimate partner violence, which is committed by a spouse or partner in an intimate relationship against the other spouse or partner, and can take place in heterosexual or same-sex relationships, or between former spouses or partners. In the broadest sense, domestic violence can also involve violence against children, parents, or the elderly. It takes a number of forms, including physical, verbal, emotional, economic, religious, reproductive, and sexual abuse, which can range from subtle, coercive forms to marital rape and to violent physical abuse such as choking, beating, female genital mutilation, and acid throwing that results in disfigurement or death. Domestic murders include stoning, bride burning, honor killings, and dowry deaths (which sometimes involve non-cohabitating family members).\nGlobally, the victims of domestic violence are overwhelmingly women, and women tend to experience more severe forms of violence. They are also likelier than men to use intimate partner violence in self-defense. In some countries, domestic violence is often seen as justified, particularly in cases of actual or suspected infidelity on the part of the woman, and is legally permitted. Research has established that there exists a direct and significant correlation between a country's level of gender equality and rates of domestic violence, where countries with less gender equality experience higher rates of domestic violence. Domestic violence is among the most underreported crimes worldwide for both men and women. Due to social stigmas regarding male victimization, men who are victims of domestic violence face an increased likelihood of being overlooked by healthcare providers.Domestic violence often occurs when the abuser believes that abuse is an entitlement, acceptable, justified, or unlikely to be reported. It may produce an intergenerational cycle of abuse in children and other family members, who may feel that such violence is acceptable or condoned. Many people do not recognize themselves as abusers or victims because they may consider their experiences as family conflicts that got out of control. Awareness, perception, definition and documentation of domestic violence differs widely from country to country. Domestic violence often happens in the context of forced or child marriage.In abusive relationships, there may be a cycle of abuse during which tensions rise and an act of violence is committed, followed by a period of reconciliation and calm. Victims of domestic violence may be trapped in domestic violent situations through isolation, power and control, traumatic bonding to the abuser, cultural acceptance, lack of financial resources, fear, shame, or to protect children. As a result of abuse, victims may experience physical disabilities, dysregulated aggression, chronic health problems, mental illness, limited finances, and a poor ability to create healthy relationships. Victims may experience severe psychological disorders, such as posttraumatic stress disorder. Children who live in a household with violence often show psychological problems from an early age, such as avoidance, hypervigilance to threats, and dysregulated aggression which may contribute to vicarious traumatization.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.196","Dorje Shugden","","Dorje Shugden (Standard Tibetan: \u0f62\u0fa1\u0f7c\u0f0b\u0f62\u0f97\u0f7a\u0f0b\u0f64\u0f74\u0f42\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f63\u0fa1\u0f53\u0f0b, Tibetan pronunciation: [to\u02d0t\u0255e \u0255ukt\u025b\u0303]), also known as Dolgyal and as Gyalchen Shugden, is an entity associated with the Gelug school, the newest of the schools of Tibetan Buddhism. Dorje Shugden is variously looked upon as a destroyed gyalpo, a minor mundane protector, a major mundane protector, an enlightened major protector whose outward appearance is that of a gyalpo, or as an enlightened major protector whose outward appearance is enlightened.\nThe Dorje Shugden controversy arose within all schools of Tibetan Buddhism, including the Gelug school itself, regarding Dorje Shugden's nature, status of enlightenment, differences from traditional Gelug teachings, replacement of traditional Gelug protectors, sectarian functions, and actions by western adherents of the New Kadampa Tradition.","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.197","Dorje Shugden controversy","","The Dorje Shugden controversy is a controversy over Dorje Shugden, also known as Dolgyal, who some consider to be one of several protectors of the Gelug school, the school of Tibetan Buddhism to which the Dalai Lamas belong. Dorje Shugden has become the symbolic centre-point of a conflict over the ""purity"" of the Gelug school and the inclusion of non-Gelug teachings, especially Nyingma ones.\nIn the 1930s, Pabongkhapa D\u00e9chen Nyingpo, who favoured an ""exclusive"" stance, started to promote Shugden as a major protector of the Gelug school, who harms any Gelug practitioner who blends his practice with non-Gelug practices. The conflict reappeared with the publication of the Yellow Book in 1976, containing stories about wrathful acts of Dorje Shugden against Gelugpas who also practiced Nyingma teachings. In response, the 14th Dalai Lama, a Gelugpa himself and advocate of an ""inclusive"" approach to the teachings of Tibetan Buddhism, started to speak out against the practice of Dorje Shugden in 1978.The controversy has attracted attention in the west following demonstrations by Dorje Shugden practitioners, especially Kelsang Gyatso's British based New Kadampa Tradition, which broke away from the Gelug school in 1991. Other factions supporting Dorje Shugden are Serpom Monastic University and Shar Ganden monastery, both of which separated from the Gelug mainstream in 2008.","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.198","Double jeopardy","","Double jeopardy is a procedural defence that prevents an accused person from being tried again on the same (or similar) charges following a valid acquittal or conviction.If this issue is raised, evidence will be placed before the court, which will normally rule as a preliminary matter whether the plea is substantiated; if it is, the projected trial will be prevented from proceeding. In some countries certain exemptions are permitted, such as in the United Kingdom, where in Scotland a new trial can be initiated if, for example, the acquitted has made a credible admission of guilt, and in England and Wales, where serious offences may be re-tried following an acquittal if new and compelling evidence is found and for the trial to be in the public's interest. In some countries, including Canada, Mexico and the United States, the guarantee against being ""twice put in jeopardy"" is a constitutional right. In other countries, the protection is afforded by statute.In common law countries, a defendant may enter a peremptory plea of autrefois acquit (formerly acquitted) or autrefois convict (formerly convicted), with the same effect.The doctrine appears to have originated in Roman law, in the principle non bis in idem (""an issue once decided must not be raised again"").","wikipedia","5.0"
"3.199","Drawn Together","","Drawn Together is an American adult animated television series that ran on Comedy Central from October 27, 2004 to November 14, 2007. The series was created by Dave Jeser and Matt Silverstein, and uses a sitcom format with a reality TV show setting.\nThe show's eight characters are a combination of personalities that were recognizable and familiar prior to the series. Differently, however, Drawn Together used caricatures of established cartoon characters and stock characters. In addition, their character traits parody personality types that are typically seen in reality TV shows.\nComedy Central advertised it as the first animated reality TV series, and in some episodes, the characters participate in challenges that are similar to reality TV challenges, although the premise is largely dropped in later seasons.\nAfter three seasons, the show was cancelled. Subsequently, a direct-to-video film and series finale, The Drawn Together Movie: The Movie! was released on April 20, 2010.","wikipedia","5.13"
"3.200","Drug","","A drug () is any substance that causes a change in an organism's physiology or psychology when consumed. Drugs are typically distinguished from food and substances that provide nutritional support. Consumption of drugs can be via inhalation, injection, smoking, ingestion, absorption via a patch on the skin, or dissolution under the tongue.\nIn pharmacology, a drug is a chemical substance, typically of known structure, which, when administered to a living organism, produces a biological effect. A pharmaceutical drug, also called a medication or medicine, is a chemical substance used to treat, cure, prevent, or diagnose a disease or to promote well-being. Traditionally drugs were obtained through extraction from medicinal plants, but more recently also by organic synthesis. Pharmaceutical drugs may be used for a limited duration, or on a regular basis for chronic disorders.Pharmaceutical drugs are often classified into drug classes\u2014groups of related drugs that have similar chemical structures, the same mechanism of action (binding to the same biological target), a related mode of action, and that are used to treat the same disease. The Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System (ATC), the most widely used drug classification system, assigns drugs a unique ATC code, which is an alphanumeric code that assigns it to specific drug classes within the ATC system. Another major classification system is the Biopharmaceutics Classification System. This classifies drugs according to their solubility and permeability or absorption properties.Psychoactive drugs are chemical substances that affect the function of the central nervous system, altering perception, mood or consciousness. These drugs are divided into different groups like: stimulants, depressants, antidepressants, anxiolytics, antipsychotics, and hallucinogens. These psychoactive drugs have been proven useful in treating wide range of medical conditions including mental disorders around the world. The most widely used drugs in the world include caffeine, nicotine and alcohol, which are also considered recreational drugs, since they are used for pleasure rather than medicinal purposes. Abuse of several psychoactive drugs can cause psychological or physical addiction. It's worth noting that all drugs can have potential side effects. Excessive use of stimulants can promote stimulant psychosis. Many recreational drugs are illicit and international treaties such as the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs exist for the purpose of their prohibition.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.201","Druze","","The Druze (; Arabic: \u062f\u0631\u0632\u064a\u200e darz\u012b or durz\u012b, plural \u062f\u0631\u0648\u0632 dur\u016bz; Hebrew: \u05d3\u05b0\u05bc\u05e8\u05d5\u05bc\u05d6\u05b4\u05d9 dr\u016bz\u012b plural \u05d3\u05b0\u05bc\u05e8\u05d5\u05bc\u05d6\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd, druzim) are an Arabic-speaking esoteric ethno-religious group originating in Western Asia who self-identify as Al-Muwa\u1e25\u1e25id\u016bn (lit., ""The People of Monotheism""). Jethro of Midian is considered an ancestor of Druze, who revere him as their spiritual founder and chief prophet. It is a monotheistic and Abrahamic religion based on the teachings of Hamza ibn-'Ali ibn-Ahmad and the sixth Fatimid caliph Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, and Greek philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, Pythagoras, and Zeno of Citium.The Epistles of Wisdom is the foundational text of the Druze faith. The Druze faith incorporates elements of Isma'ilism, a branch of Shia Islam, Gnosticism, Hinduism, Neoplatonism, Pythagoreanism, and other philosophies and beliefs, creating a distinct and secretive theology, based on an esoteric interpretation of scripture, which emphasises the role of the mind and truthfulness. Druze believe in theophany and reincarnation, or the transmigration of the soul. Druze believe that at the end of the cycle of rebirth, which is achieved through successive reincarnations, the soul is united with the Cosmic Mind (al-\u02bfAql al-kull\u012b).Although dwarfed by other, larger communities, the Druze community played an important role in shaping the history of the Levant, where it continues to play a large political role. As a religious minority in every country in which they are found, they have frequently experienced persecution, except in Lebanon and Israel, where Druze judges, parliamentarians, diplomats, and doctors occupy the highest echelons of society. Even though the faith originally developed out of Ismaili Islam, Druze are not generally considered Muslims, although Al Azhar of Egypt recognizes them as one of the Islamic sects, akin to Shia. Fatimid caliph Ali az-Zahir, whose father al-Hakim is a key figure in the Druze faith, was particularly harsh to Druze, causing the death of many in Antioch, Aleppo, and northern Syria. Persecution flared up during the rule of the Mamluks and Ottomans. Most recently, Druze were targeted by the ISIL and Al-Qaeda whose goal was to remove from Syria and neighboring countries what they saw as non-Islamic influences.The Druze faith is one of the major religious groups in the Levant, with between 800,000 and a million adherents. They are found primarily in Syria, Lebanon (where the Druze are considered part of their Muslim population), and Israel, with small communities in Jordan. The oldest and most densely-populated Druze communities exist in Mount Lebanon and in the south of Syria around Jabal al-Druze (literally the ""Mountain of the Druzes""). The Druze's social customs differ markedly from those of Muslims or Christians, and they are known to form close-knit, cohesive communities which do not fully allow non-Druze in, though they themselves integrate fully in their adopted homelands.","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.202","Duke Nukem Forever","","Duke Nukem Forever is a first-person shooter video game for Windows, OS X, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. It is a sequel to the 1996 game Duke Nukem 3D as part of the long-running Duke Nukem series. Duke Nukem Forever entered development in 1997 at 3D Realms and Triptych Games and was finished by Gearbox Software and Piranha Games in 2011. In the game, the player controls Duke Nukem, an action hero who must come out of retirement and save the world from aliens when they begin kidnapping the women of Earth.   \nDuke Nukem Forever was originally announced in 1997 as the follow up to Duke Nukem 3D, but became a notable example of vaporware due to its severely protracted development schedule, which saw the game being delayed numerous times and had 3D Realms, which was being underfunded and laying off staff in 2009, become involved in a lawsuit with publisher Take-Two Interactive. In 2010, Gearbox took over the game's development and finished the game on behalf of 3D Realms. Finally released on June 14, 2011, Duke Nukem Forever earned mostly negative reviews from critics, who criticized the graphics, dated humor and story, simplistic mechanics, and unpolished performance and design.","wikipedia","5.12"
"3.203","Dust Bowl","","The Dust Bowl was a period of severe dust storms that greatly damaged the ecology and agriculture of the American and Canadian prairies during the 1930s; severe drought and a failure to apply dryland farming methods to prevent  the aeolian processes (wind erosion) caused the phenomenon. The drought came in three waves, 1934, 1936, and 1939\u20131940, but some regions of the high plains experienced drought conditions for as many as eight years.With insufficient understanding of the ecology of the plains, farmers had conducted extensive deep plowing of the virgin topsoil of the Great Plains during the previous decade; this had displaced the native, deep-rooted grasses that normally trapped soil and moisture even during periods of drought and high winds.  The rapid mechanization of farm equipment, especially small gasoline tractors, and widespread use of the combine harvester contributed to farmers' decisions to convert arid grassland (much of which received no more than 10 inches (~250 mm) of precipitation per year) to cultivated cropland. During the drought of the 1930s, the unanchored soil turned to dust, which the prevailing winds blew away in huge clouds that sometimes blackened the sky.  These choking billows of dust \u2013 named ""black blizzards"" or ""black rollers"" \u2013 traveled cross country, reaching as far as the East Coast and striking such cities as New York City and Washington, D.C. On the plains, they often reduced visibility to 3 feet (1 m) or less. Associated Press reporter Robert E. Geiger happened to be in Boise City, Oklahoma, to witness the ""Black Sunday"" black blizzards of April 14, 1935; Edward Stanley, Kansas City news editor of the Associated Press coined the term ""Dust Bowl"" while rewriting Geiger's news story.While the term ""the Dust Bowl"" was originally a reference to the geographical area affected by the dust, today it usually refers to the event itself (the term ""Dirty Thirties"" is also sometimes used).The drought and erosion of the Dust Bowl affected 100,000,000 acres (400,000 km2) that centered on the panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma and touched adjacent sections of New Mexico, Colorado, and Kansas. The Dust Bowl forced tens of thousands of poverty-stricken families to abandon their farms, unable to pay mortgages or grow crops, and losses reached $25 million per day by 1936 (equivalent to $460,000,000 in 2019). Many of these families, who were often known as ""Okies"" because so many of them came from Oklahoma, migrated to California and other states to find that the Great Depression had rendered economic conditions there little better than those they had left.\nThe Dust Bowl has been the subject of many cultural works, notably the novel The Grapes of Wrath (1939) by John Steinbeck, the folk music of Woody Guthrie, and photographs  depicting the conditions of migrants by Dorothea Lange.","wikipedia","5.9"
"3.204","Dyslexia","","Dyslexia, also known as reading disorder, is characterized by trouble with reading despite normal intelligence. Different people are affected to varying degrees. Problems may include difficulties in spelling words, reading quickly, writing words, ""sounding out"" words in the head, pronouncing words when reading aloud and understanding what one reads. Often these difficulties are first noticed at school. When someone who previously could read loses their ability, it is known as ""alexia"". The difficulties are involuntary and people with this disorder have a normal desire to learn. People with dyslexia have higher rates of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), developmental language disorders, and difficulties with numbers.Dyslexia is believed to be caused by the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. Some cases run in families. Dyslexia that develops due to a traumatic brain injury, stroke, or dementia is called ""acquired dyslexia"". The underlying mechanisms of dyslexia are problems within the brain's language processing. Dyslexia is diagnosed through a series of tests of memory, vision, spelling, and reading skills. Dyslexia is separate from reading difficulties caused by hearing or vision problems or by insufficient teaching or opportunity to learn.Treatment involves adjusting teaching methods to meet the person's needs. While not curing the underlying problem, it may decrease the degree or impact of symptoms. Treatments targeting vision are not effective. Dyslexia is the most common learning disability and occurs in all areas of the world. It affects 3\u20137% of the population, however, up to 20% of the general population may have some degree of symptoms.  While dyslexia is more often diagnosed in men, it has been suggested that it affects men and women equally. Some believe that dyslexia should be best considered as a different way of learning, with both benefits and downsides.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.206","Eastern Orthodoxy","","The Eastern Orthodox Church, officially the Orthodox Catholic Church, is the second-largest Christian church, with approximately 260 million baptised members. It operates as a communion of autocephalous churches, each governed by its bishops in local synods. Roughly half of Eastern Orthodox Christians live in Russia. The church has no central doctrinal or governmental authority analogous to the Bishop of Rome, but the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople is recognised by all as primus inter pares (""first among equals"") of the bishops. As one of the oldest surviving religious institutions in the world, the Eastern Orthodox Church has played a prominent role in the history and culture of Eastern and Southeastern Europe, the Caucasus, and the Near East.Eastern Orthodox theology is based on the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed (known simply as the Nicene Creed). The church teaches that it is the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic church established by Jesus Christ in his Great Commission, and that its bishops are the successors of Christ's apostles. It maintains that it practices the original Christian faith, as passed down by holy tradition. Its patriarchates, reminiscent of the pentarchy, and autocephalous and autonomous churches reflect a variety of hierarchical organisation. It recognises seven major sacraments, of which the Eucharist is the principal one, celebrated liturgically in synaxis. The church teaches that through consecration invoked by a priest, the sacrificial bread and wine become the body and blood of Christ. The Virgin Mary is venerated in the Eastern Orthodox Church as the God-bearer, honoured in devotions.\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church shared communion with the Roman Catholic Church in the State Church of Rome until the East\u2013West Schism in 1054, disputing particularly the authority of the Pope. Before the Council of Ephesus in AD 431 the Church of the East also shared in this communion, as did the Oriental Orthodox Churches before the Council of Chalcedon in AD 451, all separating primarily over differences in Christology.\nThe majority of Eastern Orthodox Christians live mainly in Southeast and Eastern Europe, Cyprus, Georgia and other communities in the Caucasus region, and communities in Siberia reaching the Russian Far East. There are also smaller communities in the former Byzantine regions of Africa, the Eastern Mediterranean, and in the Middle East where it is decreasing due to forced migration because of increased religious persecution in recent years. There are also many in other parts of the world, formed through diaspora, conversions, and missionary activity.","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.205","East Germany","","East Germany, officially the German Democratic Republic (GDR; German: Deutsche Demokratische Republik [\u02c8d\u0254\u028ft\u0283\u0259 demo\u02c8k\u0281a\u02d0t\u026a\u0283\u0259 \u0281epu\u02c8bli\u02d0k], DDR), was a state that existed from 1949 to 1990, the period when the eastern portion of Germany was part of the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War. Commonly described as a communist state in English usage, it described itself as a socialist ""workers' and peasants' state"". It consisted of territory that was administered and occupied by Soviet forces following the end of World War II\u2014the Soviet occupation zone of the Potsdam Agreement, bounded on the east by the Oder\u2013Neisse line. The Soviet zone surrounded West Berlin but did not include it; as a result, West Berlin remained outside the jurisdiction of the GDR.\nThe German Democratic Republic was established in the Soviet zone, while the Federal Republic was established in the three western zones. East Germany was a satellite state of the Soviet Union. Soviet occupation authorities began transferring administrative responsibility to German communist leaders in 1948, and the GDR began to function as a state on 7 October 1949. However, Soviet forces remained in the country throughout the Cold War. Until 1989, the GDR was governed by the Socialist Unity Party (SED), though other parties nominally participated in its alliance organisation, the National Front. The SED made the teaching of Marxism\u2013Leninism and the Russian language compulsory in schools.The economy was centrally planned and increasingly state-owned. Prices of housing, basic goods and services were set by central government planners rather than rising and falling through supply and demand; and were heavily subsidised. Although the GDR had to pay substantial war reparations to the Soviets, it became the most successful economy in the Eastern Bloc. Emigration to the West was a significant problem\u2014as many of the emigrants were well-educated young people, it further weakened the state economically. The government fortified its western borders and, in 1961, built the Berlin Wall. Many people attempting to flee were killed by border guards or booby traps, such as landmines. Many others spent large amounts of time imprisoned for attempting to escape.In 1989, numerous social, economic, and political forces in the GDR and abroad led to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the establishment of a government committed to liberalisation. The following year, free and fair elections were held, and international negotiations led to the signing of the Final Settlement treaty on the status and borders of Germany. The GDR dissolved itself, and Germany was reunified on 3 October 1990, becoming a fully sovereign state again. Several of the GDR's leaders, notably its last communist leader Egon Krenz, were prosecuted after reunification for crimes committed during the Cold War.\nGeographically, the German Democratic Republic bordered the Baltic Sea to the north; Poland to the east; Czechoslovakia to the southeast and West Germany to the southwest and west. Internally, the GDR also bordered the Soviet sector of Allied-occupied Berlin, known as East Berlin, which was also administered as the state's de facto capital. It also bordered the three sectors occupied by the United States, United Kingdom and France known collectively as West Berlin. The three sectors occupied by the Western nations were sealed off from the GDR by the Berlin Wall from its construction in 1961 until it was brought down in 1989.\n\n","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.207","Ebola","","Ebola virus disease (EVD), also known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever (EHF) or simply Ebola, is a viral haemorrhagic fever of humans and other primates caused by ebolaviruses. Signs and symptoms typically start between two days and three weeks after contracting the virus with a fever, sore throat, muscular pain, and headaches. Vomiting, diarrhoea and rash usually follow, along with decreased function of the liver and kidneys. At this time, some people begin to bleed both internally and externally. The disease has a high risk of death, killing 25% to 90% of those infected, with an average of about 50%. This is often due to low blood pressure from fluid loss, and typically follows 6 to 16 days after symptoms appear.The virus spreads through direct contact with body fluids, such as blood from infected humans or other animals. Spread may also occur from contact with items recently contaminated with bodily fluids. Spread of the disease through the air between primates, including humans, has not been documented in either laboratory or natural conditions. Semen or breast milk of a person after recovery from EVD may carry the virus for several weeks to months. Fruit bats are believed to be the normal carrier in nature, able to spread the virus without being affected by it. Other diseases such as malaria, cholera, typhoid fever, meningitis and other viral haemorrhagic fevers may resemble EVD. Blood samples are tested for viral RNA, viral antibodies or for the virus itself to confirm the diagnosis.Control of outbreaks requires coordinated medical services and community engagement. This includes rapid detection, contact tracing of those who have been exposed, quick access to laboratory services, care for those infected, and proper disposal of the dead through cremation or burial. Samples of body fluids and tissues from people with the disease should be handled with special caution. Prevention includes limiting the spread of disease from infected animals to humans by handling potentially infected bushmeat only while wearing protective clothing, and by thoroughly cooking bushmeat before eating it. It also includes wearing proper protective clothing and washing hands when around a person with the disease. An Ebola vaccine was approved in the United States in December 2019. While there is no approved treatment for Ebola as of 2019, two treatments (REGN-EB3 and mAb114) are associated with improved outcomes. Supportive efforts also improve outcomes. This includes either oral rehydration therapy (drinking slightly sweetened and salty water) or giving intravenous fluids as well as treating symptoms.The disease was first identified in 1976, in two simultaneous outbreaks: one in Nzara (a town in South Sudan) and the other in Yambuku (Democratic Republic of the Congo), a village near the Ebola River from which the disease takes its name. EVD outbreaks occur intermittently in tropical regions of sub-Saharan Africa. Between 1976 and 2013, the World Health Organization reports 24 outbreaks involving 2,387 cases with 1,590 deaths. The largest outbreak to date was the epidemic in West Africa, which occurred from December 2013, to January 2016, with 28,646 cases and 11,323 deaths. It was declared no longer an emergency on 29 March 2016. Other outbreaks in Africa began in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in May 2017, and 2018. In July 2019, the World Health Organization declared the Congo Ebola outbreak a world health emergency.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.208","Ebonics (word)","","Ebonics (a portmanteau of the words ebony and phonics) is a term that was originally intended to refer to the language of all people descended from enslaved Black Africans, particularly in West Africa, the Caribbean, and North America. Since the 1996 controversy over its use by the Oakland School Board, the term Ebonics has primarily been used to refer to the sociolect African American English, a dialect distinctively different from Standard American English.","wikipedia","5.10"
"3.209","Eckankar","","Eckankar is a religion founded by Paul Twitchell in 1965. It is a non-profit religious group with members in over one hundred countries. The spiritual home is the Temple of Eck in Chanhassen, Minnesota. Eckankar is not affiliated with any other religious group.\nThe movement teaches simple spiritual exercises, such as singing ""Hu"", called ""a love song to God"", to experience the Light and Sound of God and recognize the presence of the Holy Spirit.","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.211","Ecofascism","","Ecofascism is a theoretical political model in which an authoritarian government would require individuals to sacrifice their own interests to the ""organic whole of nature"".Some writers have used it to refer to the hypothetical danger of future dystopian governments, which might resort to fascist policies in order to deal with environmental issues. Other writers have used it to refer to segments of historical and modern fascist movements that focused on environmental issues.","wikipedia","5.9"
"3.212","Economy of Japan","","The economy of Japan is a highly developed free-market economy. It is the third-largest in the world by nominal GDP and the fourth-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP). and is the world's second largest developed economy. Japan is a member of the G7. According to the International Monetary Fund, the country's per capita GDP (PPP) was at $38,937(2016). Due to a volatile currency exchange rate, Japan's GDP as measured in dollars fluctuates sharply. Accounting for these fluctuations through the use of the Atlas method, Japan is estimated to have a GDP per capita of around $38,490. The Japanese economy is forecast by the Quarterly Tankan survey of business sentiment conducted by the Bank of Japan. The Nikkei 225 presents the monthly report of top blue chip equities on Japan Exchange Group, which is the world's third-largest stock exchange by market capitalisation. In 2018, Japan was the world's fourth-largest importer and the fourth-largest exporter. It has the world's second-largest foreign-exchange reserves worth $1.3 trillion. It ranks 39th on Ease of doing business index and 5th on Global Competitiveness Report. Japan is also the world's third-largest consumer market.Japan is the world's third largest automobile manufacturing country, has the largest electronics goods industry, and is often ranked among the world's most innovative countries leading several measures of global patent filings. Facing increasing competition from China and South Korea, manufacturing in Japan today now focuses primarily on high-tech and precision goods, such as optical instruments, hybrid vehicles, and robotics. Besides the Kant\u014d region, the Kansai region is one of the leading industrial clusters and manufacturing centers for the Japanese economy. The size and industrial structure of cities in Japan have maintained tight regularities despite substantial churning of population and industries across cities overtime. Japan is the world's largest creditor nation. Japan generally runs an annual trade surplus and has a considerable net international investment surplus. As of 2010, Japan possesses 13.7% of the world's private financial assets (the third largest in the world) at an estimated $13.5 trillion. As of 2017, 51 of the Fortune Global 500 companies are based in Japan, down from 62 in 2013.Japan has the highest ratio of public debt to GDP of any developed nation, with national debt at 236% relative to GDP as of 2017. This debt is predominantly owned by Japanese nationals. The Japanese economy faces considerable challenges posed by a declining population, which peaked at 128 million in 2010 and has fallen to 126.5 million as of 2018. Projections suggest the population will continue to fall to potentially lower than 100 million by the middle of the 21st century.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.210","Eco-terrorism","","Eco-terrorism is an act of violence committed in support of ecological or environmental causes, against people or property.The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation defines eco-terrorism as ""...the use or threatened use of violence of a criminal nature against innocent victims or property by an environmentally-oriented, subnational group for environmental-political reasons, or aimed at an audience beyond the target, often of a symbolic nature."" The FBI credited eco-terrorists with US$200 million in property damage between 2003 and 2008. A majority of states in the US have introduced laws aimed at penalizing eco-terrorism.Eco-terrorism is a form of radical environmentalism that arose out of the same school of thought that brought about deep ecology, ecofeminism, social ecology, and bioregionalism. ""Eco-terrorism"" is a controversial term.Some ""eco-terrorists"" are people fighting to preserve their environment with the belief that they are preserving their existence. Examples of such ""ecoterrorists"" include tribal ethnic minorities such as the Waorani.\n\n","wikipedia","5.9"
"3.213","Efforts to impeach George W. Bush","","During the presidency of George W. Bush, several American politicians sought to either investigate Bush for possible impeachable offenses, or to bring actual impeachment charges on the floor of the United States House of Representatives Judiciary Committee. The most significant of these efforts occurred on June 10, 2008, when Congressman Dennis Kucinich, along with co-sponsor Robert Wexler, introduced 35 articles of impeachment against Bush to the U.S. House of Representatives. The House voted 251 to 166 to refer the impeachment resolution to the Judiciary Committee on June 11, where no further action was taken on it. Bush's presidency ended on January 20, 2009, with the completion of his second term in office, rendering impeachment efforts moot.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.214","Ejaculation","","Ejaculation is the discharge of semen (normally containing sperm) from the male reproductory tract, usually accompanied by orgasm. It is the final stage and natural objective of male sexual stimulation, and an essential component of natural conception. In rare cases, ejaculation occurs because of prostatic disease. Ejaculation may also occur spontaneously during sleep (a nocturnal emission or ""wet dream""). Anejaculation is the condition of being unable to ejaculate. Ejaculation is usually very pleasurable for men; dysejaculation is an ejaculation that is painful or uncomfortable. Retrograde ejaculation is the condition where semen travels backwards into the bladder rather than out the urethra.","wikipedia","5.7"
"3.216","Electrical sensitivity","","Electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS) is a claimed sensitivity to electromagnetic fields, to which negative symptoms are attributed. EHS has no scientific basis and is not a recognised medical diagnosis. Claims are characterized by a ""variety of non-specific symptoms, which afflicted individuals attribute to exposure to electromagnetic fields"".Those who are self-described with EHS report adverse reactions to electromagnetic fields at intensities well below the maximum levels permitted by international radiation safety standards.  The majority of provocation trials to date have found that such claimants are unable to distinguish between exposure and non-exposure to electromagnetic fields. A systematic review of medical research in 2011 found no convincing scientific evidence for symptoms being caused by electromagnetic fields. Since then, several double-blind experiments have shown that people who report electromagnetic hypersensitivity are unable to detect the presence of electromagnetic fields and are as likely to report ill health following a sham exposure as they are following exposure to genuine electromagnetic fields, suggesting the cause in these cases to be the nocebo effect.As of 2005 the WHO recommended that people presenting with claims of EHS be evaluated to determine if they have a medical condition that may be causing the symptoms the person is attributing to EHS, that they have a psychological evaluation, and that the person's environment be evaluated for issues like air or noise pollution that may be causing problems. Cognitive behavioral therapy may be helpful in managing the condition.Some people who feel they are sensitive to electromagnetic fields may seek to reduce their exposure or use alternative medicine. Government agencies have enforced false advertising claims against companies selling devices to shield against EM radiation.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.215","Electric car","","An electric car is an automobile that is propelled by one or more electric motors, using energy stored in rechargeable batteries. The first practical electric cars were produced in the 1880s. Electric cars were popular in the late 19th century and early 20th century, until advances in internal combustion engines, electric starters in particular, and mass production of cheaper gasoline vehicles led to a decline in the use of electric drive vehicles.\nFrom 2008, a renaissance in electric vehicle manufacturing occurred due to advances in batteries, and the desire to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve urban air quality. Several national and local governments have established government incentives for plug-in electric vehicles, tax credits, subsidies, and other incentives to promote the introduction and adoption in the mass market of new electric vehicles, often depending on battery size, their electric range and purchase price. The current maximum tax credit allowed by the US Government is US$7,500 per car. Compared with internal combustion engine cars, electric cars are quieter, and have no tailpipe emissions and lower emissions in general. In January 2019 and updated in April, a Reuters analysis of 29 global automakers concluded that automakers are planning on spending $300 billion over the next 5 to 10 years on electric cars, with 45% of that investment projected to occur in China.Charging an electric car can be done at a variety of charging stations, these charging stations can be installed in both houses and public areas. The Tesla Model 3 was the world's best selling EV from 2018 to 2019 and had a maximum electric range of 500 km (310 miles) according to the EPA.As of December 2018, there were about 5.3 million light-duty all-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles in use around the world. Despite the rapid growth experienced, the global stock of plug-in electric cars represented just about 1 out of every 250 vehicles (0.40%) on the world's roads by the end of 2018. The plug-in car market is shifting towards fully electric battery vehicles, as the global ratio between annual sales of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) rose from 56:44 in 2012, to 60:40 in 2015, and 69:31 in 2018.\n\n","wikipedia","5.4"
"3.217","Electronic voting","","Electronic voting (also known as e-voting) is voting that uses electronic means to either aid or take care of casting and counting votes.\nDepending on the particular implementation, e-voting may use standalone electronic voting machines (also called EVM) or computers connected to the Internet.  It may encompass a range of Internet services, from basic transmission of tabulated results to full-function online voting through common connectable household devices. The degree of automation may be limited to marking a paper ballot, or may be a comprehensive system of vote input, vote recording, data encryption and transmission to servers, and consolidation and tabulation of election results.\nA worthy e-voting system must perform most of these tasks while complying with a set of standards established by regulatory bodies, and must also be capable to deal successfully with strong requirements associated with security, accuracy, integrity, swiftness, privacy, auditability, accessibility, cost-effectiveness, scalability and ecological sustainability.\nElectronic voting technology can include punched cards, optical scan voting systems and specialized voting kiosks (including self-contained direct-recording electronic voting systems, or DRE). It can also involve transmission of ballots and votes via telephones, private computer networks, or the Internet.\nIn general, two main types of e-voting can be identified:\n\ne-voting which is physically supervised by representatives of governmental or independent electoral authorities (e.g. electronic voting machines located at polling stations);\nremote e-voting via the Internet (also called i-voting) where the voter submits their votes electronically to the election authorities, from any location.","wikipedia","5.4"
"3.218","Elitism","","Elitism is the belief or attitude that individuals who form an elite\u2014a select group of people with an intrinsic quality, high intellect, wealth, special skills, or experience\u2014are more likely to be constructive to society as a whole, and therefore deserve influence or authority greater than that of others. The term elitism may be used to describe a situation in which power is concentrated in the hands of a limited number of people. Oppositions of elitism include anti-elitism, egalitarianism, populism, and political theory of pluralism.\nElite theory is the sociological or political science analysis of elite influence in society: elite theorists regard pluralism as a utopian ideal.\nElitism is closely related to social class and what sociologists call social stratification, which in the Anglo Saxon tradition have long been anchored in the ""blue blood"" claims of hereditary nobility. Members of the upper classes are sometimes known as the social elite.\nThe term elitism is also sometimes used to denote situations in which a group of people claiming to possess high abilities or simply an in-group or cadre grant themselves extra privileges at the expense of others. This form of elitism may be described as discrimination.Some synonyms for ""elite"" might be ""upper-class"" or ""aristocratic"", indicating that the individual in question has a relatively large degree of control over a society's means of production. This includes those who gain this position due to socioeconomic means and not personal achievement. However, these terms are misleading when discussing elitism as a political theory, because they are often associated with negative ""class"" connotations and fail to appreciate a more unbiased exploration of the philosophy.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.219","Emo","","Emo  is a rock music genre characterized by an emphasis on emotional expression, sometimes through confessional lyrics. It emerged as a style of post-hardcore from the mid-1980s hardcore punk movement in Washington, D.C., where it was known as emotional hardcore or emocore and pioneered by bands such as Rites of Spring and Embrace. In the early\u2013mid 1990s, emo was adopted and reinvented by alternative rock, indie rock and pop punk bands such as Sunny Day Real Estate, Jawbreaker, Weezer and Jimmy Eat World, with Weezer breaking into the mainstream during this time. By the mid-1990s, bands such as Braid, the Promise Ring and the Get Up Kids emerged from the burgeoning Midwest emo scene, and several independent record labels began to specialize in the genre. Meanwhile, screamo, a more aggressive style of emo using screamed vocals, also emerged, pioneered by the San Diego bands Heroin and Antioch Arrow. Screamo achieved mainstream success in the 2000s with bands like Hawthorne Heights, Silverstein, Story of the Year, Thursday, The Used, and Underoath.\nOften seen as a subculture, emo also signifies a specific relationship between fans and artists and certain aspects of fashion, culture and behavior. Emo fashion has been associated with skinny jeans; tight t-shirts with band names; studded belts; and flat, straight, jet-black hair with long bangs. Fans of emo music who dress like this are referred to as ""emo kids"" or ""emos"". Emos are known for listening to emo bands like My Chemical Romance, Fall Out Boy, Hawthorne Heights, The Used, and AFI. The emo subculture is stereotypically associated with emotion, sensitivity, misanthropy, shyness, introversion and angst, as well as depression, self-harm and suicide. Its quick rise in popularity in the early 2000s inspired a backlash, with bands such as My Chemical Romance and Panic! at the Disco rejecting the emo label because of the social stigma and controversy surrounding it.\nEmo entered mainstream culture in the early 2000s with the success of Jimmy Eat World and Dashboard Confessional and many artists signed to major record labels. Bands such as My Chemical Romance, AFI, Fall Out Boy and the Red Jumpsuit Apparatus continued the genre's popularity during the rest of the decade. In the early 2010s, emo's popularity had declined, with some groups changing their sound and others disbanding. Meanwhile, however, a mainly underground emo revival emerged, with bands such as The World Is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die and Modern Baseball drawing on the sound and aesthetic of 1990s emo. During the late 2010s, a fusion genre called emo rap became mainstream, with some of emo rap's most famous artists including XXXTentacion and Lil Peep.","wikipedia","5.13"

"3.221","Entertainment Software Rating Board","","The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) is an American self-regulatory organization that assigns age and content ratings to consumer video games. The ESRB was established in 1994 by the Entertainment Software Association (ESA, formerly the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA)), in response to criticism of controversial video games with excessively violent or sexual content, particularly after the 1993 congressional hearings following the releases of Mortal Kombat and Night Trap for home consoles. The industry, pressured with potential government oversight of video game ratings from these hearings, established both the IDSA and the ESRB within it to create a voluntary ratings system based on the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system with additional considerations for video game interactivity.\nThe board assigns ratings to games based on their content, using judgment similar to the motion picture rating systems used in many countries, using a combination of six age-based levels intended to aid consumers in determining a game's content and suitability, along with a system of ""content descriptors"" which detail specific types of content present in a particular game. More recently, the ratings also include descriptors for games with online interactivity or in-game monetization. The ratings are determined by a combination of material provided by the game's publisher in both questionnaires and video footage of the game, and a review of this material by a panel of reviewers who assign it a rating. The ratings are designed towards parents so they can make informed decisions about purchasing games for their children. Once a game is rated, the ESRB maintains a code of ethics for the advertising and promotion of video games\u2014ensuring that marketing materials for games are targeted to appropriate audiences.\nThe ESRB ratings system is enforced via the voluntary leverage of the North American video game and retail industries for physical releases; most stores require customers to present photo identification when purchasing games carrying the ESRB's highest age ratings, and do not stock games which have not been rated. Additionally, major console manufacturers will not license games for their systems unless they carry ESRB ratings, while console manufacturers and most stores will refuse to stock games that the ESRB has rated as being appropriate for adults only. More recently, the ESRB began offering a system to automatically assign ratings for digitally-distributed games and mobile apps, which utilizes a survey answered by the product's publisher as opposed to a manual assessment by ESRB staff, allowing online storefronts to filter and restrict titles based on the ESRB. Through the International Age Rating Coalition (IARC), this method can generate equivalent ratings for other territories. Alongside its game rating operation, the ESRB also provides certification services for online privacy on websites and mobile apps. There have been attempts to pass federal and state laws to force retailers into compliance with the ESRB, but the 2011 Supreme Court case Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association ruled that video games are protected speech, and such laws are unconstitutional.\nDue to the level of consumer and retail awareness of the ratings system, along with the organization's efforts to ensure that retailers comply with the ratings system and that publishers comply with its marketing code, the ESRB has considered its system to be effective, and was praised by the Federal Trade Commission for being the ""strongest"" self-regulatory organization in the entertainment sector. Despite its positive reception, the ESRB has still faced criticism from politicians and other watchdog groups for the structure of its operations, particularly in the wake of a 2005 incident that surrounded the organization's handling of ""hidden"", objectionable content in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas which could be accessed using a user-created modification.\nThe ESRB has been accused of having a conflict of interest because of its vested interest in the video game industry, and that it does not rate certain games, such as the Grand Theft Auto series, harshly enough for their violent or sexual content in order to protect their commercial viability. Contrarily, other critics have argued that, at the same time, the ESRB rates certain games too strongly for their content, and that its influence has stifled the viability of adult-oriented video games due to the board's restrictions on how they are marketed and sold.","wikipedia","5.12"
"3.222","Environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing","","The environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing is related to land use and water consumption, air emissions, including methane emissions, brine and fracturing fluid leakage, water contamination, noise pollution, and health. Water and air pollution are the biggest risks to human health from hydraulic fracturing. Research has determined that human health is affected. Adherence to regulation and safety procedures is required to avoid further negative impacts.Hydraulic fracturing fluids include proppants and other substances, which may include toxic chemicals. In the United States, such additives may be treated as trade secrets by companies who use them. Lack of knowledge about specific chemicals has complicated efforts to develop risk management policies and to study health effects. In other jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom, these chemicals must be made public and their applications are required to be nonhazardous.Water usage by hydraulic fracturing can be a problem in areas that experience water shortage. Surface water may be contaminated through spillage and improperly built and maintained waste pits, in jurisdictions where these are permitted. Further, ground water can be contaminated if fracturing fluids and formation fluids are able to escape during hydraulic fracturing. However, the possibility of groundwater contamination from the fracturing fluid upward migration is negligible, even in a long-term period. Produced water, the water that returns to the surface after hydraulic fracturing, is managed by underground injection, municipal and commercial wastewater treatment, and reuse in future wells. There is potential for methane to leak into ground water and the air, though escape of methane is a bigger problem in older wells than in those built under more recent legislation.Hydraulic fracturing causes induced seismicity called microseismic events or microearthquakes. The magnitude of these events is too small to be detected at the surface, being of magnitude M-3 to M-1 usually. However, fluid disposal wells (which are often used in the USA to dispose of polluted waste from several industries) have been responsible for earthquakes up to 5.6M in Oklahoma and other states.Governments worldwide are developing regulatory frameworks to assess and manage environmental and associated health risks, working under pressure from industry on the one hand, and from anti-fracking groups on the other.  In some countries like France a precautionary approach has been favored and hydraulic fracturing has been banned. The United Kingdom's regulatory framework is based on the conclusion that the risks associated with hydraulic fracturing are manageable if carried out under effective regulation and if operational best practices are implemented.","wikipedia","5.9"
"3.223","Environmental vegetarianism","","Environmental vegetarianism is the practice of vegetarianism when motivated by the desire to create a sustainable diet that avoids the negative environmental impact of meat production. Livestock as a whole is estimated to be responsible for around 18% of global greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, significant reduction in meat consumption has been advocated by, among others, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  in their 2019 special report and as part of the 2017 World Scientists' Warning to Humanity.Other than climate change, environmental concerns about the production of animal products may also relate to pollution, deforestation, unsustainability and the use of water and land.","wikipedia","5.9"
"3.224","Esports","","Esports (also known as electronic sports, e-sports, or eSports) is a form of sport competition using video games. Esports often takes the form of organized, multiplayer video game competitions, particularly between professional players, individually or as teams. Although organized competitions have long been a part of video game culture, these were largely between amateurs until the late 2000s, when participation by professional gamers and spectatorship in these events through live streaming saw a large surge in popularity. By the 2010s, esports was a significant factor in the video game industry, with many game developers actively designing and providing funding for tournaments and other events.\nThe most common video game genres associated with esports are multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA), first-person shooter (FPS), fighting, card games, battle royales, and real-time strategy (RTS). Popular esport franchises include League of Legends, Dota, Counter-Strike, Overwatch, Super Smash Bros., and StarCraft, among many others. Tournaments such as the League of Legends World Championship,  Dota 2's International, the fighting game-specific Evolution Championship Series (EVO) and Intel Extreme Masters are among the most popular in esports. Many other competitions use a series of league play with sponsored teams, such as the Overwatch League. Although the legitimacy of esports as a true sporting competition remains in question, they have been featured alongside traditional sports in some multinational events in Asia, with the International Olympic Committee also having discussed their inclusion into future Olympic events.\nBy the late 2010s, it was estimated that the total audience of esports would grow to 454 million viewers, with revenue increasing to over US$1 billion. The increasing availability of online streaming media platforms, particularly YouTube and Twitch, have become central to the growth and promotion of esports competitions. Despite viewership being approximately 85% male and 15% female, with a majority of viewers between the ages of 18 and 34, female gamers have also played professionally. The popularity and recognition of esports first took place in Asia, specifically in China and South Korea, with the latter having licensed professional players since 2000. Despite its large video game industry, esports in Japan is relatively underdeveloped, with this being largely attributed to its broad anti-gambling laws which prohibit paid professional gaming tournaments. Outside of Asia, esports are also popular in Europe and the Americas, with both regional and international events taking place in those regions.","wikipedia","5.11"
"3.225","Ethnicity","","An ethnic group or  ethnicity is a category of people who identify with each other, usually on the basis of presumed similarities such as common language, ancestry, history, society, culture, nation or social treatment within their residing area. Ethnicity is often used synonymously with the term nation, particularly in cases of ethnic nationalism, and is separate from but related to the concept of races.\nEthnicity is usually an inherited status based on the society in which one lives. Membership of an ethnic group tends to be defined by a shared cultural heritage, ancestry, origin myth, history, homeland, language or dialect, symbolic systems such as religion, mythology and ritual, cuisine, dressing style, art or physical appearance. Ethnic groups often continue to speak related languages and share a similar gene pool. By way of language shift, acculturation, adoption and religious conversion.\nThe largest ethnic groups in modern times comprise hundreds of millions of individuals (Han Chinese being the largest), while the smallest are limited to a few dozen individuals (numerous indigenous peoples worldwide). Ethnic groups may be subdivided into subgroups or tribes, which over time may become separate ethnic groups themselves due to endogamy or physical isolation from the parent group. Conversely, formerly separate ethnicities can merge to form a pan-ethnicity and may eventually merge into one single ethnicity. Whether through division or amalgamation, the formation of a separate ethnic identity is referred to as ethnogenesis.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.226","Eugenics","","Eugenics (; from Greek \u03b5\u1f50\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03ae\u03c2 eugenes - ""well-born"") is a set of beliefs and practices that aim to improve  the genetic quality of a human population, typically by excluding people and groups judged to be inferior, and promoting those judged to be superior.The concept predates the term; Plato suggested applying the principles of selective breeding to humans around 400 BC. Early advocates of eugenics in the 19th century regarded it as a way of improving groups of people. In modern usage, the term eugenics has close ties to scientific racism and white supremacism. Modern bioethicists who advocate new eugenics characterise it as a way of enhancing individual traits, regardless of group membership.\nWhile eugenic principles have been practiced as early as ancient Greece, the contemporary history of eugenics began in the early 20th century, when a popular eugenics movement emerged in the United Kingdom, and then spread to many countries, including the United States, Canada, and most European countries. In this period, people from across the political spectrum espoused eugenic ideas. Consequently, many countries adopted eugenic policies, intended to improve the quality of their populations' genetic stock. Such programs included both positive measures, such as encouraging individuals deemed particularly ""fit"" to reproduce, and negative measures, such as marriage prohibitions and forced sterilization of people deemed unfit for reproduction. Those deemed ""unfit to reproduce"" often included people with mental or physical disabilities, people who scored in the low ranges on different IQ tests, criminals and ""deviants,"" and members of disfavored minority groups.\nThe eugenics movement became associated with Nazi Germany and the Holocaust when the defense of many of the defendants at the Nuremberg trials of 1945 to 1946 attempted to justify their human-rights abuses by claiming there was little difference between the Nazi eugenics programs and the U.S. eugenics programs. In the decades following World War II, with more emphasis on human rights, many countries began to abandon eugenics policies, although some Western countries (the  United States,  Canada, and Sweden among them) continued to carry out forced sterilizations.\nSince the 1980s and 1990s, with new assisted reproductive technology procedures available, such as gestational surrogacy (available since 1985), preimplantation genetic diagnosis (available since 1989), and cytoplasmic transfer (first performed in 1996), concern has grown about the possible revival of a more potent form of eugenics after decades of promoting human rights.\nA criticism of eugenics policies is that, regardless of whether negative or positive policies are used, they are susceptible to abuse because the genetic selection criteria are determined by whichever group has political power at the time. Furthermore, many criticize negative eugenics in particular as a violation of basic human rights, seen (since 1968's Proclamation of Tehran) as including the  right to reproduce. Another criticism is that eugenics policies eventually lead to a loss of genetic diversity, thereby resulting in inbreeding depression due to a loss of genetic variation. Yet another criticism of contemporary eugenics policies is that they propose to permanently and artificially disrupt millions of years of evolution, and that attempting to create genetic lines ""clean"" of ""disorders"" can have far-reaching ancillary downstream effects in the genetic ecology, including negative effects on  immunity and on species  resilience.","wikipedia","5.8"

"3.227","European Union","","The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of 27 member states that are located primarily in Europe. Its members have a combined area of 4,233,255.3 km2 (1,634,469.0 sq mi) and an estimated total population of about 447 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states in those matters, and only those matters, where members have agreed to act as one. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries and regional development. For travel within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999, coming into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.\nThe EU and European citizenship were established when the Maastricht Treaty came into force in 1993. The EU traces its origins to the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the European Economic Community (EEC), established, respectively, by the 1951 Treaty of Paris and 1957 Treaty of Rome. The original members of what came to be known as the European Communities were the Inner Six: Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany. The Communities and their successors have grown in size by the accession of new member states and in power by the addition of policy areas to their remit. The latest major amendment to the constitutional basis of the EU, the Treaty of Lisbon, came into force in 2009. \nIn January 2020, the United Kingdom became the first member state ever to leave the EU. Following a 2016 referendum, the UK signified its intention to leave and negotiated a withdrawal agreement.  \nThe UK is in a transitional phase until at least 31 December 2020, during which it remains subject to EU law and part of the EU single market and customs union. Before this, only three territories of member states had left the EU or its forerunners, these being French Algeria (in 1962, upon independence), Greenland (in 1985, following a referendum) and Saint Barth\u00e9lemy (in 2012).\nContaining in 2020 some 5.8% of the world population, the EU in 2017 (including the United Kingdom) had generated a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) of around 20 trillion US dollars, constituting approximately 25% of global nominal GDP. Additionally, all EU countries have a very high Human Development Index, according to the United Nations Development Programme. In 2012, the EU was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Through the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the EU has developed a role in external relations and defence. The union maintains permanent diplomatic missions throughout the world and represents itself at the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the G7 and the G20. Due to its global influence, the European Union has been described as an emerging superpower.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.229","Euthanasia","","Euthanasia (from Greek: \u03b5\u1f50\u03b8\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03b1; ""good death"": \u03b5\u1f56, eu; ""well"" or ""good"" + \u03b8\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, thanatos; ""death"") is the practice of intentionally ending a life to relieve pain and suffering.Different countries have different euthanasia laws. The British House of Lords select committee on medical ethics defines euthanasia as ""a deliberate intervention undertaken with the express intention of ending a life, to relieve intractable suffering"". In the Netherlands and Belgium, euthanasia is understood as ""termination of life by a doctor at the request of a patient"". The Dutch law, however, does not use the term 'euthanasia' but includes the concept under the broader definition of ""assisted suicide and termination of life on request"".Euthanasia is categorized in different ways, which include voluntary, non-voluntary, or involuntary:\nVoluntary euthanasia is legal in some countries.\nNon-voluntary euthanasia (patient's consent unavailable) is illegal in all countries.\nInvoluntary euthanasia (without asking consent or against the patient's will) is also illegal in all countries and is usually considered murder.As of 2006 euthanasia had become the most active area of research in bioethics.\nIn some countries divisive public controversy occurs over the moral, ethical, and legal issues associated with euthanasia. Passive euthanasia (known as ""pulling the plug"") is legal under some circumstances in many countries. Active euthanasia, however, is legal or de facto legal in only a handful of countries (for example: Belgium, Canada and Switzerland), which limit it to specific circumstances and require the approval of  counselors and doctors or other specialists. In some countries - such as Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan - support for active euthanasia is almost non-existent.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.230","Evangelicalism","","Evangelicalism (), evangelical Christianity, or evangelical Protestantism, is a worldwide, trans-denominational movement within Protestant Christianity which maintains the belief that the essence of the Gospel consists of the doctrine of salvation by grace alone, solely through faith in Jesus's atonement. Evangelicals believe in the centrality of the conversion or ""born again"" experience in receiving salvation, in the authority of the Bible as God's revelation to humanity, and in spreading the Christian message. The movement has long had a presence in the Anglosphere before spreading further afield in the 19th, 20th and early 21st centuries.\nIts origins are usually traced to 1738, with various theological streams contributing to its foundation, including Pietism, Puritanism, Presbyterianism and the Moravian Church (in particular its bishop Nicolaus Zinzendorf and his community at Herrnhut). Preeminently, John Wesley and other early Methodists were at the root of sparking this new movement during the First Great Awakening. Today, evangelicals are found across many Protestant branches, as well as in various denominations not subsumed to a specific branch. Among leaders and major figures of the evangelical Protestant movement were John Wesley, George Whitefield, Jonathan Edwards, Billy Graham, Bill Bright, Harold Ockenga, John Stott and Martyn Lloyd-Jones. The movement gained great momentum during the 18th and 19th centuries with the Great Awakenings in Great Britain and the United States.\nIn 2016, there were an estimated 619 million evangelicals in the world, meaning that one in four Christians would be classified as evangelical. The United States has the largest concentration of evangelicals in the world. American evangelicals are a quarter of the nation's population and its single largest religious group. Evangelical movements can be found in nearly every Protestant denomination and tradition, particularly within Reformed, Baptist, Wesleyan, Pentecostal, Churches of Christ, Plymouth Brethren, charismatic Protestant, and nondenominational Protestant churches.\n\n","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.231","Evolution","","Evolution is change in the heritable characteristics of biological populations over successive generations. These characteristics are the expressions of genes that are passed on from parent to offspring during reproduction. Different characteristics tend to exist within any given population as a result of mutation, genetic recombination and other sources of genetic variation. Evolution occurs when evolutionary processes such as natural selection (including sexual selection) and genetic drift act on this variation, resulting in certain characteristics becoming more common or rare within a population. It is this process of evolution that has given rise to biodiversity at every level of biological organisation, including the levels of species, individual organisms and molecules.The scientific theory of evolution by natural selection was conceived independently by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in the mid-19th century and was set out in detail in Darwin's book On the Origin of Species (1859). Evolution by natural selection was first demonstrated by the observation that more offspring are often produced than can possibly survive. This is followed by three observable facts about living organisms: (1) traits vary among individuals with respect to their morphology, physiology and behaviour (phenotypic variation), (2) different traits confer different rates of survival and reproduction (differential fitness) and (3) traits can be passed from generation to generation (heritability of fitness). Thus, in successive generations members of a population are more likely to be replaced by the progenies of parents with favourable characteristics that have enabled them to survive and reproduce in their respective environments. In the early 20th century, other competing ideas of evolution such as mutationism and orthogenesis were refuted as the modern synthesis reconciled Darwinian evolution with classical genetics, which established adaptive evolution as being caused by natural selection acting on Mendelian genetic variation.All life on Earth shares a last universal common ancestor (LUCA) that lived approximately 3.5\u20133.8 billion years ago. The fossil record includes a progression from early biogenic graphite, to microbial mat fossils, to fossilised multicellular organisms. Existing patterns of biodiversity have been shaped by repeated formations of new species (speciation), changes within species (anagenesis) and loss of species (extinction) throughout the evolutionary history of life on Earth. Morphological and biochemical traits are more similar among species that share a more recent common ancestor, and can be used to reconstruct phylogenetic trees.Evolutionary biologists have continued to study various aspects of evolution by forming and testing hypotheses as well as constructing theories based on evidence from the field or laboratory and on data generated by the methods of mathematical and theoretical biology. Their discoveries have influenced not just the development of biology but numerous other scientific and industrial fields, including agriculture, medicine and computer science.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.232","Extraterrestrial Life","","Extraterrestrial life is hypothetical life which may occur outside of Earth and which did not originate on Earth. Such life might range from simple prokaryotes (or comparable life forms) to beings with civilizations far more advanced than humanity. The Drake equation speculates about the existence of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe. The science of extraterrestrial life in all its forms is known as astrobiology.\nSince the mid-20th century, active ongoing research has taken place to look for signs of extraterrestrial life. This encompasses a search for current and historic extraterrestrial life, and a narrower search for extraterrestrial intelligent life. Depending on the category of search, methods range from the analysis of telescope and specimen data to radios used to detect and send communication signals.\nThe concept of extraterrestrial life, and particularly extraterrestrial intelligence, has had a major cultural impact, chiefly in works of science fiction. Over the years, science fiction has introduced a number of theoretical ideas, each having a wide range of possibilities. Many have piqued public interest in the possibilities of extraterrestrial life. One particular concern is the wisdom of attempting communication with extraterrestrial intelligence. Some encourage aggressive methods to make contact with intelligent extraterrestrial life. Others argue to do so may give away the location of Earth, making an invasion possible in the future.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.233","Facebook","","Facebook is an American online social media and social networking service based in Menlo Park, California and a flagship service of the namesake company Facebook, Inc. It was founded by Mark Zuckerberg, along with fellow Harvard College students and roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes.\nThe founders initially limited Facebook membership to Harvard students. Membership was expanded to Ivy League universities, MIT, and higher education institutions in the Boston area, then various other universities, and lastly high school students. Since 2006, anyone who claims to be at least 13 years old has been allowed to become a registered user of Facebook, though this may vary depending on local laws. The name comes from the face book directories often given to American university students.\nThe Facebook service can be accessed from devices with Internet connectivity, such as personal computers, tablets and smartphones. After registering, users can create a profile revealing information about themselves. They can post text, photos and multimedia which is shared with any other users that have agreed to be their ""friend"", or, with a different privacy setting, with any reader. Users can also use various embedded apps, join common-interest groups, buy and sell items or services on Marketplace, and receive notifications of their Facebook friends' activities and activities of Facebook pages they follow. Facebook claimed that it had more than 2.3 billion monthly active users as of December 2018.Facebook has been subject to extensive media coverage and many controversies. These often involve user privacy (as with the Cambridge Analytica data scandal), political manipulation (as with the 2016 U.S. elections), psychological effects such as addiction and low self-esteem, and content that some users find objectionable, including fake news, conspiracy theories, and copyright infringement. Commentators have accused Facebook of helping to spread false information and fake news. In 2017, Facebook partnered with fact checkers from the Poynter Institute's International Fact-Checking Network to identify and mark false content, though most ads from political candidates are exempt from this program. Critics of the program accuse Facebook of not doing enough to remove false information from its website. Facebook was the most downloaded mobile app of the 2010s globally.","wikipedia","['5.4','5.13']"
"3.234","Factory farming","","Intensive animal farming or industrial livestock production, also known by its opponents as factory farming, is a type of intensive agriculture, specifically an approach to animal husbandry designed to maximize production, while minimizing costs. To achieve this, agribusinesses keep livestock such as cattle, poultry, and fish at high stocking densities, at large scale, and using modern machinery, biotechnology, and global trade. The main products of this industry are meat, milk and eggs for human consumption. There are issues regarding whether intensive animal farming is sustainable or ethical.There is a continuing debate over the benefits, risks and ethics of intensive animal farming. The issues include the efficiency of food production; animal welfare; health risks and the environmental impact (e.g. agricultural pollution and climate change).","wikipedia","5.4"
"3.235","Falkland Islands","","The Falkland Islands (; Spanish: Islas Malvinas, pronounced [\u02c8islas mal\u02c8\u03b2inas]) is an archipelago in the South Atlantic Ocean on the Patagonian Shelf. The principal islands are about 300 miles (483 kilometres) east of South America's southern Patagonian coast, and about 752 miles (1,210 kilometres) from the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, at a latitude of about 52\u00b0S. The archipelago, with an area of 4,700 square miles (12,000 square kilometres), comprises East Falkland, West Falkland and 776 smaller islands. As a British overseas territory, the Falklands have internal self-governance, and the United Kingdom takes responsibility for their defence and foreign affairs. The Falkland Islands' capital is Stanley on East Falkland.\nControversy exists over the Falklands' discovery and subsequent colonisation by Europeans. At various times, the islands have had French, British, Spanish, and Argentine settlements. Britain reasserted its rule in 1833, but Argentina maintains its claim to the islands. In April 1982, Argentine military forces invaded the islands. British administration was restored two months later at the end of the Falklands War. Almost all Falklanders favour the archipelago remaining a UK overseas territory. Its sovereignty status is part of an ongoing dispute between Argentina and the United Kingdom.\nThe population (3,398 inhabitants in 2016) consists primarily of native-born Falkland Islanders, the majority of British descent. Other ethnicities include French, Gibraltarian and Scandinavian. Immigration from the United Kingdom, the South Atlantic island of Saint Helena, and Chile has reversed a population decline. The predominant (and official) language is English. Under the British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983, Falkland Islanders are British citizens.\nThe islands lie on the boundary of the subantarctic oceanic and tundra climate zones, and both major islands have mountain ranges reaching  2,300 feet (700 m). They are home to large bird populations, although many no longer breed on the main islands because of competition from introduced species. Major economic activities include fishing, tourism and sheep farming, with an emphasis on high-quality wool exports. Oil exploration, licensed by the Falkland Islands Government, remains controversial as a result of maritime disputes with Argentina.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.236","Falun Gong","","Falun Gong (UK:  , US: ) or Falun Dafa (; Standard Mandarin Chinese: [f\u00e0lw\u0259\u030cn t\u00e2f\u00e0]; literally, ""Dharma Wheel Practice"" or ""Law Wheel Practice"") is a Chinese religious practice that combines meditation and qigong exercises with a moral philosophy centered on the tenets of truthfulness, compassion, and forbearance (Chinese: \u771f\u3001\u5584\u3001\u5fcd). The practice emphasizes morality and the cultivation of virtue, and identifies as a qigong practice of the Buddhist school, though its teachings also incorporate elements drawn from Taoist traditions. Through moral rectitude and the practice of meditation, practitioners of Falun Gong aspire to eliminate attachments, and ultimately to achieve spiritual enlightenment.\nFalun Gong originated and was first taught publicly in northeastern China in 1992 by Li Hongzhi. It emerged toward the end of China's ""qigong boom""\u2014a period that saw a proliferation of similar practices of meditation, slow-moving energy exercises and regulated breathing. It differs from other qigong schools in its absence of fees or formal membership, lack of daily rituals of worship, its greater emphasis on morality, and the theological nature of its teachings. Western academics have described Falun Gong as a qigong discipline, a ""spiritual movement"", a ""cultivation system"" in the tradition of Chinese antiquity, or as a form of Chinese religion.\nThe practice initially enjoyed support from Chinese officialdom, but by the mid to late 1990s, the Communist Party and public security organizations increasingly viewed Falun Gong as a potential threat due to its size, independence from the state, and spiritual teachings. By 1999, government estimates placed the number of Falun Gong practitioners at 70 million. During that time, negative coverage of Falun Gong began to appear in the state-run press, and practitioners usually responded by picketing the source involved. Most of the time, the practitioners succeeded, but controversy and tension continued to build. The scale of protests grew until April 1999, when over 10,000 Falun Gong practitioners gathered near the central government compound in Beijing to request legal recognition and freedom from state interference. This demonstration is widely seen as catalyzing the persecution that followed.\nOn 20 July 1999, the Communist Party leadership initiated a nationwide crackdown and multifaceted propaganda campaign intended to eradicate the practice. It blocked Internet access to websites that mention Falun Gong, and in October 1999 it declared Falun Gong a ""heretical organization"" that threatened social stability. Falun Gong practitioners in China are reportedly subject to a wide range of human rights abuses: hundreds of thousands are estimated to have been imprisoned extrajudicially, and practitioners in detention are subject to forced labor, psychiatric abuse, torture, and other coercive methods of thought reform at the hands of Chinese authorities. As of 2009, human rights groups estimated that at least 2,000 Falun Gong practitioners had died as a result of abuse in custody. One observer reported that tens of thousands may have been killed to supply China's organ transplant industry (see Organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners in China). In the years since the persecution began, Falun Gong practitioners have become active in advocating for greater human rights in China.\nFalun Gong founder Li Hongzhi has lived in New York City since 1996, and Falun Gong has a sizable global constituency. Inside China, estimates suggest that tens of millions continued to practice Falun Gong in spite of the persecution. Hundreds of thousands are estimated to practice Falun Gong outside China in over 70 countries worldwide.\n\n","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.237","Family Guy","","Family Guy is an American animated sitcom television series created by Seth MacFarlane for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series centers on the Griffins, a family consisting of parents Peter and Lois; their children, Meg, Chris, and Stewie; and their anthropomorphic pet dog, Brian. The show is set in the fictional city of Quahog, Rhode Island, and exhibits much of its surreal & dark humor in the form of metafictional cutaway gags that often lampoon American culture.\nThe family was conceived by MacFarlane after developing two animated films, The Life of Larry and Larry & Steve. MacFarlane redesigned the films' protagonist, Larry, and his dog, Steve, and renamed them Peter and Brian, respectively. MacFarlane pitched a seven-minute pilot to Fox in 1998, and the show was greenlit and began production. Shortly after the third season of Family Guy had aired in 2002, Fox canceled the series with one episode left unaired. Adult Swim aired that episode in 2003, finishing the series' original run. However, favorable DVD sales and high ratings for syndicated reruns on Adult Swim convinced the network to renew the show in 2004 for a fourth season, which began airing on May 1, 2005.\nSince its debut on January 31, 1999, 342 episodes of Family Guy have been broadcast. Its eighteenth season began on September 29, 2019. The show has been widely acclaimed, prompting Family Guy to be nominated for 12 Primetime Emmy Awards and 11 Annie Awards, and has won three of each. In 2009, it was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series, the first time an animated series was nominated for the award since The Flintstones in 1961. Family Guy has also received criticism, including unfavorable comparisons to The Simpsons.\nMany tie-in media have been released, including Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story, a straight-to-DVD special released in 2005; Family Guy: Live in Vegas, a soundtrack-DVD combo released in 2005, featuring music from the show as well as original music created by MacFarlane and Walter Murphy; a video game and pinball machine, released in 2006 and 2007, respectively; since 2005, six books published by Harper Adult based on the Family Guy universe; and Laugh It Up, Fuzzball: The Family Guy Trilogy (2010), a series of parodies of the original Star Wars trilogy. In 2008, MacFarlane confirmed that the cast was interested in producing a feature film and that he was working on a story for a film adaptation.\nA spin-off series, The Cleveland Show, featuring Cleveland Brown, aired from September 27, 2009, to May 19, 2013. ""The Simpsons Guy"", a crossover episode with The Simpsons, aired on September 28, 2014. Family Guy is a joint production by Fuzzy Door Productions and 20th Century Fox Television and syndicated by 20th Television. In 2013, TV Guide ranked Family Guy the ninth Greatest TV Cartoon of All Time.On February 12, 2019, Fox renewed the series for an eighteenth season, which premiered on September 29, 2019 on Animation Domination.","wikipedia","5.13"
"3.238","Family planning","","Family planning services are defined as ""educational, comprehensive medical or social activities which enable individuals, including minors, to determine freely the number and spacing of their children and to select the means by which this may be achieved"".  Family planning may involve consideration of the number of children a woman wishes to have, including the choice to have no children, as well as the age at which she wishes to have them. These matters are influenced by external factors such as marital situation, career considerations, financial position, and any disabilities that may affect their ability to have children and raise them. If sexually active, family planning may involve the use of contraception and other techniques to control the timing of reproduction.Other aspects of family planning include sex education, prevention and management of sexually transmitted infections, pre-conception counseling and management, and infertility management. Family planning, as defined by the United Nations and the World Health Organization, encompasses services leading up to conception. Abortion is not considered a component of family planning, although access to contraception and family planning reduces the need for abortion.Family planning is sometimes used as a synonym or euphemism for access to and the use of contraception. However, it often involves methods and practices in addition to contraception. Additionally, there are many who might wish to use contraception but are not, necessarily, planning a family (e.g., unmarried adolescents, young married couples delaying childbearing while building a career); family planning has become a catch-all phrase for much of the work undertaken in this realm. Contemporary notions of family planning, however, tend to place a woman and her childbearing decisions at the center of the discussion, as notions of women's empowerment and reproductive autonomy have gained traction in many parts of the world. It is most usually applied to a female-male couple who wish to limit the number of children they have and/or to control the timing of pregnancy (also known as spacing children).\nFamily planning has been shown to reduce teenage birth rates and birth rates for unmarried women.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.239","Fantasy sports","","A fantasy sport (also known less commonly as rotisserie or roto) is a type of game, often played using the Internet, where participants assemble imaginary or virtual teams of real players of a professional sport.  These teams compete based on the statistical performance of those players' in actual games.  This performance is converted into points that are compiled and totaled according to a roster selected by each fantasy team's manager.  These point systems can be simple enough to be manually calculated by a ""league commissioner"" who coordinates and manages the overall league, or points can be compiled and calculated using computers tracking actual results of the professional sport.  In fantasy sports, team owners draft, trade and cut (drop) players, analogously to real sports.","wikipedia","5.11"
"3.240","Fascism","","Fascism () is a form of far-right, authoritarian ultranationalism characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, and strong regimentation of society and of the economy which came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe. The first fascist movements emerged in Italy during World War I, before spreading to other European countries. Opposed to liberalism, Marxism, and anarchism, fascism is placed on the far-right within the traditional left\u2013right spectrum.Fascists saw World War I as a revolution that brought massive changes to the nature of war, society, the state, and technology. The advent of total war and the total mass mobilization of society had broken down the distinction between civilians and combatants. A ""military citizenship"" arose in which all citizens were involved with the military in some manner during the war. The war had resulted in the rise of a powerful state capable of mobilizing millions of people to serve on the front lines and providing economic production and logistics to support them, as well as having unprecedented authority to intervene in the lives of citizens.Fascists believe that liberal democracy is obsolete and regard the complete mobilization of society under a totalitarian one-party state as necessary to prepare a nation for armed conflict and to respond effectively to economic difficulties. Such a state is led by a strong leader\u2014such as a dictator and a martial government composed of the members of the governing fascist party\u2014to forge national unity and maintain a stable and orderly society. Fascism rejects assertions that violence is automatically negative in nature and views political violence, war and imperialism as means that can achieve national rejuvenation. Fascists advocate a mixed economy, with the principal goal of achieving autarky (national economic self-sufficiency) through protectionist and interventionist economic policies.Since the end of World War II in 1945, few parties have openly described themselves as fascist, and the term is instead now usually used pejoratively by political opponents. The descriptions neo-fascist or post-fascist are sometimes applied more formally to describe parties of the far-right with ideologies similar to, or rooted in, 20th-century fascist movements.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.241","Federal Communications Commission","","The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent agency of the United States government that regulates communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable across the United States. The FCC maintains jurisdiction over the areas of broadband access, fair competition, radio frequency use, media responsibility, public safety, and homeland security.The FCC was formed by the Communications Act of 1934 to replace the radio regulation functions of the Federal Radio Commission. The FCC took over wire communication regulation from the Interstate Commerce Commission. The FCC's mandated jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the territories of the United States. The FCC also provides varied degrees of cooperation, oversight, and leadership for similar communications bodies in other countries of North America. The FCC is funded entirely by regulatory fees. It has an estimated fiscal-2016 budget of US $388 million.  It has 1,688 federal employees, made up of 50% males and 50% females as of December, 2017.","wikipedia","5.13"
"3.242","Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation","","The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is one of two agencies that provide  deposit insurance to depositors in U.S. depository institutions, the other being the National Credit Union Administration, which regulates and insures credit unions. The FDIC is a United States government corporation providing deposit insurance to depositors in U.S. commercial banks and savings banks. The FDIC was created by the 1933 Banking Act, enacted during the Great Depression to restore trust in the American banking system. More than one-third of banks failed in the years before the FDIC's creation, and bank runs were common. The insurance limit was initially US$2,500 per ownership category, and this was increased several times over the years. Since the passage of the Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2011, the FDIC insures deposits in member banks up to US$250,000 per ownership category.The FDIC and its reserves are not funded by public funds; member banks' insurance dues are the FDIC's primary source of funding. The FDIC also has a US$100 billion line of credit with the United States Department of the Treasury.As of September 2019, the FDIC provided deposit insurance at 5,256 institutions. The FDIC also examines and supervises certain financial institutions for safety and soundness, performs certain consumer-protection functions, and manages receiverships of failed banks.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.243","Federal Marriage Amendment","","The Federal Marriage Amendment (FMA) (also referred to by proponents as the Marriage Protection Amendment) was a proposed amendment to the United States Constitution that would define marriage in the United States as a union of one man and one woman. The FMA would also prevent judicial extension of marriage rights to same-sex or other unmarried heterosexual couples. An amendment to the U.S. Constitution requires the support of two thirds of each house of Congress and ratification by three fourths of the states. The last Congressional vote on the proposed amendment occurred in the House of Representatives on July 18, 2006, when the motion failed 236 to 187, falling short of the 290 votes required for passage in that body. The Senate has only voted on cloture motions with regard to the proposed amendment, the last of which was on June 7, 2006, when the motion failed 49 to 48, falling short of the 60 votes required to allow the Senate to proceed to consideration of the proposal and the 67 votes required to send the proposed amendment to the states for ratification.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.244","Female genital mutilation","","Female genital mutilation (FGM), also known as female genital cutting and female circumcision, is the ritual cutting or removal of some or all of the external female genitalia. The practice is found in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, and within communities from countries in which FGM is common. UNICEF estimated in 2016 that 200 million women living today in 30 countries\u201427 African countries, Indonesia, Iraqi Kurdistan and Yemen\u2014have undergone the procedures.Typically carried out by a traditional circumciser using a blade, FGM is conducted from days after birth to puberty and beyond. In half of the countries for which national figures are available, most girls are cut before the age of five. Procedures differ according to the country or ethnic group. They include removal of the clitoral hood and clitoral glans; removal of the inner labia; and removal of the inner and outer labia and closure of the vulva. In this last procedure, known as infibulation, a small hole is left for the passage of urine and menstrual fluid; the vagina is opened for intercourse and opened further for childbirth.The practice is rooted in gender inequality, attempts to control women's sexuality, and ideas about purity, modesty and beauty. It is usually initiated and carried out by women, who see it as a source of honour and fear that failing to have their daughters and granddaughters cut will expose the girls to social exclusion. Adverse health effects depend on the type of procedure; they can include recurrent infections, difficulty urinating and passing menstrual flow, chronic pain, the development of cysts, an inability to get pregnant, complications during childbirth, and fatal bleeding. There are no known health benefits.There have been international efforts since the 1970s to persuade practitioners to abandon FGM, and it has been outlawed or restricted in most of the countries in which it occurs, although the laws are poorly enforced. Since 2010, the United Nations has called upon healthcare providers to stop performing all forms of the procedure, including reinfibulation after childbirth and symbolic ""nicking"" of the clitoral hood. The opposition to the practice is not without its critics, particularly among anthropologists, who have raised difficult questions about cultural relativism and the universality of human rights.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.245","Feminism","","Feminism is a range of social movements, political movements, and ideologies that aim to define, establish, and achieve the political, economic, personal, and social equality of the sexes. Feminism incorporates the position that societies prioritize the male point of view, and that women are treated unfairly within those societies. Efforts to change that include fighting gender stereotypes and seeking to establish educational and professional opportunities for women that are equal to those for men.\nFeminist movements have campaigned and continue to campaign for women's rights, including the right to vote, to hold public office, to work, to earn fair wages, equal pay and eliminate the gender pay gap, to own property, to receive education, to enter contracts, to have equal rights within marriage, and to have maternity leave. Feminists have also worked to ensure access to legal abortions and social integration and to protect women and girls from rape, sexual harassment, and domestic violence. Changes in dress and acceptable physical activity have often been part of feminist movements.Some scholars consider feminist campaigns to be a main force behind major historical societal changes for women's rights, particularly in the West, where they are near-universally credited with achieving women's suffrage, gender-neutral language, reproductive rights for women (including access to contraceptives and abortion), and the right to enter into contracts and own property. Although feminist advocacy is, and has been, mainly focused on women's rights, some feminists, including bell hooks, argue for the inclusion of men's liberation within its aims, because they believe that men are also harmed by traditional gender roles.Feminist theory, which emerged from feminist movements, aims to understand the nature of gender inequality by examining women's social roles and lived experience; it has developed theories in a variety of disciplines in order to respond to issues concerning gender.Numerous feminist movements and ideologies have developed over the years and represent different viewpoints and aims. Some forms of feminism have been criticized for taking into account only white, middle class, and college-educated perspectives. This criticism led to the creation of ethnically specific or multicultural forms of feminism, including black feminism and intersectional feminism.","wikipedia","['5.5','5.1']"
"3.246","Fetishism","","A fetish (derived from the French f\u00e9tiche; which comes from the Portuguese feiti\u00e7o; and this in turn from Latin facticius, ""artificial"" and facere, ""to make"") is an object believed to have supernatural powers, or in particular, a human-made object that has power over others. Essentially, fetishism is the emic attribution of inherent value or powers to an object.","wikipedia","5.7"
"3.247","File sharing","","File sharing is the practice of distributing or providing access to digital media, such as computer programs, multimedia (audio, images and video), documents or electronic books. File sharing may be achieved in a number of ways. Common methods of storage, transmission and dispersion include manual sharing utilizing removable media, centralized servers on computer networks, World Wide Web-based hyperlinked documents, and the use of distributed peer-to-peer networking.","wikipedia","5.4"
"3.248","Filipino language","","Filipino (English:   (listen); Wikang Filipino [w\u026a\u02c8k\u0250\u014b \u02ccfi\u02d0li\u02c8pi\u02d0no]) is the national language (Wikang pambansa / Pambansang wika) of the Philippines. Filipino is also designated, along with English, as an official language of the country. It is a standardized variety of the Tagalog language, an Austronesian regional language that is widely spoken in the Philippines. As of 2007, Tagalog is the first language of 28 million people, or about one-third of the Philippine population, while 45 million speak Tagalog as their second language. Tagalog is among the 185 languages of the Philippines identified in the Ethnologue. Officially, Filipino is defined by the Commission on the Filipino Language (Komisyon sa Wikang Filipino in Filipino or simply KWF) as ""the native dialect, spoken and written, in Metro Manila, the National Capital Region, and in other urban centers of the archipelago.""Filipino is officially taken to be a pluricentric language, as it is further enriched and developed by the other existing Philippine languages according to the mandate of the 1987 Constitution. Indeed, there have been observed ""emerging varieties of Filipino which deviate from the grammatical properties of Tagalog"" in Cebu, Davao City, and Iloilo which together with Metro Manila form the four largest metropolitan areas in the Philippines.","wikipedia","5.10"
"3.249","Fingering (sexual act)","","Fingering is typically the use of fingers or hands to sexually stimulate the vulva (including the clitoris) or vagina. Vaginal fingering is legally and medically called digital penetration or digital penetration of the vagina. Fingering may also include the use of fingers to sexually stimulate the anus.Fingering may be performed on oneself (masturbation) or by or with a sexual partner. When performed on the vulva or vagina by a sexual partner, it is a form of mutual masturbation, and is analogous to a handjob (the manual stimulation of the penis). It may be used for sexual arousal or foreplay, constitute an entire sexual encounter, or be used as a form of non-penetrative sexual activity. Fingering may be used in association with other sex acts or acts of intimacy, or to enable the woman to achieve orgasm.\n\n","wikipedia","5.7"
"3.250","Flat Earth Society","","Modern flat Earth societies are organizations that promote the belief that the Earth is flat while disputing the Earth's sphericity. Such groups date from the middle of the 20th century; some adherents are serious and some are not. Those who are serious are often motivated by religion, pseudoscience or conspiracy theories.Through the use of social media, flat Earth theories have been increasingly espoused by individuals unaffiliated with larger groups.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.251","Ford Pinto","","The Ford Pinto is a subcompact car that was manufactured and marketed by Ford Motor Company in North America, sold from the 1971 to the 1980 model years.  The smallest American Ford vehicle since 1907, the Pinto was the first subcompact vehicle produced by Ford in North America.\nThe Pinto was marketed in three body styles through its production: a two-door fastback sedan with a trunk, a three-door hatchback, and a two-door station wagon.  Mercury offered rebadged versions of the Pinto as the Mercury Bobcat from 1975 to 1980 (1974\u20131980 in Canada). From 1974 to 1978, the Ford Mustang II shared a common platform with the Pinto and Bobcat, though with a different unibody and powertrain assortment.  For the 1981 model year, the Pinto was replaced by the Ford Escort, as Ford transitioned its product line towards front-wheel drive. Over 3 million Pintos were produced over its 10-year production run, outproducing the combined totals of its domestic rivals, the Chevy Vega and the AMC Gremlin. The Pinto and Mercury Bobcat were produced at Edison Assembly (Edison, New Jersey), St. Thomas Assembly (Southwold, Ontario), and San Jose Assembly (Milpitas, California).Since the 1970s, the safety reputation of the Pinto has been surrounded by controversy.  Its fuel-tank design attracted both media and government scrutiny after several deadly fires related to the tanks rupturing during rear-end collisions. A subsequent analysis of the overall safety of the Pinto suggested it was comparable to other 1970s subcompact cars.  The safety issues surrounding the Pinto and the subsequent response by Ford have been cited widely as a business ethics as well as tort reform case study.","wikipedia","5.4"
"3.252","Fornication","","Fornication is generally consensual sexual intercourse between two people not married to each other. When one of the partners having consensual sexual intercourse is a married person, it is described as adultery.\nFor many people, the term carries an overtone of moral or religious disapproval, but the significance of sexual acts to which the term is applied varies between religions, societies and cultures. In modern usage, the term is often replaced with a more judgment-neutral terms like premarital sex or extramarital sex.","wikipedia","5.7"
"3.253","Fossil fuel","","A fossil fuel is a fuel formed by natural processes, such as anaerobic decomposition of buried dead organisms, containing energy originating in ancient photosynthesis.\nSuch organisms and their resulting fossil fuels typically have an age of millions of years, and sometimes more than 650 million years.\nFossil fuels contain high percentages of carbon and include petroleum, coal, and natural gas.\nCommonly used derivatives of fossil fuels include kerosene and propane.\nFossil fuels range from volatile materials with low carbon-to-hydrogen ratios (like methane), to liquids (like petroleum), to nonvolatile materials composed of almost pure carbon, like anthracite coal.\nMethane can be found in hydrocarbon fields either alone, associated with oil, or in the form of methane clathrates.\nAs of 2018, the world's primary energy sources consisted of petroleum (34%), coal (27%), natural gas (24%), amounting to an 85% share for fossil fuels in primary energy-consumption in the world.\nNon-fossil sources included nuclear (4.4%), hydroelectric (6.8%), and other renewables (4.0%, including geothermal, solar, tidal, wind, wood, waste).\nAccording to another source, world renewable energy-consumption was 18% in 2018. When compared with the previous year, world energy-consumption grew at a rate of 2.9%, almost double its 10-year average of 1.5% per year, and the fastest since 2010.Although natural processes continually form fossil fuels, such fuels are generally classified as non-renewable resources because they take millions of years to form and the known viable reserves are being depleted much faster than new ones are being made.Most air pollution deaths are due to fossil fuels, and fossil fuel phase-out would save 3.6 million lives each year.The use of fossil fuels raises serious environmental concerns.\nThe burning of fossil fuels produces around 21.3 billion tonnes (21.3 gigatonnes) of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year.\nIt is estimated that natural processes can only absorb about half of that amount, so there is a net increase of 10.65 billion tonnes of atmospheric carbon dioxide per year.\nCarbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that increases radiative forcing and contributes to global warming along with ocean acidification.\nA global movement towards the generation of low-carbon renewable energy is underway to help reduce global greenhouse-gas emissions.","wikipedia","5.9"
"3.254","Fox News","","Fox News (officially Fox News Channel and abbreviated FNC) is an American conservative cable television news channel. It is owned by the Fox News Group, which itself was owned by News Corporation from 1996\u20132013, 21st Century Fox from 2013\u20132019, and Fox Corporation since 2019. The channel broadcasts primarily from studios at 1211 Avenue of the Americas in New York City. Fox News is provided in 86 countries or overseas territories worldwide, with international broadcasts featuring Fox Extra segments during ad breaks.\nThe channel was created by Australian-American media mogul Rupert Murdoch to appeal to a conservative audience, hiring former Republican Party media consultant and CNBC executive Roger Ailes as its founding CEO. It launched on October 7, 1996, to 17 million cable subscribers. Fox News grew during the late 1990s and 2000s to become the dominant subscription news network in the U.S. As of September 2018, approximately 87,118,000 US households (90.8% of television subscribers) receive Fox News. In 2019, Fox News was the top-rated cable network averaging 2.5 million viewers. Murdoch is the current executive chairman and Suzanne Scott is the CEO.Fox News has been described as practicing biased reporting in favor of the Republican Party, the George W. Bush and Donald Trump administrations, and conservative causes while slandering the Democratic Party and spreading harmful propaganda intended to negatively affect its members' electoral performances. Critics have cited the channel as detrimental to the integrity of news overall. Fox News employees have said that news reporting operates independently of its opinion and commentary programming, and have denied bias in news reporting, while former employees have said that Fox ordered them to ""slant the news in favor of conservatives"". During Trump's presidency, observers have noted a pronounced tendency of Fox News to serve as a ""mouthpiece"" for the administration, providing ""propaganda"" and a ""feedback loop"" for Trump, with one presidential scholar stating, ""it\u2019s the closest we\u2019ve come to having state TV.""","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.255","Fractional reserve banking","","Fractional-reserve banking is the most common form of banking practised by commercial banks worldwide. It involves banks accepting deposits from customers and making loans to borrowers, while holding in reserve an amount equal to only a fraction of the bank's deposit liabilities. Bank reserves are held as cash in the bank or as balances in the bank's account at the central bank. The minimum amount that banks are required to hold in liquid assets is determined by the country's central bank, and is called the reserve requirement or reserve ratio. Banks usually hold more than this minimum amount, keeping excess reserves. \nBank deposits are usually of a relatively short-term duration while loans made by banks tend to be longer-term \u2013 this requires banks to hold reserves to provide liquidity when deposits are withdrawn. Banks, working on the expectation that only a proportion of depositors will seek to withdraw funds at the same time, keep only a fraction of their liabilities as reserves. Thus, they can experience an unexpected bank run, when depositors wish to withdraw more funds than the reserves held by the bank. In that event, the bank experiencing the liquidity shortfall may borrow from other banks in the interbank lending market; or if there is a general lack of liquidity among the banks, the country's central bank may act as lender of last resort to provide banks with funds to cover this short-term shortfall.Because banks hold reserves in amounts that are less than the amounts of their deposit liabilities, and because the deposit liabilities are considered money in their own right, fractional-reserve banking permits the money supply to grow beyond the amount of the underlying base money originally created by the central bank. In most countries, the central bank (or other monetary policy authority) regulates bank credit creation, imposing reserve requirements and capital adequacy ratios. This helps ensure that banks are solvent and have enough funds to meet demand for withdrawals, and can be used to limit the process of money creation in the banking system. However, rather than directly controlling the money supply, central banks usually pursue an interest rate target to control bank issuance of credit and the rate of inflation.\n\n","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.257","Freedom fighter","","A resistance movement is an organized effort by some portion of the civil population of a country to withstand the legally established government or an occupying power and to disrupt civil order and stability. It may seek to achieve its objectives through either the use of nonviolent resistance (sometimes called civil resistance), or the use of force, whether armed or unarmed. In many cases, as for example in Norway in the Second World War, a resistance movement may employ both violent and non-violent methods, usually operating under different organizations and acting in different phases or geographical areas within a country.On the lawfulness of armed resistance movements in international law, there has been a dispute between states since at least 1899, when the first major codification of the laws of war in the form of a series of international treaties took place. In the Preamble to the 1899 Hague Convention II on Land War, the Martens Clause was introduced as a compromise wording for the dispute between the Great Powers who considered francs-tireurs to be unlawful combatants subject to execution on capture and smaller states who maintained that they should be considered lawful combatants.More recently the 1977 Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, referred in Article 1. Paragraph 4 to armed conflicts ""... in which peoples are fighting against colonial domination and alien occupation and against racist regimes..."" This phraseology contains many ambiguities that cloud the issue of who is or is not a legitimate combatant.Hence depending on the perspective of a state's government, a resistance movement may or may not be labelled a terrorist group based on whether the members of a resistance movement are considered lawful or unlawful combatants and whether they are recognized as having a right to resist occupation. Ultimately, the distinction is a political judgment.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.256","Free trade","","Free trade is a trade policy that does not restrict imports or exports. It can also be understood as the free market idea applied to international trade. In government, free trade is predominantly advocated by political parties that hold liberal economic positions while economically left-wing and nationalist political parties generally support protectionism, the opposite of free trade.\nMost nations are today members of the World Trade Organization multilateral trade agreements. Free trade was best exemplified by the unilateral stance of Great Britain who reduced regulations and duties on imports and exports from the mid nineteenth century to the 1920s. An alternative approach, of creating free trade areas between groups of countries by agreement, such as that of the European Economic Area and the Mercosur open markets, creates a protectionist barrier between that free trade area and the rest of the world. Most governments still impose some protectionist policies that are intended to support local employment, such as applying tariffs to imports or subsidies to exports. Governments may also restrict free trade to limit exports of natural resources. Other barriers that may hinder trade include import quotas, taxes and non-tariff barriers, such as regulatory legislation.\nHistorically, openness to free trade substantially increased from 1815 to the outbreak of World War I. Trade openness increased again during the 1920s, but collapsed (in particular in Europe and North America) during the Great Depression. Trade openness increased substantially again from the 1950s onwards (albeit with a slowdown during the oil crisis of the 1970s). Economists and economic historians contend that current levels of trade openness are the highest they have ever been.There is a broad consensus among economists that protectionism has a negative effect on economic growth and economic welfare while free trade and the reduction of trade barriers has a positive effect on economic growth and economic stability. However, liberalization of trade can cause significant and unequally distributed losses, and the economic dislocation of workers in import-competing sectors.\n\n","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.259","French language in Canada","","French is the mother tongue of about 7.2 million Canadians (20.6 per cent of the Canadian population, second to English at 56 per cent) according to Census Canada 2016. Most native speakers of the French language in Canada live in Quebec, where French is the official and majority language. 77 per cent of Quebec's population are native francophones, and 95 per cent of the population speak French as their first or second language. Additionally, about one million native francophones live in other provinces, forming a sizable minority in New Brunswick, which is officially a bilingual province, where about one-third of the population are francophone. There are also French-speaking communities in Manitoba and Ontario, where francophones make up about 4 per cent of the population, as well as significantly smaller communities in Alberta, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Saskatchewan \u2013 around 1\u20132 per cent. Many of these communities are in the contemporary era supported by French-language institutions.\nBy the Official Languages Act in 1969, Canada recognized English and French as having equal status in the government of Canada. While French, with no specification as to dialect or variety, has the status of one of Canada's two official languages at the federal government level, English is the native language of the majority of Canadians. The federal government provides services and operates in both languages. French is the sole official language in Quebec at the provincial level and is co-official with English in New Brunswick. The provincial governments of Ontario, New Brunswick and Manitoba are required to provide services in French where justified by the number of francophones (those whose mother tongue is French or who use French on a daily basis). French is also an official language of all three territories. However, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms requires all provinces and territories to provide primary and secondary education to their official-language minorities.","wikipedia","5.10"
"3.258","French Revolution","","The French Revolution (French: R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise [\u0281ev\u0254lysj\u0254\u0303 f\u0281\u0251\u0303s\u025b\u02d0z]) was a period of far-reaching social and political upheaval in France and its colonies beginning in 1789. The Revolution overthrew the monarchy, established a republic, catalyzed violent periods of political turmoil, and finally culminated in a dictatorship under Napoleon who brought many of its principles to areas he conquered in Western Europe and beyond. Inspired by liberal and radical ideas, the Revolution made a profound impression on the course of modern history, triggering the global decline of absolute monarchies while replacing them with republics and liberal democracies. Through the Revolutionary Wars, it unleashed a wave of global conflicts that extended from the Caribbean to the Middle East. Historians widely regard the Revolution as one of the most important events in human history.The causes of the French Revolution are complex and are still debated among historians. Following the Seven Years' War and the American Revolutionary War, the French government was deeply in debt. It attempted to restore its financial status through unpopular taxation schemes, which were heavily regressive. Leading up to the Revolution, years of bad harvests worsened by deregulation of the grain industry and environmental problems also inflamed popular resentment of the privileges enjoyed by the aristocracy and the Catholic clergy of the established church. Some historians hold something similar to what Thomas Jefferson proclaimed: that France had ""been awakened by our [American] Revolution."" Demands for change were formulated in terms of Enlightenment ideals and contributed to the convocation of the Estates General in May 1789. During the first year of the Revolution, members of the Third Estate (commoners) took control, the Bastille was attacked in July, the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen was passed in August, and the Women's March on Versailles forced the royal court back to Paris in October. A central event of the first stage, in August 1789, was the abolition of feudalism and the old rules and privileges left over from the Ancien R\u00e9gime.\nThe next few years featured political struggles between various liberal assemblies and right-wing supporters of the monarchy intent on thwarting major reforms. The Republic was proclaimed in September 1792 after the French victory at Valmy. In a momentous event that led to international condemnation, Louis XVI was executed in January 1793.\nExternal threats closely shaped the course of the Revolution. The Revolutionary Wars beginning in 1792 ultimately featured French victories that facilitated the conquest of the Italian Peninsula, the Low Countries and most territories west of the Rhine \u2013 achievements that had eluded previous French governments for centuries. Internally, popular agitation radicalised the Revolution significantly, culminating in the rise of Maximilien Robespierre and the Jacobins. The dictatorship imposed by the Committee of Public Safety during the Reign of Terror, from 1793 until 1794, established price controls on food and other items, abolished slavery in French colonies abroad, de-established the Catholic church (dechristianised society) and created a secular Republican calendar, religious leaders were expelled, and the borders of the new republic were secured from its enemies.\nAfter the Thermidorian Reaction, an executive council known as the Directory assumed control of the French state in 1795. They suspended elections, repudiated debts (creating financial instability in the process), persecuted the Catholic clergy, and made significant military conquests abroad. Dogged by charges of corruption, the Directory collapsed in a coup led by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1799. Napoleon, who became the hero of the Revolution through his popular military campaigns, established the Consulate and later the First Empire, setting the stage for a wider array of global conflicts in the Napoleonic Wars.\nThe modern era has unfolded in the shadow of the French Revolution. Almost all future revolutionary movements looked back to the Revolution as their predecessor. Its central phrases and cultural symbols, such as La Marseillaise and Libert\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, ou la mort, became the clarion call for other major upheavals in modern history, including the Russian Revolution over a century later.The values and institutions of the Revolution dominate French politics to this day. The Revolution resulted in the suppression of the feudal system, emancipation of the individual, a greater division of landed property, abolition of the privileges of noble birth, and nominal establishment of equality among men. The French Revolution differed from other revolutions in being not only national, for it intended to benefit all humanity.Globally, the Revolution accelerated the rise of republics and democracies. It became the focal point for the development of most modern political ideologies, leading to the spread of liberalism, radicalism, nationalism, and secularism, among many others. The Revolution also witnessed the birth of total war by organising the resources of France and the lives of its citizens towards the objective of national defense. Some of its central documents, such as the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, continued to inspire movements for abolitionism and universal suffrage in the next century.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.260","Friedrich Nietzsche","","Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche (, German: [\u02c8f\u0281i\u02d0d\u0281\u026a\u00e7 \u02c8v\u026alh\u025blm \u02c8ni\u02d0t\u0283\u0259] (listen) or [- \u02c8ni\u02d0ts\u0283\u0259]; 15 October 1844 \u2013 25 August 1900) was a German philosopher, cultural critic, composer, poet, philologist, and scholar of Latin and Greek whose work has exerted a profound influence on modern intellectual history. He began his career as a classical philologist before turning to philosophy. He became the youngest ever to hold the Chair of Classical Philology at the University of Basel in 1869 at the age of 24. Nietzsche resigned in 1879 due to health problems that plagued him most of his life; he completed much of his core writing in the following decade. In 1889, at age 44, he suffered a collapse and afterward a complete loss of his mental faculties. He lived his remaining years in the care of his mother until her death in 1897 and then with his sister Elisabeth F\u00f6rster-Nietzsche. Nietzsche died in 1900.Nietzsche's writing spans philosophical polemics, poetry, cultural criticism, and fiction while displaying a fondness for aphorism and irony. Prominent elements of his philosophy include his radical critique of truth in favor of perspectivism; his genealogical critique of religion and Christian morality and his related theory of master\u2013slave morality; his aesthetic affirmation of existence in response to the ""death of God"" and the profound crisis of nihilism; his notion of the Apollonian and Dionysian; and his characterization of the human subject as the expression of competing wills, collectively understood as the will to power. He also developed influential concepts such as the \u00dcbermensch and the doctrine of eternal return. In his later work, he became increasingly preoccupied with the creative powers of the individual to overcome social, cultural and moral contexts in pursuit of new values and aesthetic health. His body of work touched a wide range of topics, including art, philology, history, religion, tragedy, culture, and science, and drew early inspiration from figures such as philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, composer Richard Wagner, and writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.After his death, his sister Elisabeth became the curator and editor of Nietzsche's manuscripts, reworking his unpublished writings to fit her own German nationalist ideology while often contradicting or obfuscating Nietzsche's stated opinions, which were explicitly opposed to antisemitism and nationalism. Through her published editions, Nietzsche's work became associated with fascism and Nazism; 20th century scholars contested this interpretation of his work and corrected editions of his writings were soon made available. Nietzsche's thought enjoyed renewed popularity in the 1960s and his ideas have since had a profound impact on 20th and early-21st century thinkers across philosophy\u2014especially in schools of continental philosophy such as existentialism, postmodernism and post-structuralism\u2014as well as art, literature, psychology, politics and popular culture.","wikipedia","5.2"
"3.261","Fukushima-Daiichi","","The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (\u798f\u5cf6\u7b2c\u4e00\u539f\u5b50\u529b\u767a\u96fb\u6240, Fukushima Daiichi Genshiryoku Hatsudensho) is a disabled nuclear power plant located on a 3.5-square-kilometre (860-acre) site in the towns of \u014ckuma and Futaba in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan. The plant suffered major damage from the magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan on March 11, 2011. The chain of events caused radiation leaks and permanently damaged several reactors, making them impossible to restart. By political decision, the remaining reactors were not restarted.\nFirst commissioned in 1971, the plant consists of six boiling water reactors. These light water reactors drove electrical generators with a combined power of 4.7 GWe, making Fukushima Daiichi one of the 15 largest nuclear power stations in the world. Fukushima was the first nuclear plant to be designed, constructed, and run in conjunction with General Electric and Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO).The March 2011 disaster disabled the reactor cooling systems, leading to releases of radioactivity and triggering a 30 km (19 mi) evacuation zone surrounding the plant; the releases continue to this day. On April 20, 2011, the Japanese authorities declared the 20 km (12 mi) evacuation zone a no-go area which may only be entered under government supervision.\nIn November 2011, the first journalists were allowed to visit the plant. They described a scene of devastation in which three of the reactor buildings were destroyed; the grounds were covered with mangled trucks, crumpled water tanks and other debris left by the tsunami; and radioactive levels were so high that visitors were only allowed to stay for a few hours.In April 2012, Units 1-4 were shut down. Units 2-4 were shut down on April 19, while Unit 1 was the last of these four units to be shut down on April 20 at midnight. In December 2013 TEPCO decided none of the undamaged units will reopen.\nThe sister nuclear plant Fukushima Daini (""number two""), 12 km (7.5 mi) to the south, is also run by TEPCO. It also suffered serious damages during the tsunami, especially at the seawater intakes of all four units, but was successfully shut down and brought to a safe state through extraordinary actions by the plant crew.","wikipedia","5.9"
"3.262","Fundamentalism","","Fundamentalism usually has a religious connotation that indicates unwavering attachment to a set of irreducible beliefs. However, fundamentalism has come to be applied to a tendency among certain groups\u2013mainly, although not exclusively, in religion\u2013that is characterized by a markedly strict  literalism as it is applied to certain specific scriptures, dogmas, or ideologies, and a strong sense of the importance of maintaining ingroup and outgroup distinctions, leading to an emphasis on purity and the desire to return to a previous ideal from which advocates believe members have strayed. Rejection of diversity of opinion as applied to these established ""fundamentals"" and their accepted interpretation within the group often results from this tendency.Depending upon the context, the label ""fundamentalism"" can be a pejorative rather than a neutral characterization, similar to the ways that calling political perspectives ""right-wing"" or ""left-wing"" can have for some negative connotations.","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.265","Gambling","","Gambling (also known as betting) is the wagering of money or something of value (referred to as ""the stakes"") on an event with an uncertain outcome, with the primary intent of winning money or material goods. Gambling thus requires three elements to be present:  consideration (an amount wagered), risk (chance), and a prize. The outcome of the wager is often immediate, such as a single roll of dice, a spin of a roulette wheel, or a horse crossing the finish line, but longer time frames are also common, allowing wagers on the outcome of a future sports contest or even an entire sports season.\nThe term ""gaming"" in this context typically refers to instances in which the activity has been specifically permitted by law. The two words are not mutually exclusive; i.e., a ""gaming"" company offers (legal) ""gambling"" activities to the public and may be regulated by one of many gaming control boards, for example, the Nevada Gaming Control Board. However, this distinction is not universally observed in the English-speaking world. For instance, in the United Kingdom, the regulator of gambling activities is called the Gambling Commission (not the Gaming Commission). The word gaming is used more frequently since the rise of computer and video games to describe activities that do not necessarily involve wagering, especially online gaming, with the new usage still not having displaced the old usage as the primary definition in common dictionaries.  ""Gaming"" has also been used to circumvent laws against ""gambling"". The media and others have used one term or the other to frame conversations around the subjects, resulting in a shift of perceptions among their audiences. Gambling is also a major international commercial activity, with the legal gambling market totaling an estimated $335 billion in 2009.  In other forms, gambling can be conducted with materials which have a value, but are not real money. For example, players of marbles games might wager marbles, and likewise games of Pogs or Magic: The Gathering can be played with the collectible game pieces (respectively, small discs and trading cards) as stakes, resulting in a meta-game regarding the value of a player's collection of pieces.","wikipedia","5.12"
"3.266","Game of Thrones","","Game of Thrones is an American  fantasy drama television series created by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss for HBO. It is an adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire, George R. R. Martin's series of fantasy novels, the first of which is A Game of Thrones. The show was both produced and filmed in Belfast and elsewhere in the United Kingdom. Filming locations also included Canada, Croatia, Iceland, Malta, Morocco, and Spain. The series premiered on HBO in the United States on April 17, 2011, and concluded on May 19, 2019, with 73 episodes broadcast over eight seasons. \nSet on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos, Game of Thrones has several plots and a large ensemble cast and follows several story arcs. One arc is about the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms and follows a web of alliances and conflicts among the noble dynasties either vying to claim the throne or fighting for independence from it. Another focuses on the last descendant of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty, who has been exiled and is plotting a return to the throne, while another story arc follows the Night's Watch, a brotherhood defending the realm against the fierce peoples and legendary creatures of the North.\nGame of Thrones attracted a record viewership on HBO and has a broad, active, and international fan base. The series was acclaimed by critics for its acting, complex characters, story, scope, and production values, although its frequent use of nudity and violence (including sexual violence) was criticized; the final season received further criticism for its condensed story and creative decisions, with many considering it a disappointing conclusion. The series received 58 Primetime Emmy Awards, the most by a drama series, including Outstanding Drama Series in 2015, 2016, 2018, 2019. Its other awards and nominations include three Hugo Awards for Best Dramatic Presentation (2012\u20132014), a 2011 Peabody Award, and five nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series \u2013 Drama (2012 and 2015\u20132018).

"3.267","Gamergate controversy","","The Gamergate controversy stemmed from a harassment campaign conducted primarily through the use of the hashtag #GamerGate. The controversy centered on issues of sexism and progressivism in video game culture. Gamergate is used as a blanket term for the controversy as well as for the harassment campaign and actions of those participating in it.\nBeginning in August 2014, a harassment campaign targeted several women in the video game industry; notably game developers Zo\u00eb Quinn and Brianna Wu, as well as feminist media critic Anita Sarkeesian. After Eron Gjoni, Quinn's former boyfriend, wrote a disparaging blog post about Quinn, #gamergate hashtag users falsely accused Quinn of an unethical relationship with journalist Nathan Grayson. Harassment campaigns against Quinn and others included doxing, threats of rape, and death threats.\nGamergate proponents (""Gamergaters"") have stated that they were a movement, but had no official leaders or manifesto. Gamergate supporters organized anonymously or pseudonymously on online platforms such as 4chan, Internet Relay Chat, Twitter, and Reddit. Statements claiming to represent Gamergate have been inconsistent, making it difficult for commentators to identify goals and motives. Gamergate supporters said there was unethical collusion between the press and feminists, progressives, and social critics. These concerns have been dismissed by commentators as trivial, conspiracy theories, groundless, or unrelated to actual issues of ethics. As a result, Gamergate has often been defined by the harassment its supporters engaged in. Gamergate supporters have frequently responded to this by denying that the harassment took place or by falsely claiming that it was manufactured by the victims.\nThe controversy has been described as a manifestation of a culture war over cultural diversification, artistic recognition, and social criticism in video games, and over the social identity of gamers. Many supporters of Gamergate oppose what they view as the increasing influence of feminism on video game culture; as a result, Gamergate is often viewed as a right-wing backlash against progressivism. Industry responses to the harassment campaign have focused on ways to minimize harm and prevent similar events. Gamergate has led figures both inside and outside the industry to focus on methods of addressing online harassment.\n\n","wikipedia","['5.12','5.13']"
"3.269","Gay culture","","LGBT culture is a culture shared by lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning, and queer individuals. It is sometimes referred to as queer culture (indicating people who are queer), while the term gay culture may be used to mean ""LGBT culture"" or to refer specifically to homosexual culture.\nLGBT culture varies widely by geography and the identity of the participants. Elements common to cultures of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and intersex people include:\n\nWorks by famous gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people, including:\nContemporary LGBT artists and political figures\nHistorical figures identified as LGBT, although identifying historical figures with modern terms for sexual identity is controversial (see History of sexuality). However, many LGBT people feel a kinship with these people and their work (particularly that addressing same-sex attraction or gender identity); an example is VictoryFund.org, dedicated to supporting homosexual politicians.\nAn understanding of LGBT social movements\nFigures and identities present in the LGBT community; within LGBT communities in Western culture, this might include drag kings and queens, pride parades and the rainbow flag.Not all LGBT people identify with LGBT culture; this may be due to geographic distance, unawareness of the subculture's existence, fear of social stigma or a preference for remaining unidentified with sexuality- or gender-based subcultures or communities. The Queercore and Gay Shame movements critique what they see as the commercialization and self-imposed ""ghettoization"" of LGBT culture.In some cities, especially in North America, some LGBT people live in neighborhoods with a high proportion of gay residents, otherwise known as gay villages or gayborhoods, examples of this neighborhoods are Castro and West Hollywood in California, United States or Gay Village in Montreal, Canada. Such LGBT communities organize special events in addition to pride parades celebrating their culture such as the Gay Games and Southern Decadence.","wikipedia","5.13"
"3.268","Gay Marriage","","Same-sex marriage (also known as gay marriage) is the marriage of two people of the same sex or gender, entered into in a civil or religious ceremony. There are records of same-sex marriage dating back to the first century. In the modern era, same-sex marriage started being legalized at the beginning of the 21st century. Today, it is available in 28 countries.\nSame-sex marriage is legally performed and recognized (nationwide or in some jurisdictions) in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Ecuador, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Uruguay. Same-sex marriage is also due to become legal in Costa Rica. Israel recognizes same-sex marriages entered into abroad as full marriages. Furthermore, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights has issued a ruling that is expected to facilitate recognition in several countries in the Americas.The introduction of same-sex marriage (also called marriage equality) has varied by jurisdiction, and came about through legislative change to marriage law, court rulings based on constitutional guarantees of equality, recognition that it is allowed by existing marriage law, or by direct popular vote (via referendums and initiatives). The recognition of same-sex marriage is considered to be a human right and a civil right as well as a political, social, and religious issue. The most prominent supporters of same-sex marriage are human rights and civil rights organizations as well as the medical and scientific communities, while the most prominent opponents are religious fundamentalist groups. Polls consistently show continually rising support for the recognition of same-sex marriage in all developed democracies and in some developing democracies.\nScientific studies show that the financial, psychological, and physical well-being of gay people are enhanced by marriage, and that the children of same-sex parents benefit from being raised by married same-sex couples within a marital union that is recognized by law and supported by societal institutions. Social science research indicates that the exclusion of homosexuals from marriage stigmatizes and invites public discrimination against them, with research also repudiating the notion that either civilization or viable social orders depend upon restricting marriage to heterosexuals. Same-sex marriage can provide those in committed same-sex relationships with relevant government services and make financial demands on them comparable to that required of those in opposite-sex marriages, and also gives them legal protections such as inheritance and hospital visitation rights. Opposition to same-sex marriage is based on claims such as that homosexuality is unnatural and abnormal, that the recognition of same-sex unions will promote homosexuality in society, and that children are better off when raised by opposite-sex couples. These claims are refuted by scientific studies, which show that homosexuality is a natural and normal variation in human sexuality, and that sexual orientation is not a choice. Many studies have shown that children of same-sex couples fare just as well as the children of opposite-sex couples; some studies have shown benefits to being raised by same-sex couples.A study of nationwide data from across the United States from January 1999 to December 2015 revealed that the establishment of same-sex marriage is associated with a significant reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among children, with the effect being concentrated among children of a minority sexual orientation, resulting in about 134,000 fewer children attempting suicide each year in the United States.\n\n","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.270","Gay rights","","Rights affecting lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people vary greatly by country or jurisdiction \u2013 encompassing everything from the legal recognition of same-sex marriage to the death penalty for homosexuality.\nNotably, as of 2019, 28 countries recognize same-sex marriage, they are: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Ecuador, Finland, France, Germany, Greenland, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, the United States and Uruguay. By contrast, 6 countries effectively impose the death penalty on consensual same-sex sexual acts, with three in Asia (Iran, Saudi Arabia and Yemen) and three in Africa (Nigeria (the northern states), Sudan and Somalia (Jubaland region)). In addition, the death penalty is a possible punishment in 6 other countries: Afghanistan, Brunei, Mauritania, Pakistan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Iraq has been removed from this list following the elimination of the Islamic State (ISIL/ISIS), it remains as a ""de facto"" criminalising country due to reports of State prosecution using laws on public indecency, prostitution or others.In 2011, the United Nations Human Rights Council passed its first resolution recognizing LGBT rights, following which the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights issued a report documenting violations of the rights of LGBT people, including hate crimes, criminalization of homosexual activity, and discrimination. Following the issuance of the report, the United Nations urged all countries which had not yet done so to enact laws protecting basic LGBT rights.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.271","Gender","","Gender is the range of characteristics pertaining to, and differentiating between, masculinity and femininity. Depending on the context, these characteristics may include biological sex (i.e., the state of being male, female, or an intersex variation), sex-based social structures (i.e., gender roles), or gender identity. Most cultures use a gender binary, having two genders (boys/men and girls/women); those who exist outside these groups fall under the umbrella term non-binary or genderqueer. Some societies have specific genders besides ""man"" and ""woman"", such as the hijras of South Asia; these are often referred to as third genders (and fourth genders, etc.).\nSexologist John Money introduced the terminological distinction between biological sex and gender as a role in 1955. Before his work, it was uncommon to use the word gender to refer to anything but grammatical categories. However, Money's meaning of the word did not become widespread until the 1970s, when feminist theory embraced the concept of a distinction between biological sex and the social construct of gender. Today, the distinction is followed in some contexts, especially the social sciences and documents written by the World Health Organization (WHO).In other contexts, including some areas of the social sciences, gender includes sex or replaces it. For instance, in non-human animal research, gender is commonly used to refer to the biological sex of the animals. This change in the meaning of gender can be traced to the 1980s. In 1993, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) started to use gender instead of sex. Later, in 2011, the FDA reversed its position and began using sex as the biological classification and gender as ""a person's self representation as male or female, or how that person is responded to by social institutions based on the individual's gender presentation.""The social sciences have a branch devoted to gender studies. Other sciences, such as sexology and neuroscience, are also interested in the subject. The social sciences sometimes approach gender as a social construct, and gender studies particularly do, while research in the natural sciences investigates whether biological differences in males and females influence the development of gender in humans; both inform debate about how far biological differences influence the formation of gender identity. In some English literature, there is also a trichotomy between biological sex, psychological gender, and social gender role. This framework first appeared in a feminist paper on transsexualism in 1978.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.274","Genetically modified food","","Genetically modified foods (GM foods), also known as genetically engineered foods (GE foods), or bioengineered foods are foods produced from organisms that have had changes introduced into their DNA using the methods of genetic engineering. Genetic engineering techniques allow for the introduction of new traits as well as greater control over traits when compared to previous methods, such as selective breeding and mutation breeding.Commercial sale of genetically modified foods began in 1994, when Calgene first marketed its unsuccessful Flavr Savr delayed-ripening tomato. Most food modifications have primarily focused on cash crops in high demand by farmers such as soybean, corn, canola, and cotton. Genetically modified crops have been engineered for resistance to pathogens and herbicides and for better nutrient profiles. GM livestock have been developed, although, as of November 2013, none were on the market.There is a scientific consensus that currently available food derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food, but that each GM food needs to be tested on a case-by-case basis before introduction. Nonetheless, members of the public are much less likely than scientists to perceive GM foods as safe. The legal and regulatory status of GM foods varies by country, with some nations banning or restricting them, and others permitting them with widely differing degrees of regulation.However, there are ongoing public concerns related to food safety, regulation, labelling, environmental impact, research methods, and the fact that some GM seeds, along with all new plant varieties, are subject to plant breeders' rights owned by corporations.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.272","Genetic engineering","","Genetic engineering, also called genetic modification or genetic manipulation, is the direct manipulation of an organism's genes using biotechnology. It is a set of technologies used to change the genetic makeup of cells, including the transfer of genes within and across species boundaries to produce improved or novel organisms. New DNA is obtained by either isolating and copying the genetic material of interest using recombinant DNA methods or by artificially synthesising the DNA. A construct is usually created and used to insert this DNA into the host organism. The first recombinant DNA molecule was made by Paul Berg in 1972 by combining DNA from the monkey virus SV40 with the lambda virus. As well as inserting genes, the process can be used to remove, or ""knock out"", genes. The new DNA can be inserted randomly, or targeted to a specific part of the genome.\nAn organism that is generated through genetic engineering is considered to be genetically modified (GM) and the resulting entity is a genetically modified organism (GMO). The first GMO was a bacterium generated by Herbert Boyer and Stanley Cohen in 1973. Rudolf Jaenisch created the first GM animal when he inserted foreign DNA into a mouse in 1974. The first company to focus on genetic engineering, Genentech, was founded in 1976 and started the production of human proteins. Genetically engineered human insulin was produced in 1978 and insulin-producing bacteria were commercialised in 1982. Genetically modified food has been sold since 1994, with the release of the Flavr Savr tomato. The Flavr Savr was engineered to have a longer shelf life, but most current GM crops are modified to increase resistance to insects and herbicides. GloFish, the first GMO designed as a pet, was sold in the United States in December 2003. In 2016 salmon modified with a growth hormone were sold.\nGenetic engineering has been applied in numerous fields including research, medicine, industrial biotechnology and agriculture. In research GMOs are used to study gene function and expression through loss of function, gain of function, tracking and expression experiments. By knocking out genes responsible for certain conditions it is possible to create animal model organisms of human diseases. As well as producing hormones, vaccines and other drugs genetic engineering has the potential to cure genetic diseases through gene therapy. The same techniques that are used to produce drugs can also have industrial applications such as producing enzymes for laundry detergent, cheeses and other products.\nThe rise of commercialised genetically modified crops has provided economic benefit to farmers in many different countries, but has also been the source of most of the controversy surrounding the technology. This has been present since its early use; the first field trials were destroyed by anti-GM activists. Although there is a scientific consensus that currently available food derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food, GM food safety is a leading concern with critics. Gene flow, impact on non-target organisms, control of the food supply and intellectual property rights have also been raised as potential issues. These concerns have led to the development of a regulatory framework, which started in 1975. It has led to an international treaty, the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, that was adopted in 2000. Individual countries have developed their own regulatory systems regarding GMOs, with the most marked differences occurring between the US and Europe.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.273","Genetic sexual attraction","","Genetic sexual attraction is a concept in which a strong sexual attraction may develop between close blood relatives who first meet as adults. There is no direct evidence for genetic sexual attraction being an actual phenomenon and the hypothesis is regarded as pseudoscience.","wikipedia","5.7"
"3.275","Genital modification and mutilation","","The terms genital modification and genital mutilation can refer to permanent or temporary changes to human sex organs. Some forms of genital alteration are performed on adults with their informed consent at their own behest, usually for aesthetic reasons or to enhance stimulation. However, other forms are performed on people who do not give informed consent, including infants or children. Any of these procedures may be considered modifications or mutilations in different cultural contexts and by different groups of people.\n\n","wikipedia","5.7"
"3.276","Genocide","","Genocide is intentional action to destroy a people (usually defined as an ethnic, national, racial, or religious group) in whole or in part. The hybrid word ""genocide"" is a combination of the Greek word \u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 (""race, people"") and the Latin suffix -caedo (""act of killing""). The term genocide was coined by Raphael Lemkin in his 1944 book Axis Rule in Occupied Europe.The United Nations Genocide Convention, which was established in 1948, defines genocide as ""acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, as such"" including the killing of its members, causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group, deliberately imposing living conditions that seek to ""bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part"", preventing births, or forcibly transferring children out of the group to another group.The term has been coined and applied to the Holocaust, the Armenian Genocide and many other mass killings including the genocide of indigenous peoples in the Americas, the Greek genocide, the Assyrian genocide, the Serbian genocide, the Holodomor, the Indonesian genocide, the Guatemalan genocide, the 1971 Bangladesh genocide, the Cambodian genocide, and after 1980 the Bosnian genocide, the Anfal genocide, the Darfur genocide, the Rwandan genocide and the Rohingya genocide. Others are listed in Genocides in history and List of genocides by death toll.\nThe Political Instability Task Force estimated that, between 1956 and 2016, a total of 43 genocides took place, causing the death of about 50 million people. The UNHCR estimated that a further 50 million had been displaced by such episodes of violence up to 2008.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.277","Genocide denial","","Genocide denial is the  attempt to deny or minimize statements of the scale and severity of an incidence of genocide. Richard G. Hovannisian defines the denial as the final stage of a genocidal process and the erasing of the memories of the victim group: ""Following the physical destruction of a people and their material culture, memory is all that is left and is targeted as the last victim. Complete annihilation of a people requires the banishment of recollection and suffocation of remembrance. Falsification, deception and half-truths reduce what was to what might have been or perhaps what was not at all."" This denial of genocide is usually considered a form of illegitimate historical revisionism. The distinction between respectable academic historians and those of illegitimate historical revisionists rests on the techniques used to write such histories. Accuracy and revision are central to historical scholarship. As in any academic discipline, historians' papers are submitted to peer review. Instead of submitting their work to the challenges of peer review, illegitimate revisionists rewrite history to support an agenda, often political, using any number of techniques and rhetorical fallacies to obtain their results.\nThe European Commission proposed a European Union\u2013wide anti-racism law in 2001, which included an offense of genocide denial, but European Union states failed to agree on the balance between prohibiting racism and freedom of expression. After six years of wrangling  a watered down compromise was reached in 2007 giving states freedom to implement the legislation as they saw fit.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.278","Gentrification","","Gentrification is a process of changing the character of a neighborhood through the influx of more affluent residents and businesses. This is a common and controversial topic in politics and in urban planning. Gentrification often increases the economic value of a neighborhood, but the resulting demographic change is frequently a cause of controversy.\nGentrification often shifts a neighborhood's racial/ethnic composition and average household income by developing new, more expensive housing, businesses and improved resources. The gentrification process is typically the result of increasing attraction to an area by people with higher incomes spilling over from neighboring cities, towns, or neighborhoods. Further steps are increased investments in a community and the related infrastructure by real estate development businesses, local government, or community activists and resulting economic development, increased attraction of business, and lower crime rates. In addition to these potential benefits, gentrification can lead to population migration and displacement. However, some view the fear of displacement, which is dominating the debate about gentrification, as hindering discussion about genuine progressive approaches to distribute the benefits of urban redevelopment strategies.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.279","Gerontophilia","","Gerontophilia is the primary sexual attraction to the elderly. A person with such a sexual preference is a gerontophile. The word gerontophilia was coined in 1901 by psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing. It derives from Greek: geron, meaning ""old person"" and philie, meaning ""love"". Gerontophilia is classified as a paraphilia, but is not mentioned in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or International Classification of Diseases.The prevalence of gerontophilia is unknown. A study of pornographic search terms on a peer-to-peer network reported that 0.15% had gerontophilic themes. Sex offenders with elderly victims do not necessarily have gerontophilia. There are other possible motivations for these offenses, such as rage or sadism, or the increased vulnerability of elderly as a social group, which are factors that may not involve a sexual preference for the elderly. There are no studies showing that most such offenders are gerontophiles. In one small study, two of six sex offenders against the elderly evinced gerontophilic tendencies. Gerontophilia can also be expressed with consenting elderly partners in a legal context.Research on gerontophilia is limited to a small number of case studies, beginning with a paper by French physician Charles F\u00e9r\u00e9 in 1905. F\u00e9r\u00e9 described a 27-year-old man who rejected an arranged marriage with a 20-year-old ""beauty"" in favor of a 62-year-old woman. Such studies commonly report that the subject had an early sexual experience with a much older woman.","wikipedia","5.7"
"3.280","Girls Gone Wild (franchise)","","Girls Gone Wild  (GGW) is an entertainment franchise created by Joe Francis in 1997, who occasionally appears as the host of the videos.\nGirls Gone Wild was known for its early use of direct-response marketing techniques, including its late-night infomercials that began airing in 1997. The videos typically involve camera crews at party locations engaging young college-aged women who expose their bodies or act ""wild"", especially during Spring break. Since 2008, the Girls Gone Wild products have been sold primarily through their website as streaming videos, downloads, and DVDs.\nIn February 2013, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.","wikipedia","5.12"
"3.281","Global warming","","Global warming is the long-term rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system. It is a major aspect of climate change and has been demonstrated by direct temperature measurements and by measurements of various effects of the warming. Global warming and climate change are often used interchangeably. But, more accurately, global warming is the mainly human-caused increase in global surface temperatures and its projected continuation, while climate change includes both global warming and its effects, such as changes in precipitation. While there have been prehistoric periods of global warming, observed changes since the mid-20th century have been unprecedented in rate and scale.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report concluded, ""It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century"". The largest human influence has been the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. Fossil fuel burning is the dominant source of these gases, with agricultural emissions and deforestation also playing significant roles. These findings have been recognized by the national science academies of the major industrialized nations and are not disputed by any scientific body of national or international standing.The effects of global warming include rising sea levels, regional changes in precipitation, more frequent extreme weather events such as heat waves, and expansion of deserts. Surface temperature increases are greatest in the Arctic, which have contributed to the retreat of glaciers, permafrost, and sea ice. Overall, higher temperatures bring more rain and snowfall, but for some regions droughts and wildfires increase instead. Climate change threatens to diminish crop yields, harming food security, and rising sea levels may flood coastal infrastructure and force the abandonment of many coastal cities. Environmental impacts include the extinction or relocation of many species as their ecosystems change, most immediately in coral reefs, mountains, and the Arctic. Some impacts, such as loss of snow cover, increased water vapour, and melting permafrost, cause feedback effects that further increase the rate of global warming. Ocean acidification caused by increased CO2 levels is commonly grouped with these effects even though it is not driven by temperature.\nMitigation efforts to address global warming include the development and deployment of low carbon energy technologies, policies to reduce fossil fuel emissions, reforestation, forest preservation, as well as the development of potential climate engineering technologies. Societies and governments are also working to adapt to current and future global warming impacts, including improved coastline protection, better disaster management, and the development of more resistant crops. \nCountries work together on climate change under the umbrella of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which entered into force in 1994 and has near-universal membership. The ultimate goal of the convention is to ""prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system"". Although the parties to the UNFCCC have agreed that deep cuts in emissions are required and that global warming should be limited to well below 2 \u00b0C (3.6 \u00b0F) in the Paris Agreement of 2016, the Earth's average surface temperature has already increased by about half this threshold. With current policies and pledges, global warming by the end of the century is expected to reach just over 2 \u00b0C to 4 \u00b0C, depending on how sensitive the climate is to emissions. The IPCC has stressed the need to keep global warming below 1.5 \u00b0C compared to pre-industrial levels in order to avoid irreversible impacts. At the current greenhouse gas (GHG) emission rate of 42 gigatons (Gt) per year, the carbon budget for staying below 1.5\u00b0C would be exhausted by 2028.\n\n","wikipedia","5.9"
"3.282","Glyphosate","","Glyphosate (IUPAC name: N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine) is a broad-spectrum systemic herbicide and crop desiccant. It is an organophosphorus compound, specifically a phosphonate, which acts by inhibiting the plant enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase. It is used to kill weeds, especially annual broadleaf weeds and grasses that compete with crops. It was discovered to be an herbicide by Monsanto chemist John E. Franz in 1970. Monsanto brought it to market for agricultural use in 1974 under the trade name Roundup. Monsanto's last commercially relevant United States patent expired in 2000.\nFarmers quickly adopted glyphosate for agricultural weed control, especially after Monsanto introduced glyphosate-resistant Roundup Ready crops, enabling farmers to kill weeds without killing their crops. In 2007, glyphosate was the most used herbicide in the United States' agricultural sector and the second-most used (after 2,4-D) in home and garden, government and industry, and commercial applications. From the late 1970s to 2016, there was a 100-fold increase in the frequency and volume of application of glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) worldwide, with further increases expected in the future. This was partly in response to the global emergence and spread of glyphosate-resistant weeds, requiring greater application to maintain effectiveness. The development of glyphosate resistance in weed species is emerging as a costly problem.\nGlyphosate is absorbed through foliage, and minimally through roots, and transported to growing points. It inhibits a plant enzyme involved in the synthesis of three aromatic amino acids: tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine. It is therefore effective only on actively growing plants and is not effective as a pre-emergence herbicide. An increasing number of crops have been genetically engineered to be tolerant of glyphosate (e.g. Roundup Ready soybean, the first Roundup Ready crop, also created by Monsanto), which allows farmers to use glyphosate as a post-emergence herbicide against weeds.\nWhile glyphosate and formulations such as Roundup have been approved by regulatory bodies worldwide, concerns about their effects on humans and the environment persist, and have grown as the global usage of glyphosate increases. A number of regulatory and scholarly reviews have evaluated the relative toxicity of glyphosate as an herbicide. The German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment toxicology review in 2013 found that ""the available data is contradictory and far from being convincing"" with regard to correlations between exposure to glyphosate formulations and risk of various cancers, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). A meta-analysis published in 2014 identified an increased risk of NHL in workers exposed to glyphosate formulations.In March 2015, the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified glyphosate as ""probably carcinogenic in humans"" (category 2A) based on epidemiological studies, animal studies, and in vitro studies.  In contrast, the European Food Safety Authority concluded in November 2015 that ""the substance is unlikely to be genotoxic (i.e. damaging to DNA) or to pose a carcinogenic threat to humans"", later clarifying that while carcinogenic glyphosate-containing formulations may exist, studies ""that look solely at the active substance glyphosate do not show this effect."" The WHO and FAO Joint committee on pesticide residues issued a report in 2016 stating the use of glyphosate formulations does not necessarily constitute a health risk, and giving admissible daily maximum intake limits (one milligram/kg of body weight per day) for chronic toxicity. The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) classified glyphosate as causing serious eye damage and toxic to aquatic life, but did not find evidence implicating it as a carcinogen, a mutagen, toxic to reproduction, nor toxic to specific organs.\n\n","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.283","Gnosticism and the New Testament","","Gnosticism (from Ancient Greek: \u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 gn\u014dstik\u00f3s, Koine Greek: [\u0261\u02e0no\u031es.ti\u02c8kos], ""having knowledge"") is a collection of ancient religious ideas and systems which originated in the first century AD among early Christian and Jewish sects. These various groups, labeled ""Gnostics"" by their opponents, emphasised personal spiritual knowledge (gnosis) over orthodox teachings, traditions, and ecclesiastical authority. They considered the principal element of salvation to be direct knowledge of the supreme divinity, experienced as mystical or esoteric insight. Generally, Gnostic cosmogony presents a distinction between this supreme, hidden God and a blind, evil demiurge responsible for creating the material universe, thereby trapping the divine spark within matter. Many Gnostic texts deal not in concepts of sin and repentance, but with illusion and enlightenment.Gnostic writings flourished among certain Christian groups in the Mediterranean world until about the second century, when the Fathers of the early church denounced them as heresy. Efforts to destroy supposedly heretical texts proved largely successful, resulting in the survival of very few Gnostic texts. Nonetheless, early Gnostic teachers such as Valentinus saw their beliefs as aligned with Christianity. In the Gnostic Christian tradition, Christ is seen as a divine being which has taken human form in order to lead humanity back to the Light. However, Gnosticism is not a single standardized system, and the emphasis on direct experience allows for a wide variety of teachings, including distinct currents such as Valentianism and Sethianism. In the Persian Empire, Gnostic ideas spread as far as China via the related movement Manichaeism, while Mandaeism is still alive in Iraq.\nFor centuries, most scholarly knowledge of Gnosticism was limited to the anti-heretical writings of orthodox Christian figures such as Irenaeus of Lyons and Hippolytus of Rome. Renewed interest in Gnosticism occurred after the 1945 discovery of Egypt's Nag Hammadi library, a collection of rare early Christian and Gnostic texts, including the Gospel of Thomas and the Apocryphon of John. A major question in scholarly research is the qualification of Gnosticism as either an interreligious phenomenon or as an independent religion. Scholars have acknowledged the influence of sources such as Hellenistic Judaism and Platonism, and some have noted possible links to Buddhism and Hinduism, though the evidence of direct influence from these latter sources is inconclusive.","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.264","GNU/Linux naming controversy","","The GNU/Linux naming controversy is a dispute between members of the free software community and open-source software community over whether to refer to computer operating systems that use a combination of GNU software and the Linux kernel as ""GNU/Linux"" or ""Linux"". Proponents of the term Linux argue that it is far more commonly used by the public and media, and that it serves as a generic term for systems that combine that kernel with software from multiple other sources.Proponents of the term GNU/Linux note that GNU alone would be just as good a name for GNU variants which combine the GNU operating system software with software from other sources. GNU/Linux is a term promoted by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and its founder Richard Stallman. Proponents call for the correction of the more extended term, on the grounds that it doesn't give credit to the major contributor and the associated free software philosophy. GNU is a longstanding project begun in 1984 to develop a free operating system. It is argued that when the Linux kernel was independently created in 1991, it merely provided a substantial missing piece. Several distributions employ the FSF-endorsed name, such as Debian, Trisquel and Parabola GNU/Linux-libre.","wikipedia","5.4"
"3.284","God","","In monotheistic thought, God is conceived of as the supreme being, creator deity, and principal object of faith. God is usually conceived as being omniscient (all-knowing), omnipotent (all-powerful), omnipresent (all-present) and as having an eternal and necessary existence. These attributes are used either in way of analogy or are taken literally. God is most often held to be incorporeal (immaterial). Incorporeality and corporeality of God are related to conceptions of transcendence (being outside nature) and immanence (being in nature) of God, with positions of synthesis such as the ""immanent transcendence"".\nSome religions describe God without reference to gender, while others or their translations use terminology that is gender-specific and gender-biased.\nGod has been conceived as either personal or impersonal. In theism, God is the creator and sustainer of the universe, while in deism, God is the creator, but not the sustainer, of the universe. In pantheism, God is the universe itself. In atheism, there is an absence of belief in God. In agnosticism, the existence of God is deemed unknown or unknowable. God has also been conceived as the source of all moral obligation, and the ""greatest conceivable existent"". Many notable philosophers have developed arguments for and against the existence of God.Monotheists refer to their gods using names prescribed by their respective religions, with some of these names referring to certain cultural ideas about their god's identity and attributes. In the ancient Egyptian era of Atenism, possibly the earliest recorded monotheistic religion, this deity was called Aten, premised on being the one ""true"" Supreme Being and creator of the universe. In the Hebrew Bible and Judaism, Elohim, Adonai, YHWH (Hebrew: \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4\u200e) and other names are used as the names of God. Yahweh and Jehovah, possible vocalizations of YHWH, are used in Christianity. In the Christian doctrine of the Trinity, God, coexisting in three ""persons"", is called the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. In Islam, the name Allah is used, while Muslims also have a multitude of titular names for God. In Hinduism, Brahman is often considered a monistic concept of God. In Chinese religion, Shangdi is conceived as the progenitor (first ancestor) of the universe, intrinsic to it and constantly bringing order to it. Other religions have names for the concept of God, including Baha in the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith, Waheguru in Sikhism, Sang Hyang Widhi Wasa in Balinese Hinduism, and Ahura Mazda in Zoroastrianism.The many different conceptions of God, and competing claims as to God's characteristics, aims, and actions, have led to the development of ideas of omnitheism, pandeism, or a perennial philosophy, which postulates that there is one underlying theological truth, of which all religions express a partial understanding, and as to which ""the devout in the various great world religions are in fact worshipping that one God, but through different, overlapping concepts"".","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.285","Golf","","Golf is a club-and-ball sport in which players use various clubs to hit balls into a series of holes on a course in as few strokes as possible.\nGolf, unlike most ball games, cannot and does not utilize a standardized playing area, and coping with the varied terrains encountered on different courses is a key part of the game. The game at the usual level is played on a course with an arranged progression of 18 holes, though recreational courses can be smaller, often having nine holes. Each hole on the course must contain a tee box to start from, and a putting green containing the actual hole or cup 4 1\u20444 inches (11 cm) in diameter. There are other standard forms of terrain in between, such as the fairway, rough (long grass), bunkers (or ""sand traps""), and various hazards (water, rocks) but each hole on a course is unique in its specific layout and arrangement.\nGolf is played for the lowest number of strokes by an individual, known as stroke play, or the lowest score on the most individual holes in a complete round by an individual or team, known as match play. Stroke play is the most commonly seen format at all levels, but most especially at the elite level.\nThe modern game of golf originated in 15th century Scotland. The 18-hole round was created at the Old Course at St Andrews in 1764. Golf's first major, and the world's oldest tournament in existence, is The Open Championship, also known as the British Open, which was first played in 1860 in Ayrshire, Scotland. This is one of the four major championships in men's professional golf, the other three being played in the United States: The Masters, the U.S. Open, and the PGA Championship.","wikipedia","5.11"
"3.286","Google","","Google LLC is an American multinational technology company that specializes in Internet-related services and products, which include online advertising technologies, search engine, cloud computing, software, and hardware. It is considered one of the Big Four technology companies, alongside Amazon, Apple, and Facebook.Google was founded in September 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University in California. Together they own about 14 percent of its shares and control 56 percent of the stockholder voting power through supervoting stock. They incorporated Google as a California privately held company on September 4, 1998, in California. Google was then reincorporated in Delaware on October 22, 2002. An initial public offering (IPO) took place on August 19, 2004, and Google moved to its headquarters in Mountain View, California, nicknamed the  Googleplex. In August 2015, Google announced plans to reorganize its various interests as a conglomerate called Alphabet Inc. Google is Alphabet's leading subsidiary and will continue to be the umbrella company for Alphabet's Internet interests. Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google, replacing Larry Page who became the CEO of Alphabet.\nThe company's rapid growth since incorporation has triggered a chain of products, acquisitions, and partnerships beyond Google's core search engine (Google Search). It offers services designed for work and productivity (Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Slides), email (Gmail), scheduling and time management (Google Calendar), cloud storage (Google Drive), instant messaging and video chat (Duo, Hangouts), language translation (Google Translate), mapping and navigation (Google Maps, Waze, Google Earth, Street View), video sharing (YouTube), note-taking (Google Keep), and photo organizing and editing (Google Photos). The company leads the development of the Android mobile operating system, the Google Chrome web browser, and Chrome OS, a lightweight operating system based on the Chrome browser. Google has moved increasingly into hardware; from 2010 to 2015, it partnered with major electronics manufacturers in the production of its Nexus devices, and it released multiple hardware products in October 2016, including the Google Pixel smartphone, Google Home smart speaker, Google Wifi mesh wireless router, and Google Daydream virtual reality headset. Google has also experimented with becoming an Internet carrier (Google Fiber, Google Fi, and Google Station).Google.com is the most visited website in the world. Several other Google services also figure in the top 100 most visited websites, including YouTube and Blogger. Google was the most valuable brand in the world as of 2017, but has received significant criticism involving issues such as privacy concerns, tax avoidance, antitrust, censorship, and search neutrality. Google's mission statement is ""to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful"". The company's unofficial slogan ""Don't be evil"" was removed from the company's code of conduct around May 2018, but reinstated by July 31, 2018.","wikipedia","5.13"

"3.288","Goth subculture","","The goth subculture is a subculture that began in England during the early 1980s, where it developed from the audience of gothic rock, an offshoot of the post-punk genre. The name, goth subculture, was derived directly from the music genre. Notable post-punk groups that presaged that genre and helped develop and shape the subculture, include Siouxsie and the Banshees, Joy Division, Bauhaus and The Cure. The goth subculture has survived much longer than others of the same era, and has continued to diversify and spread throughout the world. Its imagery and cultural proclivities indicate influences from 19th-century Gothic literature and gothic horror films. The scene is centered on music festivals, nightclubs and organized meetings, especially in Western Europe.\nThe goth subculture has associated tastes in music, aesthetics, and fashion. The music preferred by the goth subculture includes a number of different styles, e.g. gothic rock, death rock, post-punk, cold wave, dark wave, and ethereal wave. Styles of dress within the subculture draw on punk, new wave and new romantic fashion as well as fashion of earlier periods such as the Victorian and Edwardian eras (Belle \u00c9poque), or combinations of the above.  The style usually includes dark attire (often black), dark makeup and black hair. The subculture continues to draw interest from a large audience decades after its emergence.","wikipedia","5.13"
"3.289","Graeco-Armenian","","Graeco-Armenian (or Helleno-Armenian) is the hypothetical common ancestor of Greek and Armenian that postdates Proto-Indo-European. Its status is somewhat similar to that of the Italo-Celtic grouping: each is widely considered plausible without being accepted as established communis opinio.

"3.290","Great Depression","","The Great Depression was a severe worldwide economic depression that took place mostly during the 1930s, beginning in the United States. The timing of the Great Depression varied across nations; in most countries, it started in 1929 and lasted until the late 1930s. It was the longest, deepest, and most widespread depression of the 20th century. The Great Depression is commonly used as an example of how intensely the world's economy can decline.The Great Depression started in the United States after a major fall in stock prices that began around September 4, 1929, and became worldwide news with the stock market crash of October 29, 1929, (known as Black Tuesday). Between 1929 and 1932, worldwide gross domestic product (GDP) fell by an estimated 15%. By comparison, worldwide GDP fell by less than 1% from 2008 to 2009 during the Great Recession. Some economies started to recover by the mid-1930s. However, in many countries, the negative effects of the Great Depression lasted until the beginning of World War II.The Great Depression had devastating effects in countries both rich and poor. Personal income, tax revenue, profits and prices dropped, while international trade plunged by more than 50%. Unemployment in the U.S. rose to 25% and in some countries rose as high as 33%.Cities around the world were hit hard, especially those dependent on heavy industry. Construction was virtually halted in many countries. Farming communities and rural areas suffered as crop prices fell by about 60%. Facing plummeting demand with few alternative sources of jobs, areas dependent on primary sector industries such as mining and logging suffered the most.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.291","Green Revolution","","The Green Revolution, or Third Agricultural Revolution, is a set of research technology transfer initiatives occurring between 1950 and the late 1960s, that increased agricultural production worldwide, particularly in the developing world, beginning most markedly in the late 1960s. The initiatives resulted in the adoption of new technologies, including high-yielding varieties (HYVs) of cereals, especially dwarf wheats and rices, in association with chemical fertilizers and agro-chemicals, and with controlled water-supply (usually involving irrigation) and new methods of cultivation, including mechanization. All of these together were seen as a 'package of practices' to supersede 'traditional' technology and to be adopted as a whole.Both the Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation were heavily involved in its initial development in Mexico. \nOne key leader was Norman Borlaug, the ""Father of the Green Revolution"", who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970. He is credited with saving over a billion people from starvation. The basic approach was the development of high-yielding varieties of cereal grains, expansion of irrigation infrastructure, modernization of management techniques, distribution of hybridized seeds, synthetic fertilizers, and pesticides to farmers.\nThe term ""Green Revolution"" was first used in a speech on 8 March 1968 by the administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), William S. Gaud, who noted the spread of the new technologies: ""These and other developments in the field of agriculture contain the makings of a new revolution. It is not a violent Red Revolution like that of the Soviets, nor is it a White Revolution like that of the Shah of Iran. I call it the Green Revolution.""","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.263","G-Spot","","The G-spot, also called the Gr\u00e4fenberg spot (for German gynecologist Ernst Gr\u00e4fenberg), is characterized as an erogenous area of the vagina that, when stimulated, may lead to strong sexual arousal, powerful orgasms and potential female ejaculation. It is typically reported to be located 5\u20138 cm (2\u20133 in) up the front (anterior) vaginal wall between the vaginal opening and the urethra and is a sensitive area that may be part of the female prostate.The existence of the G-spot has not been proven, nor has the source of female ejaculation. Although the G-spot has been studied since the 1940s, disagreement persists over its existence as a distinct structure, definition and location. The G-spot may be an extension of the clitoris, which together may be the cause of orgasms experienced vaginally. Sexologists and other researchers are concerned that women may consider themselves to be dysfunctional if they do not experience G-spot stimulation, and emphasize that not experiencing it is normal.","wikipedia","5.7"
"3.293","Gun control","","Gun control (or firearms regulation) is the set of laws or policies that regulate the manufacture, sale, transfer, possession, modification, or use of firearms by civilians.\nMost countries have a restrictive firearm guiding policy, with only a few legislations being categorized as permissive. Jurisdictions that regulate access to firearms typically restrict access to only certain categories of firearms and then to restrict the categories of persons who will be granted a license to have access to a firearm. In some countries such as the United States, gun control may be legislated at either a federal level or a local state level.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.292","Gun Control in the Third Reich (book)","","Gun Control in the Third Reich is a non-fiction book by lawyer Stephen Halbrook. It describes the gun control policies used in Germany from the 1918 Weimar Republic, through the  Third Reich in 1938. The book aims to substantiate the Nazi gun control theory of gun politics in the United States by referencing German archives, diaries, and newspapers that attest to restrictions on firearm ownership for Jews and enemies of the state. It is published by the Independent Institute \nHalbrook is a lawyer involved in Second Amendment and gun control litigation on behalf of the National Rifle Association.In an interview in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Halbrook said that he decided to research the topic because ""Nobody has ever researched it. I first heard about it when I was an undergraduate in college in 1968, and there were these gun registration bills proposed in Congress. [...] The proponents of the bill challenged that and said they actually had commissioned a Library of Congress study saying there was no use of gun registration lists by the Nazis, either in Germany or in occupied countries, which was blatantly stupid. When (the Nazis) took power in 1933, they immediately used the (gun registration) records to disarm political enemies.""In a November 2013 review of the book in The New Republic, senior editor Alec MacGillis said Halbrook told him that he wanted the book to be seen as a scholarly work. As for analogies between Nazi gun laws and today's gun control debates, Halbrook said: ""The Nazis thought it was really important to disarm political enemies and Jews, but as far as contemporary comparisons, I\u2019m very aware of how loosely people use these comparisons, and it does a disservice to the victims of the Holocaust.""","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.294","Gun politics","","Gun laws and policies (collectively referred to as firearms regulation or gun control) regulate the manufacture, sale, transfer, possession, modification and use of small arms by civilians. Yemen and the majority of U.S. states do not require any permit for acquisition of a majority of types of firearms, meaning that any non-prohibited person can buy them from licensed dealers. Austria, Liechtenstein and Switzerland are partially licensed meaning that any non-prohibited citizen can buy repeating rifles and break-action shotguns from licensed dealers and a permit is only required for handguns and semi-automatic firearms. Out of the remaining countries, some require a shall-issue license (e.g. Canada, Czech Republic, and Malta), which is issued to people who meet all legal requirements. Typically in shall-issue countries, in order to deny license, authorities must prove that someone has violated legal conditions. In countries with may-issue licensing laws (e.g. India, South Africa, and Thailand), authorities have discretion at determining whether a person may obtain firearms. In some countries only very limited groups of people can own them (e.g. China, Japan, Myanmar). In few countries, including Cambodia, Eritrea, and Solomon Islands, ownership of firearms is completely prohibited.\nCountries with a strong gun culture may afford civilians a right to keep and bear arms, and have more liberal gun laws than neighboring jurisdictions. Countries which regulate access to firearms will typically restrict access to certain categories of firearms and then restrict the categories of persons who may be granted a license for access to such firearms. There may be separate licenses for hunting, sport shooting (a.k.a. target shooting), self-defense, collecting, and concealed carry, with different sets of requirements, permissions, and responsibilities.\nGun laws are often enacted with the intention of reducing the use of small arms in criminal activity, specifying weapons perceived as being capable of inflicting the greatest damage and those most-easily concealed, such as handguns and other short-barreled weapons. Persons restricted from legal access to firearms may include those below a certain age or having a criminal record. Firearm licenses may be denied to those felt most at risk of harming themselves or others, such as persons with a history of domestic violence, alcoholism or substance abuse, mental illness, depression, or attempted suicide. Those applying for a firearm license may have to demonstrate competence by completing a gun-safety course and show provision for a secure location to store weapons.\nThe legislation which restricts small arms may also restrict other weapons, such as explosives, crossbows, swords, electroshock weapons, air guns, and pepper spray. It may also restrict firearm accessories, notably high-capacity magazines and sound suppressors. There may be restrictions on the quantity or types of ammunition purchased, with certain types prohibited. Due to the global scope of this article, detailed coverage cannot be provided on all these matters; the article will instead attempt to briefly summarize each country's weapon laws in regard to small arms use and ownership by civilians. A 2016 review of studies from 10 countries found that stronger laws regulating firearms is associated with a reduction in firearm-related deaths, including suicides. A 2017 review found that in the US, stronger firearm laws are associated with a reduction in the rate of firearm homicides.\n\n","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.295","Guru","","Guru (, UK also ; Sanskrit: \u0917\u0941\u0930\u0941, IAST: guru) is a Sanskrit term for a ""teacher, guide, expert, or master"" of certain knowledge or field. In pan-Indian traditions, guru is more than a teacher, in Sanskrit guru means the one who dispels the darkness and takes towards light, traditionally a reverential figure to the student, with the guru serving as a ""counselor, who helps mold values, shares experiential knowledge as much as literal knowledge, an exemplar in life, an inspirational source and who helps in the spiritual evolution of a student"". A guru is also one's spiritual guide, who helps one to discover the same potentialities that the guru has already realized. In the Tagalog language, Indonesian and Malay the word means teacher.\nThe oldest references to the concept of guru are found in the earliest Vedic texts of Hinduism. The guru, and gurukul \u2013 a school run by guru, were an established tradition in India by the 1st millennium BCE, and these helped compose and transmit the various Vedas, the Upanishads, texts of various schools of Hindu philosophy, and post-Vedic Shastras ranging from spiritual knowledge to various arts. By about mid 1st millennium CE, archaeological and epigraphical evidence suggest numerous larger institutions of gurus existed in India, some near Hindu temples, where guru-shishya tradition helped preserve, create and transmit various fields of knowledge. These gurus led broad ranges of studies including Hindu scriptures, Buddhist texts, grammar, philosophy, martial arts, music and painting.The tradition of guru is also found in Jainism, referring to a spiritual preceptor, a role typically served by a Jain ascetic. In Sikhism, the guru tradition has played a key role since its founding in the 15th century, its founder is referred to as Guru Nanak, and its scripture as Guru Granth Sahib. The guru concept has thrived in Vajray\u0101na Buddhism, where the tantric guru is considered a figure to worship and whose instructions should never be violated.In the Western world, the term is sometimes used in a derogatory way to refer to individuals who have allegedly exploited their followers' naivet\u00e9, particularly in certain tantra schools, self-help, hippie and new religious movements.","wikipedia","5.1"

It has a social service wing, Dawah, and a military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades. It has been the de facto governing authority of the Gaza Strip since its takeover of that area in 2007. During this period it fought several wars with Israel. Israel, the United States and the European Union classify, either in whole or in part, Hamas as a terrorist organization. This classification is one among various and diverse international positions on the nature of Hamas.  Russia, China, and Turkey are some countries who view Hamas in a positive light.Hamas was founded in 1987, soon after the First Intifada broke out, as an offshoot of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, which in its Gaza branch had been non-confrontational towards Israel, refrained from resistance, and was hostile to the PLO. Co-founder Sheik Ahmed Yassin stated in 1987, and the Hamas Charter affirmed in 1988, that Hamas was founded to liberate Palestine, including modern-day Israel, from Israeli occupation and to establish an Islamic state in the area that is now Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The group has stated that it may accept a 10-year truce if Israel withdraws to the 1967 borders and allows Palestinian refugees from 1948, including their descendants, to return to what is now Israel, although clarifying that this does not mean recognition of Israel or the end of the conflict. Hamas's military wing objected to the truce offer.The military wing of Hamas has launched attacks against Israeli civilians and soldiers, often describing them as retaliatory, in particular for assassinations of the upper echelon of their leadership. Tactics have included suicide bombings and, since 2001, rocket attacks. Hamas's rocket arsenal, though mainly consisting of short-range homemade Qassam rockets, also includes long-range weapons that have reached major Israeli cities including Tel Aviv and Haifa. The attacks on civilians have been condemned as war crimes and crimes against humanity by human rights groups such as Human Rights Watch. A 2017 Palestinian Center for Public Opinion poll in the Palestinian territories revealed that Hamas violence and rhetoric against Israelis are unpopular and that a majority of Palestinians would rather Hamas ""accept a permanent two-state solution based on the 1967 borders.""In the January 2006 Palestinian parliamentary elections, Hamas won a plurality in the Palestinian Parliament, defeating the PLO-affiliated Fatah party. Following the elections, the Quartet (the United States, Russia, United Nations, and European Union) made future foreign assistance to the PA conditional upon the future government's commitment to non-violence, recognition of the state of Israel, and acceptance of previous agreements. Hamas rejected those changes, which led to the Quartet suspending its foreign assistance program and Israel imposing economic sanctions on the Hamas-led administration. In March 2007, a national unity government headed by Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh of Hamas was briefly formed, but this failed to restart international financial assistance. Tensions over control of Palestinian security forces soon erupted in the 2007 Battle of Gaza, after which Hamas took control of Gaza, while its officials were ousted from government positions in the West Bank. Israel and Egypt then imposed an economic blockade of the Gaza Strip, on the grounds that Fatah forces were no longer providing security there.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.300","Han unification","","Han unification is an effort by the authors of Unicode and the Universal Character Set to map multiple character sets of the so-called CJK languages into a single set of unified characters. Han characters are a common feature of written Chinese (hanzi), Japanese (kanji), and Korean (hanja).\nModern Chinese, Japanese and Korean typefaces typically use regional or historical variants of a given Han character. In the formulation of Unicode, an attempt was made to unify these variants by considering them different glyphs representing the same ""grapheme"", or orthographic unit, hence, ""Han unification"", with the resulting character repertoire sometimes contracted to Unihan.Unihan can also refer to the Unihan Database maintained by the Unicode Consortium, which provides information about all of the unified Han characters encoded in the Unicode Standard, including mappings to various national and industry standards, indices into standard dictionaries, encoded variants, pronunciations in various languages, and an English definition. The database is available to the public as text files and via an interactive website.\nThe latter also includes representative glyphs and definitions for compound words drawn from the free Japanese EDICT and Chinese CEDICT dictionary projects (which are provided for convenience and are not a formal part of the Unicode Standard).\n\n","wikipedia","5.4"
"3.301","Hard rock","","Hard rock, a loosely-defined subgenre of rock music, began in the mid-1960s with the garage, psychedelic and blues rock movements. It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals,  distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, and  drums,  sometimes accompanied with keyboards.\nHard rock developed into a major form of popular music in the 1970s, with  bands such as  the Who, Boston, Led Zeppelin,  Deep Purple, Aerosmith, Kiss, Queen, AC/DC and Van Halen. During the 1980s, some hard-rock bands moved away from their hard-rock roots and more towards pop rock,\nEstablished bands made a comeback in the mid-1980s and hard rock reached a commercial peak in the 1980s, with glam metal bands like Bon Jovi, and Def Leppard and the rawer sounds of Guns N' Roses, which followed up with great success in the later part of that decade. Hard rock began losing popularity with the commercial success of R&B,  hip-hop, urban pop, grunge and later Britpop in the 1990s.\nDespite this, many post-grunge bands adopted a hard-rock sound, and the 2000s saw a renewed interest in established bands, attempts at a revival, and new hard-rock bands that emerged from the garage rock and post-punk revival scenes. Out of this movement came garage rock bands like the White Stripes, the Strokes,  Interpol and, later on, the Black Keys. In the 2000s only a few hard-rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s managed to sustain highly successful recording careers.","wikipedia","5.13"

"3.303","Harry Potter","","Harry Potter is a series of fantasy novels written by British author J. K. Rowling. The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc concerns Harry's struggle against Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic and subjugate all wizards and Muggles (non-magical people).\nSince the release of the first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, on 26 June 1997, the books have found immense popularity, critical acclaim and commercial success worldwide. They have attracted a wide adult audience as well as younger readers and are often considered cornerstones of modern young adult literature. As of February 2018, the books have sold more than 500 million copies worldwide, making them the best-selling book series in history, and have been translated into eighty languages. The last four books consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books in history, with the final instalment selling roughly eleven million copies in the United States within twenty-four hours of its release.\nThe series was originally published in English by two major publishers, Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom and Scholastic Press in the United States. A play, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, based on a story co-written by Rowling, premiered in London on 30 July 2016 at the Palace Theatre, and its script was published by Little, Brown. The original seven books were adapted into an eight-part namesake film series by Warner Bros. Pictures, which is the third highest-grossing film series of all time as of February 2020. In 2016, the total value of the Harry Potter franchise was estimated at $25 billion, making Harry Potter one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.\nA series of many genres, including fantasy, drama, coming of age, and the British school story (which includes elements of mystery, thriller, adventure, horror, and romance), the world of Harry Potter explores numerous themes and includes many cultural meanings and references. According to Rowling, the main theme is death. Other major themes in the series include prejudice, corruption, and madness.The success of the books and films has allowed the Harry Potter franchise to expand with numerous derivative works, a travelling exhibition that premiered in Chicago in 2009, a studio tour in London that opened in 2012, a digital platform on which J.K. Rowling updates the series with new information and insight, and a pentalogy of spin-off films premiering in November 2016 with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, among many other developments.

"3.305","Hate crime","","A hate crime (also known as a bias-motivated crime or bias crime) is a prejudice-motivated crime which occurs when a perpetrator targets a victim because of their membership (or perceived membership) of a certain social group or race.\nExamples of such groups can include, and are almost exclusively limited to: sex, ethnicity, disability, language, nationality, physical appearance, religion, gender identity or sexual orientation. Non-criminal actions that are motivated by these reasons are often called ""bias incidents"".\n""Hate crime"" generally refers to criminal acts which are seen to have been motivated by bias against one or more of the social groups listed above, or by bias against their derivatives. Incidents may involve physical assault, damage to property, bullying, harassment, verbal abuse or insults, mate crime or offensive graffiti or letters (hate mail).A hate crime law is a law intended to deter bias-motivated violence. Hate crime laws are distinct from laws against hate speech: hate crime laws enhance the penalties associated with conduct which is already criminal under other laws, while hate speech laws criminalize a category of speech. Hate speech laws exist in many countries. In the United States, hate speech laws have been upheld by both the Supreme Court and lower courts, especially in the case of 'fighting' words and other violent speech, but are thought by some to be in conflict with the First Amendment right to freedom of speech. Hate crimes are only regulated through threats of injury or death.","wikipedia","['5.5','5.10']"
"3.306","Hate group","","A hate group is a social group that advocates and practices hatred, hostility, or violence towards members of a race, ethnicity, nation, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation or any other designated sector of society. According to the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), a hate group's ""primary purpose is to promote animosity, hostility, and malice against persons belonging to a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or ethnicity/national origin which differs from that of the members of the organization.""\n\n","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.296","HD DVD","","HD DVD (short for High Definition Digital Versatile Disc) is an obsolete high-density optical disc format for storing data and playback of high-definition video. Supported principally by Toshiba, HD DVD was envisioned to be the successor to the standard DVD format.\nOn February 19, 2008, after a protracted format war with rival Blu-ray, Toshiba abandoned the format, announcing it would no longer manufacture HD DVD players and drives. The HD DVD Promotion Group was dissolved on March 28, 2008.The HD DVD physical disc specifications (but not the codecs) were used as the basis for the China Blue High-definition Disc (CBHD) formerly called CH-DVD.\nBecause all variants except 3\u00d7 DVD and HD REC employed a blue laser with a shorter wavelength, HD DVD stored about 3.2 times as much data per layer as its predecessor (maximum capacity: 15 GB per layer compared to 4.7 GB per layer).","wikipedia","5.4"
"3.308","Health care reform in the United States","","Healthcare reform in the United States has a long history. Reforms have often been proposed but have rarely been accomplished. In 2010, landmark reform was passed through two federal statutes enacted in 2010: the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), signed March 23, 2010, and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (H.R. 4872), which amended the PPACA and became law on March 30, 2010.Future reforms of the American health care system continue to be proposed, with notable proposals including a single-payer system and a reduction in fee-for-service medical care. The PPACA includes a new agency, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMS Innovation Center), which is intended to research reform ideas through pilot projects.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.307","Health Services Union expenses affair","","The Health Services Union expenses affair was an Australian political scandal that concerned criminal activities associated with the financial affairs of the Health Services Union of Australia (HSU), between 2006 and 2007; and the Health Services Union ""east branch"" (HSUeast) between 2006 and 2011.Following regulatory and administrative investigations, criminal trials and a subsequent appeal, on 15 December 2014 Craig Thomson, a former national secretary of the HSU and a former Labor politician, was found guilty in the Victorian County Court of thirteen charges of theft, and later convicted and fined A$25,000. Other charges of obtaining financial advantage by deception were dismissed on appeal.His conviction followed an appeal against a conviction and sentence in the Melbourne Magistrates Court on 25 March 2014 when Thomson was found guilty of 65 charges of fraud and theft for using Health Services Union funds for personal benefit; and sentenced to twelve months imprisonment, with nine months suspended over two years. Thomson was initially released on bail; and the conviction and sentence subsequently overturned on appeal.In October 2013, Michael Williamson, a former national president of the HSU, a former general secretary of HSUeast, and a former union and Labor right-wing factional power broker, pleaded guilty to two charges of fraud totaling nearly A$1 million from HSUeast, one charge of fabricating invoices and another charge of recruiting others to hinder a police investigation. An earlier independent report commissioned by the union detailed that companies associated with Williamson and his family had allegedly fraudulently received more than $5 million from HSUeast in the period from 2006 to 2011. In the NSW District Court in March 2014, Williamson was sentenced to seven\u2013and\u2013a\u2013half years of imprisonment; with a non\u2013parole period of five years.As of 28 March 2014 civil proceedings against Thomson and Williamson were pending.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.309","Hebephilia","","Hebephilia is the strong, persistent sexual interest by adults in pubescent (early adolescent) children (especially those showing Tanner stages 2 to 3 of development), which is typically ages 11\u201314. It differs from pedophilia (the primary or exclusive sexual interest in prepubescent children), and from ephebophilia (the primary sexual interest in later adolescents, typically ages 15\u201319). While individuals with a sexual preference for adults may have some sexual interest in pubescent-aged individuals, researchers and clinical diagnoses have proposed that hebephilia is characterized by a sexual preference for pubescent rather than adult partners.Hebephilia is approximate in its age range because the onset and completion of puberty vary. On average, girls begin the process of puberty at age 10 or 11 while boys begin at age 11 or 12. Partly because puberty varies, some definitions of chronophilias (sexual preference for a specific physiological appearance related to age) show overlap between pedophilia, hebephilia and ephebophilia. For example, the DSM-5 extends the prepubescent age to 13, the ICD-10 includes early pubertal age in its definition of pedophilia, and some definitions of ephebophilia include age 14.\nProposals for categorizing hebephilia have argued that separating sexual attraction to prepubescent children from sexual attraction to early-to-mid or late pubescents is clinically relevant. According to research by Ray Blanchard et al. (2009), male sex offenders could be separated into groups by victim age preference on the basis of penile plethysmograph response patterns. Based on their results, Blanchard suggested that the DSM-5 could account for these data by subdividing the existing diagnosis of pedophilia into hebephilia and a narrower definition of pedophilia. Blanchard's proposal to add hebephilia to the DSM-5 proved controversial, and was not adopted. It has not been widely accepted as a paraphilia or mental disorder, and there is significant academic debate as to whether it should be classified as either.\n\n","wikipedia","5.7"
"3.310","Heimatvertriebene","","Heimatvertriebene (German: [\u02c8ha\u026ama\u02d0t.f\u0250\u02cct\u0281i\u02d0b\u0259n\u0259] (listen), ""homeland expellees"") are 12\u201416 million German citizens (regardless of ethnicity) and ethnic Germans (regardless of citizenship) who fled or were expelled after World War II from parts of Germany annexed by Poland and the Soviet Union and from other countries (the so-called einheitliches Vertreibungsgebiet, i.e. uniform territory of expulsion), who found refuge in both West and East Germany, and Austria.\nRefugees who had fled voluntarily but were later refused permission to return are often not distinguished from those who were forcibly deported. By the definition of the West German Federal Expellee Law, enacted on 19 May 1953, refugees of German citizenship or German ethnicity, whose return to their home places was denied, were treated like expellees, thus the frequent general usage of the term expellees for refugees alike.  \nDistinguished are refugees and expellees who had neither German citizenship nor German ethnicity but as a matter of fact had fled or been expelled from their former domiciles and stranded in West Germany or West Berlin before 1951. They were taken care of \u2013 as part of the displaced persons \u2013 by international refugee organisations until 1951 and then by West German authorities granting them the extra status of heimatloser Ausl\u00e4nder with preferential naturalisation rules, distinct from other legal aliens or stateless people. Occupational functionaries and other German expatriates, who had moved to German-annexed or German-occupied foreign territory only due to the war were not considered expellees by law unless they showed circumstances (such as marrying a resident of the respective area) providing for the intention to settle abroad also for the time after the war. Besides the narrow legal definition for the Heimatvertriebene, there were also other groups accepted as Vertriebene (expellees) such as the Aussiedler. These comprised refugees and emigrants either originally of foreign citizenship but of German ethnicity, or who themselves or whose ancestors had involuntarily lost German citizenship, coming from the above-mentioned uniform territory of expulsion or from Albania, Bulgaria, China, Romania, the Soviet Union, or Yugoslavia, and arriving only after the end of general expulsions but not later as 31 December 1992.In a document signed in 1950 the Heimatvertriebene organisations recognised the plight of the different groups of people living in today's Poland who were resettled there by force. The Heimatvertriebene are just one (but by far the largest) of the groups of millions of other people, from many different countries, who all found refuge in today's Germany.\nSome of the expellees are active in politics and belong to the political right wing. Many others do not belong to any organizations, but they continue to maintain what they call a lawful right to their homeland.  The vast majority pledged to work peacefully towards that goal while rebuilding post-war Germany and Europe.\nThe expellees are still highly active in German politics, and are one of the major social groups of the nation, with around 2 million members. The president of the Federation of Expellees is as of 2004 a member of the Bundestag.\nAlthough expellees and their descendants were active in West German politics, the prevailing political climate within West Germany was that of atonement for Nazi actions. However the CDU governments have shown considerable support for the expellees and German civilian victims.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.311","Hentai","","Outside of Japan, hentai (\u5909\u614b or \u3078\u3093\u305f\u3044; listen  English: ; lit. ""pervert"") is anime and manga pornography. In the Japanese language, however, ""hentai"" is not a genre of media but any type of perverse or bizarre sexual desire or act. For example, outside of Japan a work of animation depicting lesbian sex might be described as ""yuri hentai"", but in Japan it would just be described as ""yuri"".\nThe word is short for hentai seiyoku (\u5909\u614b\u6027\u6b32), a perverse sexual desire. The original meaning of hentai in the Japanese language is a transformation or metamorphosis. The implication of perversion or paraphilia was derived from there. Both meanings can be distinguished in context easily.","wikipedia","5.7"
"3.312","Heredity","","Heredity, also called inheritance or biological inheritance, is the passing on of traits from parents to their offspring; either through asexual reproduction or sexual reproduction, the offspring cells or organisms acquire the genetic information of their parents. Through heredity, variations between individuals can accumulate and cause species to evolve by natural selection. The study of heredity in biology is genetics.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.313","Heritability of IQ","","Research on heritability of IQ implies, from the similarity of IQ in closely related persons, the proportion of variance of IQ among individuals in a population that is associated with genetic variation within that population. This provides an estimate of genetic versus environmental influence for phenotypic variation in IQ in that population as environmental factors may be correlated with genetic factors. ""Heritability"", in this sense, ""refers to the genetic contribution to variance within a population and in a specific environment"". In other words, heritability is a mathematical estimate that indicates an upper bound on how much of a trait's variation within that population can be attributed to genes. There has been significant controversy in the academic community about the heritability of IQ since research on the issue began in the late nineteenth century. Intelligence in the normal range is a polygenic trait, meaning that it is influenced by more than one gene, specifically over 500 genes.Twin studies of adult individuals have found a heritability of IQ between 57% and 73% with the most recent studies showing heritability for IQ as high as 80% and 86%.. IQ goes from being weakly correlated with genetics, for children, to being strongly correlated with genetics for late teens and adults. The heritability of IQ increases with age and reaches an asymptote at 18\u201320 years of age and continues at that level well into adulthood. This phenomenon is known as the Wilson Effect. Recent studies suggest that family and parenting characteristics are not significant contributors to variation in IQ scores; however, poor prenatal environment, malnutrition and disease can have deleterious effects.\n\n","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.314","Hezbollah","","Hezbollah (; Arabic: \u062d\u0632\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\u200e \u1e24izbu 'll\u0101h, literally ""Party of Allah"" or ""Party of God"")\u2014also transliterated Hizbullah, Hizballah, etc.\u2014is a Shia Islamist political party and militant group based in Lebanon. Hezbollah's paramilitary wing is the Jihad Council, and its political wing is the Loyalty to the Resistance Bloc party in the Lebanese parliament. Since the death of Abbas al-Musawi in 1992, the group has been headed by Hassan Nasrallah, its Secretary-General. The group, along with its military wing, is considered a terrorist organization by the United States, Israel, Canada, the Arab League, the Gulf Cooperation Council, Argentina, Paraguay, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Australia, Venezuela (Guaid\u00f3 government) Honduras and Colombia. Germany and the European Union outlawed only Hezbollah's military wing, and work with Hezbollah's political wing and allow it to raise funds in Europe.Hezbollah was founded in the early 1980s as part of an Iranian effort to aggregate a variety of militant Lebanese Shia groups into a unified organization. Hezbollah acts as a proxy for Iran in the ongoing Iran\u2013Israel proxy conflict. Hezbollah was conceived by Muslim clerics and funded by Iran primarily to harass Israel. Its leaders were followers of Ayatollah Khomeini and its forces were trained and organized by a contingent of 1,500 Revolutionary Guards that arrived from Iran with permission from the Syrian government, which was in occupation of Lebanon at the time.  Hezbollah's 1985 manifesto listed its objectives as the expulsion of ""the Americans, the French and their allies definitely from Lebanon, putting an end to any colonialist entity on our land"", submission of the Christian Phalangists to ""just power"" and bringing them to justice ""for the crimes they have perpetrated against Muslims and Christians"", and permitting ""all the sons of our people"" to choose the form of government they want, while calling on them to ""pick the option of Islamic government"".Hezbollah waged a guerilla campaign in South Lebanon and, as a result, Israel withdrew from Lebanon on 24 May 2000 and the SLA collapsed and surrendered. Hezbollah organised volunteers who fought on the Bosnian side during the Bosnian War. Hezbollah's military strength has grown so significantly that its paramilitary wing is considered more powerful than the Lebanese Army. Hezbollah has been described as a ""state within a state"", and has grown into an organization with seats in the Lebanese government, a radio and a satellite TV station, social services and large-scale military deployment of fighters beyond Lebanon's borders. Hezbollah is part of the March 8 Alliance within Lebanon, in opposition to the March 14 Alliance. Hezbollah maintains strong support among Lebanon's Shi'a population, while Sunnis have disagreed with the group's agenda. Hezbollah also finds support from within some Christian areas of Lebanon that are Hezbollah strongholds. Hezbollah receives military training, weapons, and financial support from Iran, and political support from Syria. Hezbollah and Israel fought each other in the 2006 Lebanon War.\nAfter the 2006\u201308 Lebanese protests and clashes, a national unity government was formed in 2008, with Hezbollah and its opposition allies' obtaining eleven of thirty cabinets seats, enough to give them veto power. In August 2008, Lebanon's new Cabinet unanimously approved a draft policy statement which recognized Hezbollah's existence as an armed organization and guarantees its right to ""liberate or recover occupied lands"" (such as the Shebaa Farms). Since 2012, Hezbollah has helped the Syrian government during the Syrian civil war in its fight against the Syrian opposition, which Hezbollah has described as a Zionist plot and a ""Wahhabi-Zionist conspiracy"" to destroy its alliance with Assad against Israel. It has deployed its militia in both Syria and Iraq to fight or train local forces to fight against ISIL. The group's legitimacy has been severely damaged due to the sectarian nature of the Syrian Civil War in which it has become embroiled.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.315","High Fructose Corn Syrup","","High-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), also known as glucose-fructose, isoglucose and glucose-fructose syrup, is a sweetener made from corn starch.  As in the production of conventional corn syrup, the starch is broken down into glucose by enzymes.  To make HFCS, the corn syrup is further processed by glucose isomerase to convert some of its glucose into fructose. HFCS was first marketed in the early 1970s by the Clinton Corn Processing Company, together with the Japanese Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, where the enzyme was discovered in 1965.As a sweetener, HFCS is often compared to granulated sugar, but manufacturing advantages of HFCS over sugar include that it is easier to handle and more cost-effective. ""HFCS 42"" refers to 42% and ""HFCS 55"" to 55% fructose composition in manufacturing, respectively. HFCS 42 is mainly used for processed foods and breakfast cereals, whereas HFCS 55 is used mostly for production of soft drinks.The United States Food and Drug Administration states that HFCS is a safe ingredient for food and beverage manufacturing. Uses and exports of HFCS from American producers have grown steadily during the early 21st century.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.316","Hip hop culture","","Hip hop or hip-hop, is a culture and art movement that was created by African Americans, Latino Americans and Caribbean Americans in the Bronx, New York City. The origin of the name is often disputed. It is also argued as to whether hip hop started in the South or West Bronx. While the term hip hop is often used to refer exclusively to hip hop music (including rap), hip hop is characterized by nine elements, of which only four are considered essential to understanding hip hop musically. Afrika Bambaataa of the hip hop collective Zulu Nation outlined these main pillars of hip hop culture, coining the terms: ""rapping"" (also called MCing or emceeing), a rhythmic vocal rhyming style (orality); DJing (and turntablism), which is making music with record players and DJ mixers (aural/sound and music creation); b-boying/b-girling/breakdancing (movement/dance); and graffiti. Other elements of hip hop subculture and arts movements beyond the main four are: hip hop culture and historical knowledge of the movement (intellectual/philosophical); beatboxing, a percussive vocal style; street entrepreneurship; hip hop language; and hip hop fashion and style, among others. The fifth element, although debated, is commonly considered either street knowledge, hip hop fashion, or beatboxing.The Bronx hip hop scene emerged in the mid-1970s from neighborhood block parties thrown by the Black Spades, an African-American group that has been described as being a gang, a club, and a music group. Brother-sister duo Clive Campbell, a.k.a. DJ Kool Herc, and Cindy Campbell additionally hosted DJ parties in the Bronx and are credited for the rise in the genre. Hip hop culture has spread to both urban and suburban communities throughout the United States and subsequently the world. These elements were adapted and developed considerably, particularly as the art forms spread to new continents and merged with local styles in the 1990s and subsequent decades. Even as the movement continues to expand globally and explore myriad styles and art forms, including hip hop theater and hip hop film, the four foundational elements provide coherence and a strong foundation for hip hop culture. Hip hop is simultaneously a new and old phenomenon; the importance of sampling tracks, beats, and basslines from old records to the art form means that much of the culture has revolved around the idea of updating classic recordings, attitudes, and experiences for modern audiences. Sampling older culture and reusing it in a new context or a new format is called ""flipping"" in hip hop culture. Hip hop music follows in the footsteps of earlier African-American-rooted and Latino musical genres such as blues, jazz, rag-time, funk, salsa, and disco to become one of the most practiced genres worldwide.\nIn 1990, Ronald ""Bee-Stinger"" Savage, a former member of the Zulu Nation, is credited for coining the term ""Six elements of the Hip Hop Movement,"" inspired by Public Enemy's recordings. The ""Six Elements Of The Hip Hop Movement"" are: Consciousness Awareness, Civil Rights Awareness, Activism Awareness, Justice, Political Awareness, and Community Awareness in music. Ronald Savage is known as the Son of The Hip Hop Movement.In the 2000s, with the rise of new media platforms and Web 2.0, fans discovered and downloaded or streamed hip hop music through social networking sites beginning with Myspace, as well as from websites like YouTube, Worldstarhiphop, SoundCloud, and Spotify.","wikipedia","5.12"
"3.317","Hippie","","A hippie (sometimes spelled hippy) is a member of the counterculture of the 1960s, originally a youth movement that began in the United States during the mid-1960s and spread to other countries around the world. The word hippie came from hipster and was used to describe beatniks who moved into New York City's Greenwich Village and San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury district. The term hippie first found popularity in San Francisco with Herb Caen, who was a journalist for the San Francisco Chronicle.\nThe origins of the terms hip and hep are uncertain.  By the 1940s, both had become part of African American jive slang and meant ""sophisticated; currently fashionable; fully up-to-date"". The Beats adopted the term hip, and early hippies inherited the language and countercultural values of the Beat Generation. Hippies created their own communities, listened to psychedelic music, embraced the sexual revolution, and many used drugs such as marijuana and LSD to explore altered states of consciousness.\n\nIn 1967, the Human Be-In in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, and Monterey Pop Festival\npopularized hippie culture, leading to the Summer of Love on the West Coast of the United States, and the 1969 Woodstock Festival on the East Coast. Hippies in Mexico, known as jipitecas, formed La Onda and gathered at Av\u00e1ndaro, while in New Zealand, nomadic housetruckers practiced alternative lifestyles and promoted sustainable energy at Nambassa. In the United Kingdom in 1970, many gathered at the gigantic Isle of Wight Festival with a crowd of around 400,000 people. In later years, mobile ""peace convoys"" of New Age travelers made summer pilgrimages to free music festivals at Stonehenge and elsewhere. In Australia, hippies gathered at Nimbin for the 1973 Aquarius Festival and the annual Cannabis Law Reform Rally or MardiGrass. ""Piedra Roja Festival"", a major hippie event in Chile, was held in 1970. Hippie and psychedelic culture influenced 1960s and early 1970s young culture in Iron Curtain countries in Eastern Europe (see M\u00e1ni\u010dka).Hippie fashion and values had a major effect on culture, influencing popular music, television, film, literature, and the arts. Since the 1960s, mainstream society has assimilated many aspects of hippie culture. The religious and cultural diversity the hippies espoused has gained widespread acceptance, and their pop versions of Eastern philosophy and Asian spiritual concepts have reached a larger audience.","wikipedia","5.13"
"3.318","Hispanics","","The term Hispanic (Spanish: hispano or hisp\u00e1nico) refers to persons, cultures, or countries related to the Spanish language, Spanish culture, Spanish people, or to Spain in general. It commonly applies to the people of countries once under colonial possession by the Spanish Empire following Spanish colonization of the Americas, parts of the Asia-Pacific region and Africa. Principally, what are today the countries of Hispanic America, the Spanish Philippines, Spanish Guinea and Spanish Sahara where Spanish may or may not be the predominant or official language and their cultures are heavily derived from Spain although with strong local indigenous or other foreign influences.\nThe term is more broadly used to refer to the culture, peoples, or nations with a historical link to Spain, especially those countries which were once colonized by Spain, particularly the countries of Latin America which were colonized by Spain. The Hispanic culture is a set of customs, traditions, beliefs and art forms (music, literature, dress, architecture, cuisine or others) which are generally shared by peoples in Hispanic regions, but which can vary considerably from one country or territory to another. The Spanish and Portuguese cultures are the main cultural element shared by Hispanic peoples.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.319","Historicity of Jesus","","The historicity of Jesus relates to whether Jesus of Nazareth was a historical figure. Virtually all scholars who have investigated the history of the Christian movement find that the historicity of Jesus is effectively certain, and standard historical criteria have aided in reconstructing his life. However, scholars differ on the beliefs and teachings of Jesus as well as the accuracy of the details of his life that have been described in the gospels. Despite this, very few scholars have argued for non-historicity and have not succeeded due to abundance of evidence to the contrary.The question of the historicity of Jesus is part of the study of the historical Jesus as undertaken in the quest for the historical Jesus and the scholarly reconstructions of the life of Jesus, based primarily on critical analysis of the gospel texts and applying the standard criteria of critical-historical investigation, and methodologies for analyzing the reliability of primary sources and other historical evidence.While scholars have criticized Jesus scholarship for lack of methodological soundness or consistency, with very few exceptions such critics generally do support the historicity of Jesus and reject the Christ myth theory that Jesus never existed.\n\n","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.320","History of Israel","","The Land of Israel, also known as the Holy Land or Palestine, is the birthplace of the Jewish people, the place where the final form of the Hebrew Bible is thought to have been compiled, and the birthplace of Judaism and Christianity. It contains sites sacred to Judaism, Samaritanism, Christianity, Islam, Druze and the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith.\nThe region has come under the sway of various empires and, as a result, has hosted a wide variety of ethnicities. However, the land was predominantly Jewish (who are themselves an outgrowth of the earlier Canaanites) from roughly 1,000 years before the Common Era (BCE) until the 3rd century of the Common Era (CE). The adoption of Christianity by the Roman Empire in the 4th century led to a Greco-Roman Christian majority which lasted not just until the 7th century when the area was conquered by the Arab Muslim Empires, but for another full six centuries. It gradually became predominantly Muslim after the end of the Crusader period (1099-1291), during which it was the focal point of conflict between Christianity and Islam. From the 13th century it was mainly Muslim with Arabic as the dominant language and was first part of the Syrian province of the Mamluk Sultanate and after 1516 part of the Ottoman Empire until the British conquest in 1917-18.\nA Jewish national movement, Zionism, emerged in the late-19th century (partially in response to growing antisemitism), as part of which Aliyah (Jewish return from diaspora) increased. During World War I, the British government publicly committed to create a Jewish National Home and was granted a Mandate to rule Palestine by the League of Nations for this purpose. A rival Arab nationalism also claimed rights over the former Ottoman territories and sought to prevent Jewish migration into Palestine, leading to growing Arab\u2013Jewish tensions.  Israeli independence in 1948 was accompanied by an exodus of Arabs from Israel, the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict and a subsequent Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries to Israel. About 43% of the world's Jews live in Israel today, the largest Jewish community in the world.Since about 1970, the United States has become the principal ally of Israel. In 1979, an uneasy Egypt\u2013Israel Peace Treaty was signed, based on the Camp David Accords. In 1993, Israel signed Oslo I Accord with the Palestine Liberation Organization, followed by establishment of the Palestinian National Authority and in 1994 Israel\u2013Jordan peace treaty was signed. Despite efforts to finalize the peace agreement, the conflict continues to play a major role in Israeli and international political, social and economic life.\nThe economy of Israel was initially primarily democratic socialist and the country dominated by social democratic parties until the 1970s. Since then the Israeli economy has gradually moved to capitalism and a free market economy, partially retaining the social welfare system.\n\n","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.321","History of the Jews in the United States","","There have been Jewish communities in the United States since colonial times. Early Jewish communities were primarily Sephardi (Jews of Spanish and Portuguese descent), composed of immigrants from Brazil and merchants who settled in cities. Until the 1830s, the Jewish community of Charleston, South Carolina, was the largest in North America. In the late 1800s and the beginning of the 1900s, many Jewish immigrants left from various nations to enter the U.S. as part of the general rise of immigration movements. For example, many German Jews arrived in the middle of the 19th century, established clothing stores in towns across the country, formed Reform synagogues, and were active in banking in New York. Immigration of Eastern Yiddish-speaking Ashkenazi Jews, in 1880\u20131914, brought a large, poor, traditional element to New York City. They were Orthodox or Conservative in religion. They founded the Zionist movement in the United States, and were active supporters of the Socialist party and labor unions. Economically, they concentrated in the garment industry.\nRefugees arrived from Europe after World War II and, after 1970, from the Soviet Union. Politically, American Jews have been especially active as part of the liberal New Deal coalition of the Democratic Party since the 1930s, although recently there is a conservative Republican element among the Orthodox.  They have displayed high education levels, and high rates of upward social mobility. The Jewish communities in small towns have declined, with the population becoming increasingly concentrated in large metropolitan areas.\nIn the 1940s, Jews comprised 3.7% of the national population. As of 2019, at about 7.1 million, the population is 2% of the national total\u2014and shrinking as a result of low birth rates and Jewish assimilation. The largest Jewish population centers are the metropolitan areas of New York (2.1 million), Los Angeles (617,000), Miami (527,750), Washington, D.C. (297,290), Chicago (294,280) and Philadelphia (292,450).\n\n","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.297","HIV","","The human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) are two species of Lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that infect humans. Over time they cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), a condition in which progressive failure of the immune system allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive. Without treatment, average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11 years, depending on the HIV subtype. In most cases, HIV is a sexually transmitted infection and occurs by contact with or transfer of blood, pre-ejaculate, semen, and vaginal fluids. Research has shown (for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples) that HIV is untransmissable through condomless sexual intercourse if the HIV-positive partner has a consistently undetectable viral load. Non-sexual transmission can occur from an infected mother to her infant during pregnancy, during childbirth by exposure to her blood or vaginal fluid, and through breast milk. Within these bodily fluids, HIV is present as both free virus particles and virus within infected immune cells.\nHIV infects vital cells in the human immune system, such as helper T cells (specifically CD4+ T cells), macrophages, and dendritic cells. HIV infection leads to low levels of CD4+ T cells through a number of mechanisms, including pyroptosis of abortively infected T cells, apoptosis of uninfected bystander cells, direct viral killing of infected cells, and killing of infected CD4+ T cells by CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes that recognize infected cells. When CD4+ T cell numbers decline below a critical level, cell-mediated immunity is lost, and the body becomes progressively more susceptible to opportunistic infections, leading to the development of AIDS.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.298","HMO","","In the United States, a health maintenance organization (HMO) is a medical insurance group that provides health services for a fixed annual fee. It is an organization that provides or arranges managed care for health insurance, self-funded health care benefit plans, individuals, and other entities, acting as a liaison with health care providers (hospitals, doctors, etc.) on a prepaid basis. The Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973 required employers with 25 or more employees to offer federally certified HMO options if the employer offers traditional healthcare options. Unlike traditional indemnity insurance, an HMO covers care rendered by those doctors and other professionals who have agreed by contract to treat patients in accordance with the HMO's guidelines and restrictions in exchange for a steady stream of customers. HMOs cover emergency care regardless of the health care provider's contracted status.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.322","Hodgkin's Disease","","Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a type of lymphoma in which cancer originates from a specific type of white blood cells called lymphocytes. Symptoms may include fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Often there will be non-painful enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, under the arm, or in the groin. Those affected may feel tired or be itchy.There are two major types of Hodgkin lymphoma: classical Hodgkin lymphoma and nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma. About half of cases of Hodgkin lymphoma are due to Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) and these are generally the classic form. Other risk factors include a family history of the condition and having HIV/AIDS. Diagnosis is by finding Hodgkin cells such as multinucleated Reed\u2013Sternberg cells (RS cells) in lymph nodes. The virus-positive cases are classified as a form of the Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative diseases.Hodgkin lymphoma may be treated with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and stem cell transplant. The choice of treatment often depends on how advanced the cancer has become and whether or not it has favorable features. In early disease, a cure is often possible. The percentage of people who survive five years in the United States is 86%. For those under the age of 20, rates of survival are 97%. Radiation and some chemotherapy drugs, however, increase the risk of other cancers, heart disease, or lung disease over the subsequent decades.In 2015, about 574,000 people globally had Hodgkin lymphoma, and 23,900 (4.2%) died. In the United States, 0.2% of people are affected at some point in their life. The most common age of diagnosis is between 20 and 40 years old. It was named after the English physician Thomas Hodgkin, who first described the condition in 1832.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.323","Holodomor","","The Holodomor (Ukrainian: \u0413\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0301\u0440; \u0413\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0301\u0440 \u0432 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u0301\u043d\u0456; derived from \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0438 \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043c, ""to kill by starvation"") was a man-made famine in Soviet Ukraine in 1932 and 1933 that killed millions of Ukrainians. It is also known as the Terror-Famine and Famine-Genocide in Ukraine, and sometimes referred to as the Great Famine or the Ukrainian Genocide of 1932\u201333. It was part of the wider Soviet famine of 1932\u201333, which affected the major grain-producing areas of the country. During the Holodomor, millions of inhabitants of Ukraine, the majority of whom were ethnic Ukrainians, died of starvation in a peacetime catastrophe unprecedented in the history of Ukraine. Since 2006, the Holodomor has been recognized by Ukraine and 15 other countries as a genocide of the Ukrainian people carried out by the Soviet government.Early estimates of the death toll by scholars and government officials varied greatly. According to higher estimates, up to 12 million ethnic Ukrainians were said to have perished as a result of the famine. A U.N. joint statement signed by 25 countries in 2003 declared that 7\u201310 million perished. Research has since narrowed the estimates to between 3.3 and 7.5 million. According to the findings of the Court of Appeal of Kiev in 2010, the demographic losses due to the famine amounted to 10 million, with 3.9 million direct famine deaths, and a further 6.1 million birth deficits.The term Holodomor emphasises the famine's man-made and intentional aspects, such as rejection of outside aid, confiscation of all household foodstuffs, and restriction of population movement. Whether the Holodomor was genocide is still the subject of academic debate, as are the causes of the famine and intentionality of the deaths. Some scholars believe that the famine was planned by Joseph Stalin to eliminate a Ukrainian independence movement. The loss of life has been compared to that of the Holocaust. However, some historians dispute its characterization as a genocide.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.324","Homeopathy","","Homeopathy or hom\u0153opathy is a pseudoscientific system of alternative medicine. It was created in 1796 by Samuel Hahnemann. Its practitioners, called homeopaths, believe that a substance that causes symptoms of a disease in healthy people would cure similar symptoms in sick people; this doctrine is called similia similibus curentur, or ""like cures like"". Homeopathic preparations are termed remedies and are made using a process called homeopathic dilution. This process involves repeatedly diluting a chosen substance, typically until nothing\u2014that is, not even a single molecule\u2014of the original substance is likely to remain in the product. Between the dilution iterations homeopaths practice hitting and/or violently shaking the diluent, and claim that it makes the diluent remember the original substance after its removal. The diluent is typically either distilled water, ethanol or sugar. Practitioners claim that such preparations, upon oral intake, can treat or cure disease.Despite the claims by the practitioners, homeopathic preparations are not effective for treating any medical condition. All relevant scientific knowledge about physics, chemistry, biochemistry and biology gained since at least the mid-19th century confirms that homeopathic remedies have no active content and no biophysical effect. Hahnemann's theory of disease, centered around principles he termed Miasms, is inconsistent with the germ theory of disease in medicine. Clinical trials have generally demonstrated no objective effect from homeopathic preparations. Its lack of effectiveness has led to it being characterized within the scientific and medical communities as quackery and nonsense.After assessments of homeopathy, national and international bodies have recommended the withdrawal of government funding. Australia, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and France, as well as the European Academies' Science Advisory Council, and the Commission on Pseudoscience and Research Fraud of Russian Academy of Sciences each concluded that homeopathy is ineffective, and recommended against the practice receiving any further funding. Notably, France and England, where homeopathy was formerly prevalent, are in the process of removing all public funding. The National Health Service in England ceased funding homeopathic remedies in November 2017 and asked the Department of Health in the UK to add homeopathic remedies to the blacklist of forbidden prescription items, and France will remove funding by 2021. In November 2018, Spain also announced moves to ban homeopathy and other pseudotherapies.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.325","Homosexuality","","Homosexuality is romantic attraction, sexual attraction, or sexual behavior between members of the same sex or gender.  As a sexual orientation, homosexuality is ""an enduring pattern of emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attractions"" to people of the same sex. It ""also refers to a person's sense of identity based on those attractions, related behaviors, and membership in a community of others who share those attractions.""Along with bisexuality and heterosexuality, homosexuality is one of the three main categories of sexual orientation within the heterosexual\u2013homosexual continuum. Scientists do not know what determines an individual's sexual orientation, but they theorize that it is caused by a complex interplay of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences, and do not view it as a choice. Although no single theory on the cause of sexual orientation has yet gained widespread support, scientists favor biologically-based theories. There is considerably more evidence supporting nonsocial, biological causes of sexual orientation than social ones, especially for males. There is no substantive evidence which suggests parenting or early childhood experiences play a role with regard to sexual orientation. While some people believe that homosexual activity is unnatural, scientific research shows that homosexuality is a normal and natural variation in human sexuality and is not in and of itself a source of negative psychological effects. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of psychological interventions to change sexual orientation.The most common terms for homosexual people are lesbian for females and gay for males, but gay also commonly refers to both homosexual females and males. The percentage of people who are gay or lesbian and the proportion of people who are in same-sex romantic relationships or have had same-sex sexual experiences are difficult for researchers to estimate reliably for a variety of reasons, including many gay and lesbian people not openly identifying as such due to prejudice or discrimination such as homophobia and heterosexism. Homosexual behavior has also been documented in many non-human animal species.Many gay and lesbian people are in committed same-sex relationships, though only in the 2010s have census forms and political conditions facilitated their visibility and enumeration. These relationships are equivalent to heterosexual relationships in essential psychological respects. Homosexual relationships and acts have been admired, as well as condemned, throughout recorded history, depending on the form they took and the culture in which they occurred. Since the end of the 19th century, there has been a global movement towards freedom and equality for gay people, including the introduction of anti-bullying legislation to protect gay children at school, legislation ensuring non-discrimination, equal ability to serve in the military, equal access to health care, equal ability to adopt and parent, and the establishment of marriage equality.","wikipedia","['5.1','5.7']"
"3.326","Human cloning","","Human cloning is the creation is a genetically identical copy (or clone) of a human. The term is generally used to refer to artificial human cloning, which is the reproduction of human cells and tissue. It does not refer to the natural conception and delivery of identical twins. The possibility of person cloning has raised controversies. These ethical concerns have prompted several nations to pass laws regarding human cloning and its legality.\nTwo commonly discussed types of theoretical human cloning are therapeutic cloning and reproductive cloning. Therapeutic cloning would involve cloning cells from a human for use in medicine and transplants, and is an active area of research, but is not in medical practice anywhere in the world, as of October 2019. Two common methods of therapeutic cloning that are being researched are somatic-cell nuclear transfer and, more recently, pluripotent stem cell induction. Reproductive cloning would involve making an entire cloned human, instead of just specific cells or tissues.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.327","Human evolution","","Human evolution is the evolutionary process that led to the emergence of anatomically modern humans, beginning with the evolutionary history of primates\u2014in particular genus Homo\u2014and leading to the emergence of Homo sapiens as a distinct species of the hominid family, the great apes. This process involved the gradual development of traits such as human bipedalism and language, as well as interbreeding with other hominins, which indicate that human evolution was not linear but a web.The study of human evolution involves several scientific disciplines, including physical anthropology, primatology, archaeology, paleontology, neurobiology, ethology, linguistics, evolutionary psychology, embryology and genetics. Genetic studies show that primates diverged from other mammals about 85 million years ago, in the Late Cretaceous period, and the earliest fossils appear in the Paleocene, around 55 million years ago.Within the Hominoidea (apes aka hominoids) superfamily, the Hominidae (great apes aka hominids) family diverged from the Hylobatidae (lesser apes aka gibbons etc.) family some 15\u201320 million years ago; Homininae (African apes) subfamily diverged from Ponginae (orangutans ) about 14 million years ago; the Hominini tribe (including humans, Australopithecines and other extinct biped genera, and chimpanzees) parted from the Gorillini tribe (gorillas) between 8\u20139 million years ago; and, in turn, the subtribes Hominina (hominins, humans and extinct biped ancestors) and Panina (chimpanzees) separated 4\u20137 million years ago.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.328","Huntington's disease","","Huntington's disease (HD), also known as Huntington's chorea, is an inherited disorder that results in the death of brain cells. The earliest symptoms are often subtle problems with mood or mental abilities. A general lack of coordination and an unsteady gait often follow. As the disease advances, uncoordinated, jerky body movements become more apparent. Physical abilities gradually worsen until coordinated movement becomes difficult and the person is unable to talk. Mental abilities generally decline into dementia. The specific symptoms vary somewhat between people. Symptoms usually begin between 30 and 50 years of age but can start at any age. The disease may develop earlier in life in each successive generation. About eight percent of cases start before the age of 20 years and typically present with symptoms more like Parkinson's disease. People with HD often underestimate the degree of their problems.HD is typically inherited, although up to 10% of cases are due to a new mutation. The disease is caused by an autosomal dominant mutation in either of an individual's two copies of a gene called huntingtin. This means a child of an affected person typically has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. The huntingtin gene provides the genetic information for a protein that is also called huntingtin. Expansion of CAG (cytosine-adenine-guanine) triplet repeats in the gene coding for the huntingtin protein results in an abnormal protein, which gradually damages cells in the brain through mechanisms that are not yet fully understood. Diagnosis is by genetic testing, which can be carried out at any time, regardless of whether or not symptoms are present. This fact raises several ethical debates: the age at which an individual is considered mature enough to choose testing; whether parents have the right to have their children tested; and managing confidentiality and disclosure of test results.There is no cure for HD. Full-time care is required in the later stages of the disease. Treatments can relieve some symptoms and, in some, improve quality of life. The best evidence for treatment of the movement problems is with tetrabenazine. HD affects about 4 to 15 in 100,000 people of European descent. It is rare among Japanese, while the occurrence rate in Africa is unknown. The disease affects men and women equally. Complications such as pneumonia, heart disease, and physical injury from falls reduce life expectancy. Suicide is the cause of death in about 9% of cases. Death typically occurs 15\u201320 years from when the disease was first detected.The first likely description of the disease was in 1841 by American physician Charles Oscar Waters. The condition was described in further detail in 1872 by American physician George Huntington. The genetic basis was discovered in 1993 by an international collaborative effort led by the Hereditary Disease Foundation. Research and support organizations began forming in the late 1960s to increase public awareness, provide support for individuals and their families and promote research. Current research directions include determining the exact mechanism of the disease, improving animal models to aid with research, testing of medications to treat symptoms or slow the progression of the disease and studying procedures such as stem cell therapy with the goal of repairing damage caused by the disease.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.329","Hurricane Katrina","","Hurricane Katrina was a Category 5 hurricane that made landfall on Florida and Louisiana in August 2005, causing catastrophic damage, particularly in the city of New Orleans and the surrounding areas, and over 1,200 deaths. Subsequent flooding, caused largely as a result of fatal engineering flaws in the flood protection system known as levees around the city of New Orleans, precipitated most of the loss of lives. The storm was the third major hurricane of the record-breaking 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, and the fourth-most intense Atlantic hurricane on record to make landfall in the contiguous United States, behind only the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Hurricane Camille in 1969, and Hurricane Michael in 2018.\nKatrina originated on August 23, 2005 as a tropical depression from the merger of a tropical wave and the remnants of Tropical Depression Ten. Early the following day, the depression intensified into a tropical storm as it headed generally westward toward Florida, strengthening into a hurricane two hours before making landfall at Hallandale Beach on August 25. After briefly weakening to tropical storm strength over southern Florida, Katrina emerged into the Gulf of Mexico on August 26 and began to rapidly intensify. The storm strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico before weakening to Category 3 strength at its second landfall on August 29 over southeast Louisiana and Mississippi.\nOver fifty breaches in surge protection levees surrounding the city of New Orleans, Louisiana caused of the majority of the death and destruction during Katrina. Eventually, 80% of the city, as well as large tracts of neighboring parishes, were inundated for weeks. The flooding also destroyed most of New Orleans' transportation and communication facilities, leaving tens of thousands of people who had not evacuated the city prior to landfall stranded with little access to food, shelter or basic necessities. The scale of the disaster in New Orleans provoked massive national and international response efforts; federal, local and private rescue operations evacuated displaced persons out of the city over the following weeks. Multiple investigations in the aftermath of the storm concluded that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which had designed and built the region's levees decades earlier, was responsible for the failure of the flood-control systems, though federal courts later ruled that the Corps could not be held financially liable because of sovereign immunity in the Flood Control Act of 1928.The emergency response from federal, state and local governments was widely criticized, resulting in the resignations of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) director Michael D. Brown and New Orleans Police Department (NOPD) Superintendent Eddie Compass. Many other government officials were criticized for their responses, especially New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin, Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco, and President George W. Bush, while several agencies, including the United States Coast Guard (USCG), National Hurricane Center (NHC), and National Weather Service (NWS), were commended for their actions. The NHC especially lauded for providing accurate forecasts well in advance.","wikipedia","5.9"
"3.330","Hydraulic fracturing","","Hydraulic fracturing (also called fracking, fracing, hydrofracking, fraccing, frac'ing, and hydrofracturing) is a well stimulation technique in which rock is fractured by a pressurized liquid. The process involves the high-pressure injection of 'fracking fluid' (primarily water, containing sand or other proppants suspended with the aid of thickening agents) into a wellbore to create cracks in the deep-rock formations through which natural gas, petroleum, and brine will flow more freely. When the hydraulic pressure is removed from the well, small grains of hydraulic fracturing proppants (either sand or aluminium oxide) hold the fractures open.Hydraulic fracturing began as an experiment in 1947, and the first commercially successful application followed in 1950. As of 2012, 2.5 million ""frac jobs"" had been performed worldwide on oil and gas wells; over one million of those within the U.S. Such treatment is generally necessary to achieve adequate flow rates in shale gas, tight gas, tight oil, and coal seam gas wells. Some hydraulic fractures can form naturally in certain veins or dikes.Drilling and hydraulic fracturing have made the United States a major crude oil exporter as of 2019, while helping reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Improvements in the national economy and better prices for consumers have been a result of the decade-long fracking boom.Hydraulic fracturing is highly controversial. Its proponents advocate the economic benefits of more extensively accessible hydrocarbons, as well as replacing coal with natural gas, which burns cleaner and emits half as much carbon dioxide (CO2). Opponents of fracking argue that these are outweighed by the potential environmental impacts, which include risks of ground water and surface water contamination, noise and air pollution, and the triggering of earthquakes, along with the resulting hazards to public health and the environment. Research has determined that human health is affected, including confirmation of chemical, physical, and psychosocial haz\u00adards such as pregnancy and birth outcomes, migraine headaches, chronic rhinosinusitis, severe fatigue, asthma exacerbations, and psychological stress. Groundwater contamination has been documented. Adherence to regulation and safety procedures is required to avoid further negative impacts.Methane leakage is also a problem directly associated with hydraulic fracturing, as an Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) report in the US highlights, where the leakage rate in Pennsylvania during extensive testing and analysis was found to be approximately 10%, or over five times the reported figures. This leakage rate is considered representative of the hydraulic fracturing industry in the US generally. The EDF have recently announced a satellite mission to further locate and measure methane emissions.Increases in seismic activity following hydraulic fracturing along dormant or previously unknown faults are sometimes caused by the deep-injection disposal of hydraulic fracturing flowback (a byproduct of hydraulically fractured wells), and produced formation brine (a byproduct of both fractured and nonfractured oil and gas wells). For these reasons, hydraulic fracturing is under international scrutiny, restricted in some countries, and banned altogether in others. The European Union is drafting regulations that would permit the controlled application of hydraulic fracturing.","wikipedia","5.9"
"3.331","Hydraulic fracturing by country","","Hydraulic fracturing has become a contentious environmental and health issue with Tunisia and France banning the practice and a de facto moratorium in place in Quebec (Canada), and some of the states of the US.","wikipedia","5.9"
"3.332","Hydraulic fracturing in the United States","","Hydraulic fracturing in the United States began in 1949.  According to the Department of Energy (DOE), by 2013 at least two million oil and gas wells in the US had been hydraulically fractured, and that of new wells being drilled, up to 95% are hydraulically fractured. The output from these wells makes up 43% of the oil production and 67% of the natural gas production in the United States. Environmental safety and health concerns about hydraulic fracturing emerged in the 1980s, and are still being debated at the state and federal levels.New York banned massive hydraulic fracturing by executive order in 2012. Vermont, which has no known frackable gas reserves, banned fracking preventatively in May 2012. In March 2017, Maryland became the first state in the US with proven gas reserves to pass a law banning fracking. On May 8, 2019 Washington became the fourth state to ban fracking when Governor Jay Inslee signed SB 5145 into law after it passed the State Senate by a vote of 29-18 and the House 61-37. Washington is a non-oil and gas state that had no fracking operations when the bill was passed.An imbalance in the supply-demand dynamics for the oil and gas produced by hydraulic fracturing in the Permian Basin of west Texas is an increasing challenge for the local industry, as well as a growing impact to the environment.  In 2018,  so much excess natural gas was produced with oil that prices turned negative and wasteful flaring increased to a record 400 million cubic feet per day.   By Q3 of 2019, the wasted gas from this region alone almost doubled to 750 million cubic feet per day, an amount more than capable of supplying the entire residential needs of the state.","wikipedia","5.9"
"3.333","Hydrogen Bomb","","A thermonuclear weapon, fusion weapon or hydrogen bomb (H bomb), is a second-generation nuclear weapon design. Its greater sophistication affords it vastly greater destructive power than first-generation atomic bombs, a more compact size, a lower mass or a combination of these benefits. Characteristics of nuclear fusion reactions make possible the use of non-fissile depleted uranium as the weapon's main fuel, thus allowing more efficient use of scarce fissile material such as uranium-235 (U-235) or plutonium-239 (Pu-239).\nModern fusion weapons consist essentially of two main components: a nuclear fission primary stage (fueled by U-235 or Pu-239) and a separate nuclear fusion secondary stage containing thermonuclear fuel: the heavy hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium, or in modern weapons lithium deuteride. For this reason, thermonuclear weapons are often colloquially called hydrogen bombs or H-bombs.A fusion explosion begins with the detonation of the fission primary stage. Its temperature soars past approximately one hundred million kelvins, causing it to glow intensely with thermal X-radiation. These X-rays flood the void (the ""radiation channel"" often filled with polystyrene foam) between the primary and secondary assemblies placed within an enclosure called a radiation case, which confines the X-ray energy and resists its outward pressure. The distance separating the two assemblies ensures that debris fragments from the fission primary (which move much slower than X-ray photons) cannot disassemble the secondary before the fusion explosion runs to completion.\nThe secondary fusion stage\u2014consisting of outer pusher/tamper, fusion fuel filler and central plutonium spark plug\u2014is imploded by the X-ray energy impinging on its pusher/tamper. This compresses the entire secondary stage and drives up the density of the plutonium spark plug. The density of the plutonium fuel rises to such an extent that the spark plug is driven into a supercritical state, and it begins a nuclear fission chain reaction. The fission products of this chain reaction heat the highly compressed, and thus superdense, thermonuclear fuel surrounding the spark plug to around 300 million Kelvins, igniting fusion reactions between fusion fuel nuclei. In modern weapons fueled by lithium deuteride, the fissioning plutonium spark plug also emits free neutrons which collide with lithium nuclei and supply the tritium component of the thermonuclear fuel.\nThe secondary's relatively massive tamper (which resists outward expansion as the explosion proceeds) also serves as a thermal barrier to keep the fusion fuel filler from becoming too hot, which would spoil the compression. If made of uranium, enriched uranium or plutonium, the tamper captures fast fusion neutrons and undergoes fission itself, increasing the overall explosive yield. Additionally, in most designs the radiation case is also constructed of a fissile material that undergoes fission driven by fast thermonuclear neutrons. Such bombs are classified as three stage weapons, and most current Teller\u2013Ulam designs are such fission-fusion-fission weapons. Fast fission of the tamper and radiation case is the main contribution to the total yield and is the dominant process that produces radioactive fission product fallout.The first full-scale thermonuclear test was carried out by the United States in 1952; the concept has since been employed by most of the world's nuclear powers in the design of their weapons. The design of all modern thermonuclear weapons in the United States is known as the Teller\u2013Ulam configuration for its two chief contributors, Edward Teller and Stanislaw Ulam, who developed it in 1951 for the United States, with certain concepts developed with the contribution of physicist John von Neumann. Similar devices were developed by the Soviet Union, United Kingdom, France, and China. \nAs thermonuclear weapons represent the most efficient design for weapon energy yield in weapons with yields above 50 kilotons of TNT (210 TJ), virtually all the nuclear weapons of this size deployed by the five nuclear-weapon states under the Non-Proliferation Treaty today are thermonuclear weapons using the Teller\u2013Ulam design.","wikipedia","5.9"

It was founded in 1914 by Felix Y. Manalo.\nINC describes itself to be the one true church and the restoration of the original church founded by Jesus, and that all other Christian churches are apostates. INC doctrine cites that the official registration of the church with the government of the Philippines on July 27, 1914, by Felix Y. Manalo\u2014upheld by its members to be the last messenger of God\u2014was an act of divine providence and the fulfillment of biblical prophecy concerning the re-establishment of the original church of Christ in the Far East concurrent with the coming of the seventh seal marking the end of days.By the time of Manalo's death in 1963, INC had become a nationwide church with 1,250 local chapels and 35 large concrete cathedrals. His son, Era\u00f1o G. Manalo, became the next church leader and led a campaign to grow and internationalize the church until his death on August 31, 2009, whereupon his son, Eduardo V. Manalo, succeeded him as Executive Minister. In 2015, the Philippine census by the Philippine Statistics Authority found that 2.64% of the population in the Philippines are affiliated with the Iglesia Ni Cristo, making it the religion with the third largest number of adherents, with Islam at 6.01% and Catholicism at 79.53%.","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.336","Illegal drugs","","The prohibition of drugs through sumptuary legislation or religious law is a common means of attempting to prevent the recreational use of certain intoxicating substances.\nWhile some drugs are illegal to possess, many governments regulate the manufacture, distribution, marketing, sale and use of certain drugs, for instance through a prescription system. For example, amphetamines may be legal to possess if a doctor has prescribed them; otherwise, possession or sale of the drug is typically a criminal offence.  Only certain drugs are banned with a ""blanket prohibition"" against all possession or use (e.g., LSD, a psychedelic that was once used medicinally). The most widely banned substances include psychoactive drugs, although blanket prohibition also extends to some steroids and other drugs. Many governments do not criminalize the possession of a limited quantity of certain drugs for personal use, while still prohibiting their sale or manufacture, or possession in large quantities. Some laws set a specific volume of a particular drug, above which is considered ipso jure to be evidence of trafficking or sale of the drug.Drug prohibition is responsible for enriching ""organised criminal networks"", according to some critics, and the hypothesis that the prohibition of drugs generates violence is consistent with research done over long time-series and cross-country facts.Some Islamic countries prohibit the use of alcohol (see list of countries with alcohol prohibition). Many governments levy a sin tax on alcohol and tobacco products, and restrict alcohol and tobacco from being sold or gifted to a minor. Other common restrictions include bans on outdoor drinking and indoor smoking. In the early 20th century, many countries had alcohol prohibition. These include the United States (1920\u20131933), Finland (1919\u20131932), Norway (1916\u20131927), Canada (1901\u20131948), Iceland (1915\u20131922) and the Russian Empire/USSR (1914\u20131925).","wikipedia","5.0"

The latest edition is the eighth, which was published in June 2017. Warhammer 40,000 is the most popular miniature wargame in the world. It is most popular in Britain.As in other miniature wargames, players enact a battle using miniature models of warriors and fighting vehicles. The playing area is a tabletop model of a battlefield, comprising models of buildings, hills, trees, and other terrain features. Players take turns to move their model warriors around the battlefield and pretend that they are fighting the other player's warriors. These imaginary fights are resolved using dice and simple arithmetic.\nWarhammer 40,000 is set in the distant future, where a stagnant human civilization is beset by hostile aliens and malevolent supernatural creatures. The models in the game are a mixture of humans, aliens, and supernatural monsters, wielding futuristic weaponry and magical powers. \nWarhammer 40,000 has spawned a number of spin-off tabletop games. These include Battlefleet Gothic, which simulates spaceship combat; and Space Hulk, which simulates combat within the confines of derelict spacecraft. It has also spawned many video games, such as the Dawn of War series. Finally, it has spawned a large body of novels and comic books, which develop the fictional setting in detail.\n\n","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.338","Incest","","Incest  is human sexual activity between family members or close relatives. This typically includes sexual activity between people in consanguinity (blood relations), and sometimes those related by affinity (marriage or stepfamily), adoption, clan, or lineage.\nThe incest taboo is one of the most widespread of all cultural taboos, both in present and in past societies. Most modern societies have laws regarding incest or social restrictions on closely consanguineous marriages. In societies where it is illegal, consensual adult incest is seen by some as a victimless crime. Some cultures extend the incest taboo to relatives with no consanguinity such as milk-siblings, step-siblings, and adoptive siblings, albeit sometimes with less intensity. Third-degree relatives (such as half-aunt, half-nephew, first cousin) on average have 12.5% common genetic heritage, and sexual relations between them are viewed differently in various cultures, from being discouraged to being socially acceptable. Children of incestuous relationships have been regarded as illegitimate, and are still so regarded in some societies today. In most cases, the parents did not have the option to marry to remove that status, as incestuous marriages were, and are, normally also prohibited.\nA common justification for prohibiting incest is avoiding inbreeding: a collection of genetic disorders suffered by the children of parents with a close genetic relationship. Such children are at greater risk for congenital disorders, death, and developmental and physical disability, and that risk is proportional to their parents' coefficient of relationship\u2014a measure of how closely the parents are related genetically. But cultural anthropologists have noted that inbreeding avoidance cannot form the sole basis for the incest taboo because the boundaries of the incest prohibition vary widely between cultures, and not necessarily in ways that maximize the avoidance of inbreeding.In some societies, such as those of Ancient Egypt, brother\u2013sister, father\u2013daughter, mother\u2013son, cousin\u2013cousin, aunt\u2013nephew, uncle\u2013niece, and other combinations of relations within a royal family were married as a means of perpetuating the royal lineage. Some societies, such as the Balinese and some Inuit tribes, have different views about what constitutes illegal or immoral incest. However, sexual relations with a first-degree relative (meaning a parent or sibling) are almost universally forbidden.","wikipedia","5.7"
"3.339","Indent style","","In computer programming, an indentation style is a convention governing the indentation of blocks of code to convey program structure. This article largely addresses the free-form languages, such as C and its descendants, but can be (and often is) applied to most other programming languages (especially those in the curly bracket family), where whitespace is otherwise insignificant. Indentation style is only one aspect of programming style.\nIndentation is not a requirement of most programming languages, where it is used as secondary notation. Rather, indenting helps better convey the structure of a program to human readers. Especially, it is used to clarify the link between control flow constructs such as conditions or loops, and code contained within and outside of them. However, some languages (such as Python and occam) use indentation to determine the structure instead of using braces or keywords; this is termed the off-side rule. In such languages, indentation is meaningful to the compiler or interpreter; it is more than only a clarity or style issue.\nThis article uses ""brackets"" to refer to what are termed parentheses in American English, and ""braces"" to refer to what are termed curly brackets in American English.\n\n","wikipedia","5.4"

"3.341","Influenza","","Influenza, commonly known as ""the flu"", is an infectious disease caused by an influenza virus. Symptoms can be mild to severe. The most common symptoms include: high fever, runny nose, sore throat, muscle and joint pain, headache, coughing, and feeling tired. These symptoms typically begin two days after exposure to the virus and most last less than a week. The cough, however, may last for more than two weeks. In children, there may be diarrhea and vomiting, but these are not common in adults. Diarrhea and vomiting occur more commonly in gastroenteritis, which is an unrelated disease and sometimes inaccurately referred to as ""stomach flu"" or the ""24-hour flu"". Complications of influenza may include viral pneumonia, secondary bacterial pneumonia, sinus infections, and worsening of previous health problems such as asthma or heart failure.Three of the four types of influenza viruses affect humans: Type A, Type B, and Type C. Type D has not been known to infect humans, but is believed to have the potential to do so. Usually, the virus is spread through the air from coughs or sneezes. This is believed to occur mostly over relatively short distances. It can also be spread by touching surfaces contaminated by the virus and then touching the eyes, nose, or mouth. A person may be infectious to others both before and during the time they are showing symptoms. The infection may be confirmed by testing the throat, sputum, or nose for the virus. A number of rapid tests are available; however, people may still have the infection even if the results are negative. A type of polymerase chain reaction that detects the virus's RNA is more accurate.Frequent hand washing reduces the risk of viral spread. Wearing a surgical mask is also useful. Yearly vaccinations against influenza are recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for those at high risk, and by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for those six months of age and older. The vaccine is usually effective against three or four types of influenza. It is usually well tolerated. A vaccine made for one year may not be useful in the following year, since the virus evolves rapidly. Antiviral drugs such as the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir, among others, have been used to treat influenza. The benefit of antiviral drugs in those who are otherwise healthy do not appear to be greater than their risks. No benefit has been found in those with other health problems.Influenza spreads around the world in yearly outbreaks, resulting in about three to five million cases of severe illness and about 290,000 to 650,000 deaths. About 20% of unvaccinated children and 10% of unvaccinated adults are infected each year. In the northern and southern parts of the world, outbreaks occur mainly in the winter, while around the equator, outbreaks may occur at any time of the year. Death occurs mostly in high risk groups\u2014the young, the old, and those with other health problems. Larger outbreaks known as pandemics are less frequent. In the 20th century, three influenza pandemics occurred: Spanish influenza in 1918 (17\u2013100 million deaths), Asian influenza in 1957 (two million deaths), and Hong Kong influenza in 1968 (one million deaths). The World Health Organization declared an outbreak of a new type of influenza A/H1N1 to be a pandemic in June 2009. Influenza may also affect other animals, including pigs, horses, and birds.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.342","Institute for Creation Research","","The Institute for Creation Research (ICR) is a Creationist apologetics institute in Dallas, Texas that specializes in media promotion of pseudoscientific creation science and interpretation of the Genesis creation narrative as a historical event. The ICR adopts the Bible as an inerrant and literal documentary of scientific and historical fact as well as religious and moral truths, and espouses a Young Earth creationist worldview. It rejects evolutionary biology, which it views as a corrupting moral and social influence and threat to religious belief. The ICR was formed by Henry M. Morris in 1972 following an organizational split with the Creation Science Research Center (CSRC).Its work in the field of creation science has been rejected by mainstream science, but has been significant in shaping creationist thought in the United States by introducing creation science through fundamentalist churches and religious schools, and by engaging in public debates against supporters of evolution. The ICR also offers unaccredited graduate level programs in Biblical Apologetics, including a minor in Creation Research. ICR operates the ICR Discovery Center for Science and Earth History, a museum in Dallas, Texas.\n\n","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.343","Insurance","","Insurance is a means of protection from financial loss.  It is a form of risk management, primarily used to hedge against the risk of a contingent or uncertain loss.\nAn entity which provides insurance is known as an insurer, insurance company, insurance carrier or underwriter.  A person or entity who buys insurance is known as an insured or as a policyholder. The insurance transaction involves the insured assuming a guaranteed and known relatively small loss in the form of payment to the insurer in exchange for the insurer's promise to compensate the insured in the event of a covered loss.  The loss may or may not be financial, but it must be reducible to financial terms, and usually involves something in which the insured has an insurable interest established by ownership, possession, or pre-existing relationship.\nThe insured receives a contract, called the insurance policy, which details the conditions and circumstances under which the insurer will compensate the insured. The amount of money charged by the insurer to the policyholder for the coverage set forth in the insurance policy is called the premium. If the insured experiences a loss which is potentially covered by the insurance policy, the insured submits a claim to the insurer for processing by a claims adjuster. The insurer may hedge its own risk by taking out reinsurance, whereby another insurance company agrees to carry some of the risk, especially if the primary insurer deems the risk too large for it to carry.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.344","Intelligent design","","Intelligent design (ID) is a  pseudoscientific argument for the existence of God, presented by its proponents as ""an evidence-based scientific theory about life's origins"". Proponents claim that ""certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as natural selection."" ID is a form of creationism that lacks empirical support and offers no testable or tenable hypotheses, so it is not science. The leading proponents of ID are associated with the Discovery Institute,  a Christian, politically conservative think tank based in the United States.Though the phrase ""intelligent design"" had featured previously in theological discussions of the argument from design, the first publication of the term intelligent design in its present use as an alternative term for creationism was in Of Pandas and People, a 1989 creationist textbook intended for high school biology classes. The term was substituted into drafts of the book, directly replacing references to creation science and creationism, after the 1987 United States Supreme Court's Edwards v. Aguillard decision which barred the teaching of creation science in  public schools on constitutional grounds. From the mid-1990s, the intelligent design movement (IDM), supported by the Discovery Institute, advocated inclusion of intelligent design in public school biology curricula. This led to the 2005 Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District trial in which U.S. District Judge John E. Jones III found that intelligent design was not science, that it ""cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents,"" and that the school district's promotion of it therefore violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.ID presents two main arguments against evolutionary explanations: irreducible complexity and specified complexity. These arguments assert that certain features (biological and informational, respectively) are too complex to be the result of natural processes. As a positive argument against evolution, ID proposes an analogy between natural systems and human artifacts, a version of the theological argument from design for the existence of God. ID proponents then conclude by analogy that the complex features, as defined by ID, are evidence of design.Detailed scientific examination has rebutted the claims that evolutionary explanations are inadequate, and this premise of intelligent design\u2014that evidence against evolution constitutes evidence for design\u2014is a false dichotomy. It is asserted that ID challenges the methodological naturalism inherent in modern science though proponents concede that they have yet to produce a scientific theory.\n\n","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.345","Internet forum","","An Internet forum, or message board, is an online discussion site where people can hold conversations in the form of posted messages. They differ from chat rooms in that messages are often longer than one line of text, and are at least temporarily archived. Also, depending on the access level of a user or the forum set-up, a posted message might need to be approved by a moderator before it becomes publicly visible.\nForums have a specific set of jargon associated with them; example: a single conversation is called a ""thread"", or topic.\nA discussion forum is hierarchical or tree-like in structure: a forum can contain a number of subforums, each of which may have several topics. Within a forum's topic, each new discussion started is called a thread and can be replied to by as many people as so wish.\nDepending on the forum's settings, users can be anonymous or have to register with the forum and then subsequently log in to post messages. On most forums, users do not have to log in to read existing messages.","wikipedia","5.13"
"3.334","IQ and the Wealth of Nations","","IQ and the Wealth of Nations is a 2002 book by psychologist Richard Lynn and  political scientist Tatu Vanhanen. The authors argue that differences in national income (in the form of per capita gross domestic product) are correlated with differences in the average national intelligence quotient (IQ). They further argue that differences in average national IQs constitute one important factor, but not the only one, contributing to differences in national wealth and rates of economic growth.\nThe book has drawn widespread criticism from other academics. Critiques have included questioning of the methodology used, the incompleteness of the data, and the conclusions drawn from the analysis. The 2006 book IQ and Global Inequality is a follow-up to IQ and the Wealth of Nations by the same authors.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.346","Iran hostage crisis","","The Iran hostage crisis was a diplomatic standoff between the United States and Iran. Fifty-two American diplomats and citizens were held hostage for 444 days from November 4, 1979, to January 20, 1981, after a group of Iranian college students belonging to the Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line, who supported the Iranian Revolution, took over the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.Western media described the crisis as an ""entanglement"" of ""vengeance and mutual incomprehension."" American President Jimmy Carter called the hostage-taking an act of ""blackmail"" and the hostages ""victims of terrorism and anarchy."" In Iran it was widely seen as an act against the U.S. and its influence in Iran, including its perceived attempts to undermine the Iranian Revolution and its longstanding support of the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was overthrown in 1979.After Shah Pahlavi was overthrown, he was admitted to the U.S. for cancer treatment. Iran demanded his return in order to stand trial for crimes that he was accused of committing during his reign. Specifically, he was accused of committing crimes against Iranian citizens with the help of his secret police. Iran's demands were rejected by the United States, and Iran saw the decision to grant him asylum as American complicity in those atrocities. The Americans saw the hostage-taking as an egregious violation of the principles of international law, such as the Vienna Convention, which granted diplomats immunity from arrest and made diplomatic compounds inviolable.The Shah left the United States in December 1979 and was ultimately granted asylum in Egypt, where he died from complications of cancer at age 60 on July 27, 1980.\nSix American diplomats who had evaded capture had been rescued by a joint CIA\u2013Canadian effort on January 27, 1980.\nThe crisis reached a climax after diplomatic negotiations failed to win the release of the hostages. Carter ordered the U.S. military to attempt a rescue mission \u2013 Operation Eagle Claw \u2013 using warships that included the USS Nimitz and USS Coral Sea, which were patrolling the waters near Iran. The failed attempt on April 24, 1980 resulted in the death of one Iranian civilian, and the accidental deaths of eight American servicemen after one of the helicopters crashed into a transport aircraft. United States Secretary of State Cyrus Vance resigned his position following the failure. \nIn September 1980 the Iraqi military invaded Iran, beginning the Iran\u2013Iraq War. These events led the Iranian government to enter negotiations with the U.S., with Algeria acting as a mediator. The crisis is considered a pivotal episode in the history of Iran\u2013United States relations.Political analysts cited the standoff as a major factor in the continuing downfall of Carter's presidency and his landslide loss in the 1980 presidential election; the hostages were formally released into United States custody the day after the signing of the Algiers Accords, just minutes after American President Ronald Reagan was sworn into office. In Iran the crisis strengthened the prestige of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and the political power of theocrats who opposed any normalization of relations with the West. The crisis also led to American economic sanctions against Iran, which further weakened ties between the two countries.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.347","Ireland","","Ireland ( (listen); Irish: \u00c9ire [\u02c8e\u02d0\u027e\u02b2\u0259] (listen); Ulster-Scots: Airlann [\u02c8\u0251\u02d0rl\u0259n]) is an island in the North Atlantic. It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel, the Irish Sea, and St George's Channel. Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles, the third-largest in Europe, and the twentieth-largest on Earth.Geopolitically, Ireland is divided between the Republic of Ireland (officially named Ireland), which covers five-sixths of the island, and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom. In 2011, the population of Ireland was about 6.6 million, ranking it the second-most populous island in Europe after Great Britain. As of 2016, 4.8 million live in the Republic of Ireland, and 1.8 million live in Northern Ireland.The geography of Ireland comprises relatively low-lying mountains surrounding a central plain, with several navigable rivers extending inland. Its lush vegetation is a product of its mild but changeable climate which is free of extremes in temperature. Much of Ireland was woodland until the end of the Middle Ages. Today, woodland makes up about 10% of the island, compared with a European average of over 33%, and most of it is non-native conifer plantations. There are twenty-six extant land mammal species native to Ireland. The Irish climate is influenced by the Atlantic Ocean and thus very moderate, and winters are milder than expected for such a northerly area, although summers are cooler than those in continental Europe. Rainfall and cloud cover are abundant.\nThe earliest evidence of human presence in Ireland is dated at 10,500 BC. Gaelic Ireland had emerged by the 1st century AD. The island was Christianised from the 5th century onward. Following the 12th century Norman invasion, England claimed sovereignty. However, English rule did not extend over the whole island until the 16th\u201317th century Tudor conquest, which led to colonisation by settlers from Britain. In the 1690s, a system of Protestant English rule was designed to materially disadvantage the Catholic majority and Protestant dissenters, and was extended during the 18th century. With the Acts of Union in 1801, Ireland became a part of the United Kingdom. A war of independence in the early 20th century was followed by the partition of the island, creating the Irish Free State, which became increasingly sovereign over the following decades, and Northern Ireland, which remained a part of the United Kingdom. Northern Ireland saw much civil unrest from the late 1960s until the 1990s. This subsided following a political agreement in 1998. In 1973 the Republic of Ireland joined the European Economic Community while the United Kingdom, and Northern Ireland, as part of it, did the same.\nIrish culture has had a significant influence on other cultures, especially in the field of literature. Alongside mainstream Western culture, a strong indigenous culture exists, as expressed through Gaelic games, Irish music and the Irish language. The island's culture shares many features with that of Great Britain, including the English language, and sports such as association football, rugby, horse racing, and golf.","wikipedia","['5.5','5.6']"

It is the world's second-largest religion with over 1.8 billion followers or 24.1% of the world's population, commonly known as Muslims. Muslims make up a majority of the population in 49 countries. Islam teaches that God is merciful, all-powerful, and unique, and has guided mankind through prophets, revealed scriptures and natural signs. The primary scriptures of Islam are the Quran, believed to be the verbatim word of God, and the teachings and normative examples (called the sunnah, composed of accounts called hadith) of Muhammad (c. 570 \u2013 8 June 632 CE).Muslims believe that Islam is the complete and universal version of a primordial faith that was revealed many times before through prophets including Adam, Abraham, Moses and Jesus. Muslims consider the Quran in its Arabic to be the unaltered and final revelation of God. Like other Abrahamic religions, Islam also teaches a final judgment with the righteous rewarded in paradise and unrighteous punished in hell. Religious concepts and practices include the Five Pillars of Islam, which are obligatory acts of worship, and following Islamic law (sharia), which touches on virtually every aspect of life and society, from banking and welfare to women and the environment. The cities of Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem are home to the three holiest sites in Islam.Aside from the theological narrative, Islam is historically believed to have originated in the early 7th century CE in Mecca, and by the 8th century the Umayyad Caliphate extended from Iberia in the west to the Indus River in the east. The Islamic Golden Age refers to the period traditionally dated from the 8th century to the 13th century, during the Abbasid Caliphate, when much of the historically Muslim world was experiencing a scientific, economic and cultural flourishing. The expansion of the Muslim world involved various states and dynasties such as the Ottoman Empire, trade and conversion to Islam by missionary activities (dawah).Most Muslims are of one of two denominations; Sunni (75\u201390%) or Shia (10\u201320%). About 13% of Muslims live in Indonesia, the largest Muslim-majority country; 31% live in South Asia, the largest population of Muslims in the world; 20% in the Middle East\u2013North Africa region, where it is the dominant religion; and 15% in Sub-Saharan Africa. Muslims are the majority in Central Asia, and are also widespread in the Caucasus, and Southeast Asia. India is the country with the largest Muslim population outside Muslim-majority countries. Sizeable Muslim communities can also be found in the Americas, China, Europe, and Russia. Islam is the fastest-growing major religion in the world.\n\n","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.350","Islamophobia","","Islamophobia is the fear, hatred of, or prejudice against the Islamic religion or Muslims generally, especially when seen as a geopolitical force or the source of terrorism.The meaning of the term continues to be debated, and some view it as problematic. Several scholars consider Islamophobia to be a form of xenophobia or racism, although the legitimacy of this definition is disputed. Some scholars view Islamophobia and racism as partially overlapping phenomena, while others dispute the relationship, primarily on the grounds that religion is not a race. The causes and characteristics of Islamophobia are also subjects of debate. Some commentators have posited an increase in Islamophobia resulting from the September 11 attacks, the rise of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, and other terror attacks in Europe and the United States by Islamic extremists. Some have associated it with the increased presence of Muslims in the United States and in the European Union, while others view it as a response to the emergence of a global Muslim identity.","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.351","Israeli–Palestinian conflict","","The Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict (Hebrew: \u05d4\u05e1\u05db\u05e1\u05d5\u05da \u05d4\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc\u05d9-\u05e4\u05dc\u05e1\u05d8\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u200e, romanized: Ha'Sikhsukh Ha'Yisraeli-Falestini; Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0632\u0627\u0639-\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0644\u0633\u0637\u064a\u0646\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0626\u064a\u0644\u064a\u200e, romanized: al-Niza'a al-Filastini-al-Israili) is the ongoing struggle between Israelis and Palestinians that began in the mid-20th century. Various attempts have been made to resolve the conflict as part of the Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process, with only partial success, as at the end of 2019.\nThe origins to the conflict can be traced back to Jewish immigration and sectarian conflict in Mandatory Palestine between Jews and Arabs. It has been referred to as the world's ""most intractable conflict,"" with the ongoing Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip reaching 53 years.Despite a long-term peace process and the general reconciliation of Israel with Egypt and Jordan, Israelis and Palestinians have failed to reach a final peace agreement. The key issues are mutual recognition and security, borders, water rights, control of Jerusalem, Israeli settlements, Palestinian freedom of movement, and Palestinian right of return. The violence of the conflict, in a region rich in sites of historic, cultural and religious interest worldwide, has been the subject of numerous international conferences dealing with historic rights, security issues and human rights, and has been a factor hampering tourism in and general access to areas that are hotly contested. Many attempts have been made to broker a two-state solution, involving the creation of an independent Palestinian state alongside the State of Israel (after Israel's establishment in 1948). In 2007, the majority of both Israelis and Palestinians, according to a number of polls, preferred the two-state solution over any other solution as a means of resolving the conflict.Within Israeli and Palestinian society, the conflict generates a wide variety of views and opinions. This highlights the deep divisions which exist not only between Israelis and Palestinians, but also within each society. A hallmark of the conflict has been the level of violence witnessed for virtually its entire duration. Fighting has been conducted by regular armies, paramilitary groups, terror cells, and individuals. Casualties have not been restricted to the military, with a large number of fatalities in civilian population on both sides. There are prominent international actors involved in the conflict. A majority of Jews see the Palestinians' demand for an independent state as just, and thinks Israel can agree to the establishment of such a state. The majority of Palestinians and Israelis in the West Bank and Gaza Strip have expressed a preference for a two-state solution. Mutual distrust and significant disagreements are deep over basic issues, as is the reciprocal skepticism about the other side's commitment to upholding obligations in an eventual agreement.The two parties currently engaged in direct negotiation are the Israeli government, led by Benjamin Netanyahu, and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), headed by Mahmoud Abbas. The official negotiations are mediated by an international contingent known as the Quartet on the Middle East (the Quartet) represented by a special envoy, that consists of the United States, Russia, the European Union, and the United Nations. The Arab League is another important actor, which has proposed an alternative peace plan. Egypt, a founding member of the Arab League, has historically been a key participant. Jordan, having relinquished its claim to the West Bank in 1988 and holding a special role in the Muslim Holy shrines in Jerusalem, has also been a key participant.\nSince 2006, the Palestinian side has been fractured by conflict between two major factions: Fatah, the traditionally dominant party, and its later electoral challenger, Hamas, which also operates as a militant organization. After Hamas's electoral victory in 2006, the Quartet conditioned future foreign assistance to the Palestinian National Authority (PA) on the future government's commitment to non-violence, recognition of the State of Israel, and acceptance of previous agreements. Hamas rejected these demands, which resulted in the Quartet's suspension of its foreign assistance program, and the imposition of economic sanctions by the Israelis. A year later, following Hamas's seizure of the Gaza Strip in June 2007, the territory officially recognized as the PA was split between Fatah in the West Bank and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The division of governance between the parties had effectively resulted in the collapse of bipartisan governance of the PA. However, in 2014, a Palestinian Unity Government, composed of both Fatah and Hamas, was formed. The latest round of peace negotiations began in July 2013 and was suspended in 2014.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.352","Italian American","","Italian Americans (Italian: italoamericani or italo-americani [\u02ccitalo.ameri\u02c8ka\u02d0ni]) are citizens of the United States of America who are of Italian descent. Residing mainly in Northeastern and urban industrial Midwestern metropolitan areas, Italian Americans are the fifth largest self-identified ethnic group in the United States behind German Americans, Irish Americans, English Americans and Mexican Americans, though realistically the various Americans of British, Northwestern European, and Germanic ancestries that do not identify their ancestry in censuses or identify simply as \u201cAmerican\u201d are much higher in number.About 5.5 million Italians immigrated to the United States from 1820 to 2004. In 1870, there were fewer than 25,000 Italian immigrants in America, many of them Northern Italian refugees from the wars that accompanied the Risorgimento\u2014the struggle for Italian unification and independence from foreign rule which ended in 1871. Immigration began to increase during the 1870s, when more than twice as many Italians immigrated (1870\u201379: 46,296) than during the five previous decades combined (1820\u201369: 22,627). The 1870s were followed by the greatest surge of immigration, which occurred between 1880 and 1914 and brought more than 4 million Italians to the United States,  the greatest number coming from Southern Italy (namely Campania, Apulia, Basilicata, Calabria and Sicily), areas which were still largely rural and agricultural, and where much of the populace had been impoverished by centuries of foreign misrule, and an oppressive taxation system imposed after Italian unification in 1861. This period of large-scale immigration ended abruptly with the onset of the First World War in 1914 and, except for one year (1922), never fully resumed. Further immigration was greatly limited by several laws Congress passed in the 1920s.Following the unification, the unitary Italian state initially encouraged emigration to relieve economic pressures in the South. After the American Civil War, which resulted in over a half million killed or wounded, immigrant workers were recruited from Italy and elsewhere to fill the labor shortage caused by the war. In the United States, most Italians began their new lives as manual laborers in eastern cities, mining camps and farms. The descendants of the Italian immigrants gradually rose from a lower economic class in the first generation to a level comparable to the national average by 1970. The Italian community has often been characterized by strong ties to family, the Catholic Church, fraternal organizations, and political parties.\n\n","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.353","Jainism","","Jainism (), traditionally known as Jain Dharma, is an ancient Indian religion. Followers of Jainism are called ""Jains"", a word derived from the Sanskrit word jina (victor) referring to the path of victory in crossing over life's stream of rebirths by destroying karma through an ethical and spiritual life. Jainism is a transtheistic religion, and Jains trace their spiritual ideas and history through a succession of twenty-four victorious saviours and teachers known as tirthankaras, with the first being Rishabhanatha, who according to Jain tradition lived millions of years ago, the twenty-third Tirthankara Parshvanatha in 900 BCE, and the twenty-fourth Tirthankara the Mah\u0101v\u012bra around 500 BCE. Jains believe that Jainism is an eternal dharma with the tirthankaras guiding every cycle of the Jain cosmology. Their religious texts are called Agamas.\nThe main religious premises of Jainism are ahi\u1e43s\u0101 (non-violence), anek\u0101ntav\u0101da (many-sidedness), aparigraha (non-attachment) and asceticism. Devout Jains take five main vows: ahi\u1e43s\u0101 (non-violence), satya (truth), asteya (not stealing), brahmacharya (celibacy or chastity or sexual continence), and aparigraha (non-possessiveness). These principles have affected Jain culture in many ways, such as leading to a predominantly vegetarian lifestyle that avoids harm to animals and their life cycles. Parasparopagraho J\u012bv\u0101n\u0101m (the function of souls is to help one another) is the motto of Jainism. \u1e46am\u014dk\u0101ra mantra is the most common and basic prayer in Jainism.Jainism has two major ancient sub-traditions, Digambaras and \u015av\u0113t\u0101mbaras; Several smaller sub-traditions emerged in the 2nd millennium CE. The Digambaras and \u015av\u0113t\u0101mbaras have different views on ascetic practices, gender and which Jain texts can be considered canonical. Jain mendicants are found in all Jain sub-traditions except Kanji Panth sub-tradition, with laypersons (\u015br\u0101vakas) supporting the mendicants' spiritual pursuits with resources.\nJainism has between four and five million followers, with most Jains residing in India. Outside India, some of the largest Jain communities are present in Canada, Europe, Kenya, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Suriname, Fiji, and the United States. Jainism is also growing in Japan, where more than 5,000 ethnic Japanese families have converted to Jainism. Major Jain festivals include Paryushana and Daslakshana, Ashtanika, Mahavir Janma Kalyanak, and Dipawali.","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.354","Japanese American internment","","The internment of Japanese Americans in the United States during World War II was the forced relocation and incarceration in concentration camps in the western interior of the country of about 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry, most of whom lived on the Pacific Coast. Sixty-two percent of the internees were United States citizens. These actions were ordered by President Franklin D. Roosevelt shortly after Imperial Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor.Of 127,000 Japanese Americans living in the continental United States at the time of the Pearl Harbor attack, 112,000 resided on the West Coast. About 80,000 were Nisei (literal translation: ""second generation""; American-born Japanese with U.S. citizenship) and Sansei (""third generation""; the children of Nisei). The rest were Issei (""first generation"") immigrants born in Japan who were ineligible for U.S. citizenship under U.S. law.Japanese Americans were incarcerated based on local population concentrations and regional politics. More than 112,000 Japanese Americans living on the West Coast were forced into interior camps. However, in Hawaii, where 150,000-plus Japanese Americans composed over one-third of the population, only 1,200 to 1,800 were also interned. The internment is considered to have resulted more from racism than from any security risk posed by Japanese Americans. California defined anyone with 1/16th or more Japanese lineage as sufficient to be interned. Colonel Karl Bendetsen, the architect behind the program, went so far as saying anyone with ""one drop of Japanese blood"" qualified.Roosevelt authorized Executive Order 9066, issued on February 19, 1942, which allowed regional military commanders to designate ""military areas"" from which ""any or all persons may be excluded."" Although the executive order did not mention Japanese Americans, this authority was used to declare that all people of Japanese ancestry were required to leave Alaska and the military exclusion zones from all of California and parts of Oregon, Washington, and Arizona, except for those in government camps. Internment was not limited to those of Japanese ancestry, but included a relatively smaller number\u2014though still totalling well over ten thousand\u2014of people of German and Italian ancestry and Germans deported from Latin America to the U.S.  Approximately 5,000 Japanese Americans relocated outside the exclusion zone before March 1942, while some 5,500 community leaders had been arrested immediately after the Pearl Harbor attack and thus were already in custody.The United States Census Bureau assisted the internment efforts by spying and providing confidential neighborhood information on Japanese Americans. The Bureau denied its role for decades despite scholarly evidence to the contrary, and its role became more widely acknowledged by 2007. In 1944, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the removal by ruling against Fred Korematsu's appeal for violating an exclusion order. The Court limited its decision to the validity of the exclusion orders, avoiding the issue of the incarceration of U.S. citizens without due process.In 1980, under mounting pressure from the Japanese American Citizens League and redress organizations, President Jimmy Carter opened an investigation to determine whether the decision to put Japanese Americans into concentration camps had been justified by the government. He appointed the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians (CWRIC) to investigate the camps. The Commission's report, titled Personal Justice Denied, found little evidence of Japanese disloyalty at the time and concluded that the incarceration had been the product of racism. It recommended that the government pay reparations to the internees. In 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed into law the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 which apologized for the internment on behalf of the U.S. government and authorized a payment of $20,000 (equivalent to $43,000 in 2019) to each camp survivor. The legislation admitted that government actions were based on ""race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership."" The U.S. government eventually disbursed more than $1.6 billion (equivalent to $3,460,000,000 in 2019) in reparations to 82,219 Japanese Americans who had been interned and their heirs.\n\n","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.355","Japanese language","","Japanese (\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e, Nihongo [\u0272iho\u014b\u0261o] (listen)) is an East Asian language spoken by about 128 million people, primarily in Japan, where it is the national language. It is a member of the Japonic (or Japanese-Ryukyuan) language family, and its relation to other languages, such as Korean, is debated. Japanese has been grouped with language families such as Ainu, Austroasiatic, and the now-discredited Altaic, but none of these proposals has gained widespread acceptance.\nLittle is known of the language's prehistory, or when it first appeared in Japan. Chinese documents from the 3rd century recorded a few Japanese words, but substantial texts did not appear until the 8th century. During the Heian period (794\u20131185), Chinese had considerable influence on the vocabulary and phonology of Old Japanese. Late Middle Japanese (1185\u20131600) included changes in features that brought it closer to the modern language, and the first appearance of European loanwords. The standard dialect moved from the Kansai region to the Edo (modern Tokyo) region in the Early Modern Japanese period (early 17th century\u2013mid-19th century). Following the end of Japan's self-imposed isolation in 1853, the flow of loanwords from European languages increased significantly. English loanwords, in particular, have become frequent, and Japanese words from English roots have proliferated.\nJapanese is an agglutinative, mora-timed language with simple phonotactics, a pure vowel system, phonemic vowel and consonant length, and a lexically significant pitch-accent. Word order is normally subject\u2013object\u2013verb with particles marking the grammatical function of words, and sentence structure is topic\u2013comment. Sentence-final particles are used to add emotional or emphatic impact, or make questions. Nouns have no grammatical number or gender, and there are no articles. Verbs are conjugated, primarily for tense and voice, but not person. Japanese equivalents of adjectives are also conjugated. Japanese has a complex system of honorifics with verb forms and vocabulary to indicate the relative status of the speaker, the listener, and persons mentioned.\nJapanese has no genetic relationship with Chinese, but it makes extensive use of Chinese characters, or kanji (\u6f22\u5b57), in its writing system, and a large portion of its vocabulary is borrowed from Chinese. Along with kanji, the Japanese writing system primarily uses two syllabic (or moraic) scripts, hiragana (\u3072\u3089\u304c\u306a or \u5e73\u4eee\u540d) and katakana (\u30ab\u30bf\u30ab\u30ca or \u7247\u4eee\u540d). Latin script is used in a limited fashion, such as for imported acronyms, and the numeral system uses mostly Arabic numerals alongside traditional Chinese numerals.","wikipedia","5.10"
"3.356","Jehovah's Witnesses","","Jehovah's Witnesses is a millenarian restorationist Christian denomination with nontrinitarian beliefs distinct from mainstream Christianity. The group reports a worldwide membership of approximately 8.68 million adherents involved in evangelism and an annual Memorial attendance of over 20 million. Jehovah's Witnesses are directed by the Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses, a group of elders in Warwick, New York, United States, which establishes all doctrines based on its interpretations of the Bible. They believe that the destruction of the present world system at Armageddon is imminent, and that the establishment of God's kingdom over the earth is the only solution for all problems faced by humanity.The group emerged from the Bible Student movement founded in the late 1870s by Charles Taze Russell, who also co-founded Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society in 1881 to organize and print the movement's publications. A leadership dispute after Russell's death resulted in several groups breaking away, with Joseph Franklin Rutherford retaining control of the Watch Tower Society and its properties. Rutherford made significant organizational and doctrinal changes, including adoption of the name Jehovah's witnesses in 1931 to distinguish them from other Bible Student groups and symbolize a break with the legacy of Russell's traditions.Jehovah's Witnesses are best known for their door-to-door preaching, distributing literature such as The Watchtower and Awake!, and for refusing military service and blood transfusions. They consider the use of God's name vital for proper worship. They reject Trinitarianism, inherent immortality of the soul, and hellfire, which they consider to be unscriptural doctrines. They do not observe Christmas, Easter, birthdays or other holidays and customs they consider to have pagan origins incompatible with Christianity. They prefer to use their own Bible translation, the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, although their literature occasionally quotes and cites other Bible translations. Adherents commonly refer to their body of beliefs as ""The Truth"" and consider themselves to be ""in the Truth"". They consider secular society to be morally corrupt and under the influence of Satan, and most limit their social interaction with non-Witnesses. Congregational disciplinary actions include disfellowshipping, their term for formal expulsion and shunning, a last resort for what they consider serious offences. Baptized individuals who formally leave are considered disassociated and are also shunned. Disfellowshipped and disassociated individuals may eventually be reinstated if deemed repentant.The group's position regarding conscientious objection to military service and refusal to salute state symbols (like national anthems and flags) has brought it into conflict with some governments. Consequently, some Jehovah's Witnesses have been persecuted and their activities are banned or restricted in some countries. Persistent legal challenges by Jehovah's Witnesses have influenced legislation related to civil rights in several countries.The organization has received criticism regarding biblical translation, doctrines, and alleged coercion of its members. The Watch Tower Society has made various unfulfilled predictions about major biblical events such as Christ's Second Coming, the advent of God's Kingdom, and Armageddon. Their policies for handling cases of child sexual abuse have been the subject of various formal inquiries.","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.357","Jesus Christ","","Jesus (c.\u20094 BC \u2013 c.\u2009AD 30 / 33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a first-century Jewish preacher and religious leader. He is the central figure of Christianity. Most Christians believe he is the incarnation of God the Son and the awaited Messiah (the Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament.Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the Jesus portrayed in the Bible reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and began his own ministry. He preached orally and was often referred to as ""rabbi"". Jesus debated with fellow Jews on how to best follow God, engaged in healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, turned over to the Roman government, and crucified on the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the early Church.Christian doctrines include the beliefs that Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit, was born of a virgin named Mary, performed miracles, founded the Christian Church, died by crucifixion as a sacrifice to achieve atonement for sin, rose from the dead, and ascended into Heaven, from where he will return. Most Christians believe Jesus enables people to be reconciled to God. The Nicene Creed asserts that Jesus will judge the living and the dead either before or after their bodily resurrection, an event tied to the Second Coming of Jesus in Christian eschatology. The great majority of Christians worship Jesus as the incarnation of God the Son, the second of three persons of the Trinity. A minority of Christian denominations reject Trinitarianism, wholly or partly, as non-scriptural. The birth of Jesus is celebrated annually on December 25 (or various dates in January by some eastern churches) as Christmas. His crucifixion is honored on Good Friday and his resurrection on Easter. The widely used calendar era ""AD"", from the Latin anno Domini (""year of the Lord""), and the equivalent  alternative ""CE"", are based on the approximate birthdate of Jesus.Jesus is also revered outside of Christianity. In Islam, Jesus (commonly transliterated as Isa) is considered one of God's important prophets and the Messiah. Muslims believe Jesus was born of a virgin, but was neither God nor the son of God. The Quran states that Jesus never claimed divinity. Most Muslims do not believe that he was crucified, but that he was physically raised into Heaven by God. In contrast, Judaism rejects the belief that Jesus was the awaited Messiah, arguing that he did not fulfill Messianic prophecies, and was neither divine nor resurrected.\n\n","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.358","Jesus Freaks","","Jesus freak is a term arising from the late 1960s and early 1970s counterculture and is frequently used as a pejorative for those involved in the Jesus movement. As Tom Wolfe illustrates in The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, the term ""freak"" with a preceding qualifier was a strictly neutral term and described any counterculture member with a specific interest in a given subject; hence ""acid freak"" and ""Jesus freak"". The term ""freak"" was in common-enough currency that Hunter S. Thompson's failed bid for sheriff of Pitkin County, Colorado was as a member of the ""Freak Power"" party. However, many later members of the movement, those misunderstanding the countercultural roots believed the term to be negative, and co-opted and embraced the term, and its usage broadened to describe a Christian subculture throughout the hippie and back-to-the-land movements that focused on universal love and pacifism, and relished the radical nature of Jesus's message. Jesus freaks often carried and distributed copies of the Good News for Modern Man, a 1966 translation of the New Testament written in modern English. In Australia, and other countries, the term Jesus freak, along with Bible basher, is still used in a derogatory manner. In Germany, there is a Christian youth culture, also called Jesus Freaks  International, that claims to have its roots in the U.S. movement.","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.359","Jewish Americans","","American Jews, or Jewish Americans, are Americans who are Jews, whether by religion, ethnicity, culture, or nationality. Today the Jewish community in the United States consists primarily of Ashkenazi Jews, who descend from diaspora Jewish populations of Central and Eastern Europe and comprise about 90\u201395% of the American Jewish population. Most American Ashkenazim are US-born, with a dwindling number of now-elderly earlier immigrants, as well as some more recent foreign-born immigrants.\nDuring the colonial era, prior to the mass immigration of Ashkenazim, Spanish and Portuguese Jews represented the bulk of America's then-small Jewish population, and while their descendants are a minority today, they, along with an array of other Jewish communities, represented the remainder of American Jews, including other more recent Sephardic Jews, Mizrahi Jews, various other ethnically Jewish communities, as well as a smaller number of converts to Judaism. The American Jewish community manifests a wide range of Jewish cultural traditions, encompassing the full spectrum of Jewish religious observance.\nDepending on religious definitions and varying population data, the United States has the largest or second largest Jewish community in the world, after Israel. In 2012, the American Jewish population was estimated at between 5.5 million and eight million, depending on the definition of the term, which constitutes between 1.7% and 2.6% of the total U.S. population.","wikipedia","5.5"

Jewish ethnicity, nationhood, and religion are strongly interrelated, as Judaism is the ethnic religion of the Jewish people, while its observance varies from strict observance to complete nonobservance.Jews originated as an ethnic and religious group in the Middle East during the second millennium BCE, in the part of the Levant known as the Land of Israel. The Merneptah Stele appears to confirm the existence of a people of Israel somewhere in Canaan as far back as the 13th century BCE (Late Bronze Age). The Israelites, as an outgrowth of the Canaanite population, consolidated their hold with the emergence of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. Some consider that these Canaanite sedentary Israelites melded with incoming nomadic groups known as 'Hebrews'. Though few sources mention the exilic periods in detail, the experience of diaspora life, from the Ancient Egyptian rule over the Levant, to Assyrian captivity and exile, to Babylonian captivity and exile, to Seleucid Imperial rule, to the Roman occupation and exile, and the historical relations between Jews and their homeland thereafter, became a major feature of Jewish history, identity and memory. Prior to World War II, the worldwide Jewish population reached a peak of 16.7 million, representing around 0.7% of the world population at that time. Approximately 6 million Jews were systematically murdered during the Holocaust. Since then the population has slowly risen again, and as of 2018 was estimated at 14.6\u201317.8 million by the Berman Jewish DataBank, less than 0.2% of the total world population.The modern State of Israel is the only country where Jews form a majority of the population.

"3.362","Jim Crow laws","","Jim Crow laws were state and local laws that enforced racial segregation in the Southern United States. All were enacted in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by white Democratic-dominated state legislatures after the Reconstruction period. The laws were enforced until 1965. In practice, Jim Crow laws mandated racial segregation in all public facilities in the states of the former Confederate States of America and other states, starting in the 1870s and 1880s. Jim Crow laws were upheld in 1896 in the case of Plessy vs. Ferguson, in which the U.S. Supreme Court laid out its ""separate but equal"" legal doctrine for facilities for African Americans. Moreover, public education had essentially been segregated since its establishment in most of the South after the Civil War (1861\u201365).\nThe legal principle of ""separate but equal"" racial segregation was extended to public facilities and transportation, including the coaches of interstate trains and buses. Facilities for African Americans and Native Americans were consistently inferior and underfunded compared to the facilities for white Americans; sometimes, there were no facilities for people of color. As a body of law, Jim Crow institutionalized economic, educational, and social disadvantages for African Americans and other people of color living in the South.Jim Crow laws and Jim Crow state constitutional provisions mandated the segregation of public schools, public places, and public transportation, and the segregation of restrooms, restaurants, and drinking fountains for whites and blacks. The U.S. military was already segregated. President Woodrow Wilson, a Southern Democrat, initiated the segregation of federal workplaces in 1913.In 1954, segregation of public schools (state-sponsored) was declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court under Chief Justice Earl Warren in landmark case Brown v. Board of Education. In some states, it took many years to implement this decision, while the Warren Court continued to rule against the Jim Crow laws in other cases such as Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States (1964).  Generally, the remaining Jim Crow laws were overruled by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.363","Judas Iscariot","","Judas Iscariot (; Biblical Hebrew: \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4\u200e, romanized: Yeh\u00fbd\u00e2h, lit. 'God is praised'; Greek: \u1fda\u03bf\u03cd\u03b4\u03b1\u03c2 \u1fda\u03c3\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03ce\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2) (died c.\u200930 \u2013 c.\u200933 AD) was a disciple and one of the original Twelve Disciples of Jesus Christ. According to all four canonical gospels, Judas betrayed Jesus to the Sanhedrin in the Garden of Gethsemane by kissing him and addressing him as ""rabbi"" to reveal his identity to the crowd who had come to arrest him. His name is often used synonymously with betrayal or treason. Judas's epithet Iscariot most likely means he came from the village of Kerioth, but this explanation is not universally accepted and many other possibilities have been suggested.\nThe Gospel of Mark, the earliest gospel, gives no motive for Judas's betrayal, but does present Jesus predicting it at the Last Supper, an event also described in all the later gospels. The Gospel of Matthew 26:15 states that Judas committed the betrayal in exchange for thirty pieces of silver. The Gospel of Luke 22:3 and the Gospel of John 13:27 suggest that he was possessed by Satan. According to Matthew 27:1\u201310, after learning that Jesus was to be crucified, Judas attempted to return the money he had been paid for his betrayal to the chief priests and committed suicide by hanging. The priests used the money to buy a field to bury strangers in, which was called the ""Field of Blood"" because it had been bought with blood money. The Book of Acts 1:18 quotes Peter as saying that Judas used the money to buy the field himself and, he ""[fell] headlong... burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out."" His place among the Twelve Apostles was later filled by Matthias.\nDue to his notorious role in all the gospel narratives, Judas remains a controversial figure in Christian history. For instance, Judas's betrayal is seen as setting in motion the events that led to Jesus's crucifixion and resurrection, which, according to traditional Christian theology, brought salvation to humanity. The Gnostic Gospel of Judas \u2013 rejected by the proto-orthodox Church as heretical \u2013 portrays Judas's actions as done in obedience to instructions given to him by Jesus, and that he alone amongst the disciples knew Jesus's true teachings. Since the Middle Ages, Judas has sometimes been portrayed as a personification of the Jewish people and his betrayal has been used to justify Christian antisemitism.","wikipedia","5.1"

A traditional Kabbalist in Judaism is called a Mequbb\u0101l (\u05de\u05b0\u05e7\u05d5\u05bc\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05dc). The definition of Kabbalah varies according to the tradition and aims of those following it, from its religious origin as an integral part of Judaism, to its later adaptations in Western esotericism (Christian Kabbalah and Hermetic Qabalah). Jewish Kabbalah is a set of esoteric teachings meant to explain the relationship between God, the unchanging, eternal, and mysterious Ein Sof (\u05d0\u05b5\u05d9\u05df \u05e1\u05d5\u05b9\u05e3, ""The Infinite""), and the mortal and finite universe (God's creation). It forms the foundation of mystical religious interpretations within Judaism.Jewish Kabbalists originally developed their own transmission of sacred texts within the realm of Jewish tradition, and often use classical Jewish scriptures to explain and demonstrate its mystical teachings. These teachings are held by followers in Judaism to define the inner meaning of both the Hebrew Bible and traditional rabbinic literature and their formerly concealed transmitted dimension, as well as to explain the significance of Jewish religious observances. One of the fundamental kabbalistic texts, the Zohar, was first published in the 13th century, and the almost universal form adhered to in modern Judaism is Lurianic Kabbalah.\nTraditional practitioners believe its earliest origins pre-date world religions, forming the primordial blueprint for Creation's philosophies, religions, sciences, arts, and political systems. Historically, Kabbalah emerged after earlier forms of Jewish mysticism, in 12th- to 13th-century Spain and Southern France, and was reinterpreted during the Jewish mystical renaissance of 16th-century Ottoman Palestine. Isaac Luria is considered the father of contemporary Kabbalah; Lurianic Kabbalah was popularised in the form of Hasidic Judaism from the 18th century onwards. During the 20th-century, academic interest in Kabbalistic texts led primarily by the Jewish historian Gershom Scholem has inspired the development of historical research on Kabbalah in the field of Judaic studies.","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.367","Kashmir","","Kashmir is the northernmost geographical region of the Indian subcontinent. Until the mid-19th century, the term ""Kashmir"" denoted only the Kashmir Valley between the Great Himalayas and the Pir Panjal Range. Today, the term encompasses a larger area that includes the Indian-administered territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, the Pakistani-administered territories of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, and Chinese-administered territories of Aksai Chin and the Trans-Karakoram Tract.In the first half of the first millennium, the Kashmir region became an important centre of Hinduism and later of Buddhism; later still, in the ninth century, Kashmir Shaivism arose. In 1339, Shah Mir became the first Muslim ruler of Kashmir, inaugurating the Salatin-i-Kashmir or Shah Mir dynasty. Kashmir was part of the Mughal Empire from 1586 to 1751, and thereafter, until 1820, of the Afghan Durrani Empire. That year, the Sikhs, under Ranjit Singh, annexed Kashmir. In 1846, after the Sikh defeat in the First Anglo-Sikh War, and upon the purchase of the region from the British under the Treaty of Amritsar, the Raja of Jammu, Gulab Singh, became the new ruler of Kashmir.

Food that may be consumed is deemed kosher ( in English, Yiddish: \u05db\u05bc\u05e9\u05e8\u200e), from the Ashkenazi pronunciation of the Hebrew term kash\u00e9r (\u05db\u05b8\u05bc\u05e9\u05b5\u05c1\u05e8), meaning ""fit"" (in this context: ""fit for consumption"").\nAlthough the details of the laws of kashrut are numerous and complex, they rest on a few basic principles:\n\nOnly certain types of mammals, birds and fish meeting specific criteria are kosher; the consumption of the flesh of any animals that do not meet these criteria, such as pork and shellfish, is forbidden\nKosher mammals and birds must be slaughtered according to a process known as shechita; blood may never be consumed and must be removed from meat by a process of salting and soaking in water for the meat to be permissible for use\nMeat and meat derivatives may never be mixed with milk and milk derivatives: separate equipment for the storage and preparation of meat-based and dairy-based foods must be usedEvery food that is considered kosher is also categorized as follows:\n\n""Meat"" products (also called b'sari or fleishig) are those that contain kosher meat, such as beef, bison or lamb, kosher poultry such as chicken, goose, duck or turkey, or derivatives of meat, such as animal gelatin; non-animal products that were processed on equipment used for meat or meat-derived products must also be considered as meat (b'chezkat basar)\n""Dairy"" products (also called halavi or milchig) contain milk or any derivatives such as butter or cheese; non-dairy products that were processed on equipment used for milk or milk-derived products must also be considered as milk (b'chezkat halav)\nPareve products contain neither meat, nor milk nor their respective derivatives, and include foods such as fish, eggs, grains, fruit and produce; they remain parev if they are not mixed with or processed using equipment that is used for any meat or dairy products.While any produce that grows from the earth, such as fruits, grains, vegetables and mushrooms, are always permissible, laws regarding the status of certain agricultural produce, especially that grown in the Land of Israel, such as tithes and produce of the Sabbatical year, impact their permissibility for consumption.\nMost of the basic laws of kashrut are derived from the Torah's books of Leviticus and Deuteronomy. Their details and practical application, however, are set down in the oral law (eventually codified in the Mishnah and Talmud) and elaborated on in the later rabbinical literature. Although the Torah does not state the rationale for most kashrut laws, some suggest that they are only tests of obedience, while others have suggested philosophical, practical and hygienic reasons.Over the past century, many kashrut certification agencies have started to certify products, manufacturers and restaurants as kosher, usually authorizing the use of a proprietary symbol called a hechsher on products or issuing a certificate, also called a hechsher, to be displayed by the food establishment,  which indicates that they are in compliance with the kosher laws.","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.369","Kennedy assassination","","John Fitzgerald Kennedy, the 35th President of the United States, was assassinated on November 22, 1963, at 12:30 p.m. Central Standard Time in Dallas, Texas, while riding in a presidential motorcade through Dealey Plaza. Kennedy was riding with his wife Jacqueline, Texas Governor John Connally, and Connally's wife Nellie when he was fatally shot by former U.S. Marine Lee Harvey Oswald firing in ambush from a nearby building. Governor Connally was seriously wounded in the attack. The motorcade rushed to Parkland Memorial Hospital where President Kennedy was pronounced dead about 30 minutes after the shooting; Connally recovered.\nOswald was arrested by the Dallas Police Department 70 minutes after the initial shooting. Oswald was charged under Texas state law with the murder of Kennedy, as well as that of Dallas policeman J. D. Tippit, who had been fatally shot a short time after the assassination. At 11:21 a.m. November 24, 1963, as live television cameras were covering his transfer from the city jail to the county jail, Oswald was fatally shot in the basement of Dallas Police Headquarters by Dallas nightclub operator Jack Ruby. Oswald was taken to Parkland Memorial Hospital where he soon died. Ruby was convicted of Oswald's murder, though it was later overturned on appeal, and Ruby died in prison in 1967 while awaiting a new trial.\nAfter a 10-month investigation, the Warren Commission concluded that Oswald assassinated Kennedy, that Oswald had acted entirely alone, and that Ruby had acted alone in killing Oswald. Kennedy was the eighth and most recent US President to die in office, and the fourth (following Lincoln, Garfield, and McKinley) to be assassinated. Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson automatically assumed the Presidency upon Kennedy's death.A later investigation, the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) agreed with the Warren Commission that the injuries that Kennedy and Connally sustained were caused by Oswald's three rifle shots, but they also concluded that Kennedy was ""probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy"" as analysis of a dictabelt audio recording pointed to the existence of an additional gunshot and therefore ""... a high probability that two gunmen fired at [the] President"". The Committee was not able to identify any individuals or groups involved with the possible conspiracy. In addition, the HSCA found that the original federal investigations were ""seriously flawed"" with respect to information-sharing and the possibility of conspiracy. As recommended by the HSCA, the dictabelt evidence suggesting conspiracy was subsequently re-examined and rejected. It was determined that the dictabelt recorded different gunshots which were fired at another location in Dallas and at a different time which was not related to the assassination.In light of the investigative reports determining that ""reliable acoustic data do not support a conclusion that there was a second gunman"", the U.S. Justice Department concluded active investigations and stated ""that no persuasive evidence can be identified to support the theory of a conspiracy in ... the assassination of President Kennedy"". However, Kennedy's assassination is still the subject of widespread debate and has spawned numerous conspiracy theories and alternative scenarios. Polls conducted from 1966 to 2004 found that up to 80 percent of Americans suspected that there was a plot or cover-up.","wikipedia","5.6"

"3.372","Kombucha","","Kombucha (also tea mushroom, tea fungus, or Manchurian mushroom when referring to the culture; botanical name Medusomyces gisevii) is a fermented, slightly alcoholic, lightly effervescent, sweetened black or green tea drink commonly consumed for its supposed health benefits. Sometimes the beverage is called kombucha tea to distinguish it from the culture of bacteria and yeast. Juice, spices, fruit or other flavorings are often added to enhance the taste of the beverage. \nKombucha is thought to have originated in Manchuria where the drink is traditionally consumed, or in Russia and Eastern Europe. Kombucha is now homebrewed globally, and also bottled and sold commercially by various companies.Kombucha is produced by fermenting sugared tea using a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast (SCOBY) commonly called a ""mother"" or ""mushroom"". The microbial populations in a SCOBY vary; the yeast component generally includes Saccharomyces cerevisiae, along with other species; the bacterial component almost always includes Gluconacetobacter xylinus to oxidize yeast-produced alcohols to acetic acid (and other acids). Although the SCOBY is commonly called ""tea fungus"" or ""mushroom"", it is actually ""a symbiotic growth of acetic acid bacteria and osmophilic yeast species in a zoogleal mat [biofilm]"". The living bacteria are said to be probiotic, one of the reasons for the popularity of the drink.Numerous implausible health benefits have been attributed to drinking kombucha. These include claims for treating AIDS, aging, anorexia, arthritis, atherosclerosis, cancer, constipation, and diabetes, but there is no evidence to support any of these claims. Moreover, the beverage has caused rare cases of serious adverse effects, including fatalities, possibly arising from contamination during home preparation. Therefore, the potential harms from drinking kombucha may outweigh the benefits, so it is not recommended for therapeutic purposes.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.373","Korean War","","The Korean War (in South Korean Korean: \ud55c\uad6d\uc804\uc7c1; Hanja: \u97d3\u570b\u6230\u722d; RR: Hanguk Jeonjaeng, ""Korean War""; in North Korean Korean: \uc870\uad6d\ud574\ubc29\uc804\uc7c1; Hanja: \u7956\u570b\u89e3\u653e\u6230\u722d; MR: Choguk haebang ch\u014fnjaeng, ""Fatherland Liberation War""; 25 June 1950 \u2013 27 July 1953) was a war between North Korea (with the support of China and the Soviet Union) and South Korea (with the support of the United Nations, principally from the United States). The war began on 25 June 1950 when North Korea invaded South Korea.At the end of World War II, the Soviet Union and the United States liberated Korea from imperial Japanese colonial control on 15 August 1945. After the war had ended, Korea was divided at the 38th parallel into two zones of occupation, the Soviets administered the northern half and the Americans administered the southern half. With the border set at the 38th parallel in 1948, two sovereign states were established as a result of geopolitical tensions of the Cold War (between the Soviet Union and the United States). A socialist state was established in the north under the communist leadership of Kim Il-sung and a capitalist state in the south under the anti-communist leadership of Syngman Rhee. Both governments of the two new Korean states claimed to be the sole legitimate government of all of Korea, and neither accepted the border as permanent. \nThe conflict escalated into warfare when North Korean military (Korean People's Army, KPA) forces\u2014supported by the Soviet Union and China\u2014crossed the border and advanced into South Korea on 25 June 1950. The United Nations Security Council authorized the formation of the United Nations Command and the dispatch of forces to Korea to repel what was recognized as a North Korean invasion. Twenty-one countries of the United Nations eventually contributed to the UN force, with the United States providing around 90% of the military personnel.After the first two months of war, South Korean Army (ROKA) and the US forces rapidly dispatched to Korea were on the point of defeat. As a result, the ROKA and US troops retreated to a small area behind a defensive line known as the Pusan Perimeter. In September 1950, an amphibious UN counter-offensive was launched at Incheon, and cut off many KPA troops in South Korea. Those who escaped envelopment and capture were forced back north. UN forces invaded North Korea in October 1950 and moved rapidly towards the Yalu River\u2014the border with China\u2014but on 19 October 1950, Chinese forces of the People's Volunteer Army (PVA) crossed the Yalu and entered the war. The surprise Chinese intervention triggered a retreat of UN forces back below the 38th Parallel by late December.\nIn these and subsequent battles, Seoul changed hands four times, and the last two years of fighting became a war of attrition, with the front line close to the 38th Parallel. The war in the air, however, was never a stalemate. North Korea was subject to a massive U.S. bombing campaign. Jet fighters confronted each other in air-to-air combat for the first time in history, and Soviet pilots covertly flew in defense of their communist allies.\nThe fighting ended on 27 July 1953, when the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed. The agreement created the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) to separate North and South Korea, and allowed the return of prisoners. However, no peace treaty was ever signed, and the two Koreas are technically still at war, engaged in a frozen conflict. In April 2018, the leaders of North and South Korea met at the DMZ and agreed to work towards a treaty to formally end the Korean War.The Korean War was among the most destructive conflicts of the modern era, with approximately 3 million war fatalities and a larger proportional civilian death toll than World War II or the Vietnam War. It incurred the destruction of virtually all of Korea's major cities, thousands of massacres by both sides (including the mass killing of tens of thousands of suspected communists by the South Korean government), and the torture and starvation of prisoners of war by the North Korean command. North Korea became among the most heavily-bombed countries in history.","wikipedia","['5.5','5.6']"
"3.374","Kosovo War","","The Kosovo War was an armed conflict in Kosovo that started in late February 1998 and lasted until 11 June 1999. It was fought by the forces of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (i.e. Serbia and Montenegro), which controlled Kosovo before the war, and the Kosovo Albanian rebel group known as the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), with air support from the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) from 24 March 1999, and ground support from the Albanian army.The KLA, formed in the early 1990s to fight against Serbian persecution of Kosovo Albanians, initiated its first campaign in 1995 when it launched attacks against Serbian law enforcement in Kosovo. In June 1996 the group claimed responsibility for acts of sabotage targeting Kosovo police stations. In 1997, the organisation acquired a large amount of arms through weapons smuggling from Albania, following a rebellion in which weapons were looted from the country's police and army posts. In early 1998, KLA attacks targeting Yugoslav authorities in Kosovo resulted in an increased presence of Serb paramilitaries and regular forces who subsequently began pursuing a campaign of retribution targeting KLA sympathisers and political opponents; this campaign killed 1,500 to 2,000 civilians and KLA combatants.After attempts at a diplomatic solution failed, NATO intervened, justifying the campaign in Kosovo as a ""humanitarian war"". This precipitated a mass expulsion of Kosovar Albanians as the Yugoslav forces continued to fight during the aerial bombardment of Yugoslavia (March\u2013June 1999). By 2000, investigations had recovered the remains of almost three thousand victims of all ethnicities, and in 2001 a United Nations administered Supreme Court, based in Kosovo, found that there had been ""a systematic campaign of terror, including murders, rapes, arsons and severe maltreatments"", but that Yugoslav troops had tried to remove rather than eradicate the Albanian population.The war ended with the Kumanovo Treaty, with Yugoslav and Serb forces agreeing to withdraw from Kosovo to make way for an international presence. The Kosovo Liberation Army disbanded soon after this, with some of its members going on to fight for the U\u00c7PMB in the Pre\u0161evo Valley and others joining the National Liberation Army (NLA) and Albanian National Army (ANA) during the armed ethnic conflict in Macedonia, while others went on to form the Kosovo Police. After the war, a list was compiled which documented that over 13,500 people were killed or went missing during the two year conflict. The Yugoslav and Serb forces caused the displacement of between 1.2 million to 1.45 million Kosovo Albanians. After the war, around 200,000 Serbs, Romani and other non-Albanians fled Kosovo and many of the remaining civilians were victims of abuse. Serbia became home to the highest number of refugees and internally displaced persons in Europe.The NATO bombing campaign has remained controversial, as it did not gain the approval of the UN Security Council and because it caused at least 488 Yugoslav civilian deaths, including substantial numbers of Kosovar refugees.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.375","Ku Klux Klan","","The Ku Klux Klan (), commonly called the KKK or the Klan, is an American white supremacist hate group, whose primary target is African Americans. The Klan has existed in three distinct eras at different points in time during the history of the United States. Each has advocated extremist reactionary positions such as white nationalism, anti-immigration and\u2014especially in later iterations\u2014Nordicism and anti-Catholicism. Historically, the first Klan used terrorism \u2013 both physical assault and murder \u2013 against politically active blacks and their allies in the South in the late 1860s, until it was suppressed around 1872.  All three movements have called for the ""purification"" of American society and all are considered ""right-wing extremist"" organizations. In each era, membership was secret and estimates of the total were highly exaggerated by both friends and enemies.\nKnown as the \u201cInvisible Empire of the South,\u201d the first Klan flourished in the Southern United States in the late 1860s during Reconstruction, then died out by the early 1870s. It sought to overthrow the Republican state governments in the South, especially by using violence against African-American leaders. Each chapter was autonomous and highly secret as to membership and plans. Its numerous chapters across the South were suppressed around 1871, through federal law enforcement. Members made their own, often colorful, costumes: robes, masks and conical hats, designed to be terrifying and to hide their identities.The second Klan started small in Georgia in 1915. It grew after 1920  and flourished nationwide in the early and mid-1920s, including urban areas of the Midwest and West. Taking inspiration from D. W. Griffith's 1915 silent film The Birth of a Nation, which mythologized the founding of the first Klan, it employed marketing techniques and a popular fraternal organization structure. Rooted in local Protestant communities, it sought to maintain white supremacy, often took a pro-Prohibition stance, and it opposed Catholics and Jews, while also stressing its opposition to the alleged political power of the Pope and the Catholic Church.  This second organization was funded by initiation fees and selling its members a standard white costume.  The chapters did not have dues. It used K-words which were similar to those used by the first Klan, while adding cross burnings and mass parades to intimidate others. It rapidly declined in the later half of the 1920s.\nThe third and current manifestation of the KKK emerged after 1950, in the form of localized and isolated groups that use the KKK name. They have focused on opposition to the civil rights movement, often using violence and murder to suppress activists. It is classified as a hate group by the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center. As of 2016, the Anti-Defamation League puts total KKK membership nationwide at around 3,000, while the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) puts it at 6,000 members total.The second and third incarnations of the Ku Klux Klan made frequent references to America's ""Anglo-Saxon"" blood, hearkening back to 19th-century nativism. Although members of the KKK swear to uphold Christian morality, virtually every Christian denomination has officially denounced the KKK.","wikipedia","5.1"

"3.378","Lactose intolerance","","Lactose intolerance is when a person has symptoms due to a decreased ability to digest lactose, a sugar found in dairy products. Those affected vary in the amount of lactose they can tolerate before symptoms develop. Symptoms may include abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, gas, and nausea. These symptoms typically start thirty minutes to two hours after eating or drinking milk-based food. Their severity typically depends on the amount a person eats or drinks. Lactose intolerance does not cause damage to the gastrointestinal tract.Lactose intolerance is due to the lack of the enzyme lactase in the small intestines to break lactose down into glucose and galactose. There are four types: primary, secondary, developmental, and congenital. Primary lactose intolerance occurs as the amount of lactase declines as people age. Secondary lactose intolerance is due to injury to the small intestine such as from infection, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, or other diseases. Developmental lactose intolerance may occur in premature babies and usually improves over a short period of time. Congenital lactose intolerance is an extremely rare genetic disorder in which little or no lactase is made from birth.Diagnosis may be confirmed if symptoms resolve following eliminating lactose from the diet. Other supporting tests include a hydrogen breath test and a stool acidity test. Other conditions that may produce similar symptoms include irritable bowel syndrome, celiac disease, and inflammatory bowel disease. Lactose intolerance is different from a milk allergy. Management is typically by decreasing the amount of lactose in the diet, taking lactase supplements, or treating the underlying disease. People are usually able to drink at least one cup of milk per sitting without developing significant symptoms, with greater amounts tolerated if drunk with a meal or throughout the day.The exact number of adults with lactose intolerance is unknown. One estimate puts the average at 65% of the global population. Rates of lactose intolerance vary between racial groups being most common in Africans, Latinos, and Asians and least common in Europeans. Onset is typically in late childhood or early adulthood. The ability to digest lactose into adulthood evolved in several human populations independently, probably as an adaptation to the domestication of dairy animals 10,000 years ago.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.379","Ladin language","","Ladin (, also UK: ; autonym: ladin, Italian: ladino; German: Ladinisch) is a Romance language consisting of a group of dialects that some consider part of a unitary Rhaeto-Romance language,  mainly spoken in the Dolomite Mountains in Northern Italy in the provinces of South Tyrol, the Trentino, and the Belluno, by the Ladin people. It exhibits similarities to Swiss Romansh and Friulian.\nThe precise extension of the Ladin language area is the subject of scholarly debates. A more narrow perspective includes only the dialects of the valleys around the Sella group, while wider definitions comprise the dialects of adjacent valleys in the Province of Belluno and even dialects spoken in the northwestern Trentino.A standard written variety of Ladin (Ladin Dolomitan) has been developed by the Office for Ladin Language Planning as a common communication tool across the whole Ladin-speaking region, but it is not popular among Ladin speakers.\nLadin should not be confused with Ladino (i.e., Judeo-Spanish), which, although also Romance, is derived from Old Spanish.","wikipedia","5.10"
"3.380","Language revival","","Language revitalization, also referred to as language revival or reversing language shift, is an attempt to halt or reverse the decline of a language or to revive an extinct one. Those involved can include parties such as linguists, cultural or community groups, or governments. Some argue for a distinction between language revival (the resurrection of a dead language with no existing native speakers) and language revitalization (the rescue of a ""dying"" language). It has been pointed out that there has only been one successful instance of a complete language revival, that of the Hebrew language, creating a new generation of native speakers without any pre-existing native speakers as a model.Languages targeted for language revitalization include those whose use and prominence is severely limited. Sometimes various tactics of language revitalization can even be used to try to revive extinct languages. Though the goals of language revitalization vary greatly from case to case, they typically involve attempting to expand the number of speakers and use of a language, or trying to maintain the current level of use to protect the language from extinction or language death.\nReasons for revitalization vary. In recent times alone, it is estimated that more than 2000 languages have already become extinct. The UN estimates that more than half of the languages spoken today have fewer than 10,000 speakers and that a quarter have fewer than 1,000 speakers and that, unless there are some efforts to maintain them, over the next hundred years most of these will become extinct. These figures are often cited as reasons why language revitalization is necessary to preserve linguistic diversity. Culture and identity are also frequently cited reasons for language revitalization, when a language is perceived as a unique ""cultural treasure."" A community often sees language as a unique part of their culture, connecting them with their ancestors or with the land, making up an essential part of their history and self-image.Language revitalization is also closely tied to the linguistic field of language documentation. In this field, linguists attempt to create full records of a language's grammar, vocabulary, and linguistic features. This practice can often lead to more concern for the revitalization of a specific language on study. Furthermore, the task of documentation is often taken on with the goal of revitalization in mind.","wikipedia","5.10"
"3.381","Last Supper","","The Last Supper is the final meal that, in the Gospel accounts, Jesus shared with his apostles in Jerusalem before his crucifixion. The Last Supper is commemorated by Christians especially on Maundy Thursday. The Last Supper provides the scriptural basis for the Eucharist, also known as ""Holy Communion"" or ""The Lord's Supper"".The First Epistle to the Corinthians contains the earliest known mention of the Last Supper. The four canonical Gospels all state that the Last Supper took place towards the end of the week, after Jesus's triumphal entry into Jerusalem and that Jesus and his apostles shared a meal shortly before Jesus was crucified at the end of that week. During the meal Jesus predicts his betrayal by one of the apostles present, and foretells that before the next morning, Peter will thrice deny knowing him.The three Synoptic Gospels and the First Epistle to the Corinthians include the account of the institution of the Eucharist in which Jesus takes bread, breaks it and gives it to others, saying ""This is my body given to you"" (the apostles are not explicitly mentioned in the account in First Corinthians). The Gospel of John does not include this episode, but tells of Jesus washing the feet of the apostles, giving the new commandment ""to love one another as I have loved you"", and has a detailed farewell discourse by Jesus, calling the apostles who follow his teachings ""friends and not servants"", as he prepares them for his departure.Scholars have looked to the Last Supper as the source of early Christian Eucharist traditions. Others see the account of the Last Supper as derived from 1st-century eucharistic practice as described by Paul in the mid-50s.","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.382","Latinos","","Hispanic and Latino Americans (Spanish: estadounidenses hispanos, pronounced [esta\u00f0o.uni\u02c8\u00f0enses is\u02c8panos]) are Americans who are descendants of people from Iberia or Latin America. More generally, this demographic includes all Americans who identify as Hispanic (whether of full or partial ancestry). As of 2018, the Census Bureau estimated that there were almost 60 million Hispanics living the United States (about 18% of the overall population).""Origin"" can be viewed as the ancestry, nationality group, lineage or country of birth of the person or the person's parents or ancestors before their arrival in the United States. People who identify as Spanish or Hispanic may be of any race. As one of the only two specifically designated categories of ethnicity in the United States (the other being ""Not Hispanic or Latino""), Hispanics form a pan-ethnicity incorporating a diversity of inter-related cultural and linguistic heritages. Most Hispanic Americans are of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Salvadoran, Dominican, Guatemalan or Colombian origin. The predominant origin of regional Hispanic populations varies widely in different locations across the country.Hispanic Americans are the second fastest-growing ethnic group by percentage growth in the United States after Asian Americans. Hispanics overall are the second-largest ethnic group in the United States, after non-Hispanic whites. After Native Americans, Hispanics are the oldest ethnic group to inhabit much of what is today the United States. Many have Native American ancestry. Spain colonized large areas of what is today the American Southwest and West Coast, as well as Florida. Its holdings included present-day California, New Mexico, Nevada, Arizona and Texas, all of which were part of Mexico from its independence in 1821 until the end of the Mexican\u2013American War in 1848. Conversely, Hispanic immigrants to the New York/New Jersey metropolitan area derive from a broad spectrum of Latin American states.A study published in 2015 in the American Journal of Human Genetics, based on 23andMe data from 8,663 self-described Latinos, estimated that Latinos in the United States carried a mean of 65.1% European ancestry, 18.0% Native American ancestry, and 6.2% African ancestry. The study found that self-described Latinos from the Southwest, especially those along the Mexican border, had the highest mean levels of Native American ancestry.\n\n","wikipedia","5.6"

"3.384","Law enforcement","","Law enforcement is any system by which some members of government act in an organized manner to enforce the law by discovering, deterring, rehabilitating, or punishing people who violate the rules and norms governing that society.  Although the term encompasses entities such as courts and corrections, it is most frequently applied to those who directly engage in patrols or surveillance to dissuade and discover criminal activity, and those who investigate crimes and apprehend offenders, a task typically carried out by the police, sheriff or another law enforcement organization.  Although law enforcement may be most concerned with the prevention and punishment of crimes, organizations exist to discourage a wide variety of non-criminal violations of rules and norms, effected through the imposition of less severe consequences.  There are also different units in different police departments, including \u201cUndercover\u201d, \u201cDetective\u201d, \u201cCID\u201d, \u201cGang Task Force\u201d, \u201cDrug Task Force\u201d, ""Custody Enforcement"" (see Custody officer), this varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\n\n","wikipedia","5.0"

Laws have been enacted to criminalize ""obscene images of children, no matter how they are made"", for inciting abuse. Currently, countries that have made it illegal to possess (as well as create and distribute) sexual images of fictional characters who are described as or appear to be under eighteen years old include Australia, Canada, the Philippines, South Africa, South Korea, and the United Kingdom.","wikipedia","5.7"
"3.387","Liberalism","","Liberalism is a political and moral philosophy based on liberty, consent of the governed and equality before the law. Liberals espouse a wide array of views depending on their understanding of these principles, but they generally support free market, free trade, limited government, individual rights (including civil rights and human rights), capitalism, democracy, secularism, gender equality, racial equality, internationalism, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and freedom of religion. Yellow is the political colour most commonly associated with liberalism.Liberalism became a distinct movement in the Age of Enlightenment, when it became popular among Western philosophers and economists. Liberalism sought to replace the norms of hereditary privilege, state religion, absolute monarchy, the divine right of kings and traditional conservatism with representative democracy and the rule of law. Liberals also ended mercantilist policies, royal monopolies and other barriers to trade, instead promoting free trade and free markets. Philosopher John Locke is often credited with founding liberalism as a distinct tradition, based on the social contract, arguing that each man has a natural right to life, liberty and property and governments must not violate these rights. While the British liberal tradition has emphasized expanding democracy, French liberalism has emphasized rejecting authoritarianism and is linked to nation-building.Leaders in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the American Revolution of 1776 and the French Revolution of 1789 used liberal philosophy to justify the armed overthrow of royal tyranny. Liberalism started to spread rapidly especially after the French Revolution. The 19th century saw liberal governments established in nations across Europe and South America, whereas it was well-established alongside republicanism in the United States. In Victorian Britain, it was used to critique the political establishment, appealing to science and reason on behalf of the people. During 19th and early 20th century, liberalism in the Ottoman Empire and Middle East influenced periods of reform such as the Tanzimat and Al-Nahda as well as the rise of constitutionalism, nationalism and secularism. These changes, along with other factors, helped to create a sense of crisis within Islam, which continues to this day, leading to Islamic revivalism. Before 1920, the main ideological opponents of liberalism were communism, conservatism and socialism, but liberalism then faced major ideological challenges from new opponents, fascism and Marxism\u2013Leninism. During the 20th century, liberal ideas also spread even further, especially in Western Europe, as liberal democracies found themselves on the winning side in both world wars.In Europe and North America, the establishment of social liberalism (often called simply liberalism in the United States) became a key component in the expansion of the welfare state. Today, liberal parties continue to wield power and influence throughout the world. However, liberalism still has challenges to overcome in Africa and Asia. The fundamental elements of contemporary society have liberal roots. The early waves of liberalism popularised economic individualism while expanding constitutional government and parliamentary authority. Liberals sought and established a constitutional order that prized important individual freedoms, such as  freedom of speech and freedom of association; an independent judiciary and public trial by jury; and the abolition of aristocratic privileges. Later waves of modern liberal thought and struggle were strongly influenced by the need to expand civil rights.Liberals have advocated gender and racial equality in their drive to promote civil rights and a global civil rights movement in the 20th century achieved several objectives towards both goals. Continental European liberalism is divided between moderates and progressives, with the moderates tending to elitism and the progressives supporting the universalisation of fundamental institutions, such as universal suffrage, universal education and the expansion of property rights. Over time, the moderates displaced the progressives as the main guardians of continental European liberalism.","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.388","Liberalism in the United States","","Liberalism in the United States is a political philosophy centered on what liberals see as the unalienable rights of the individual. The fundamental liberal ideals of freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion for all belief systems and the separation of church and state, right to due process and equality under the law are widely accepted as a common foundation across the spectrum of liberal thought. It differs from liberalism elsewhere in the world because the United States never had a resident hereditary aristocracy and as such avoided much of the class warfare that swept Europe. According to Ian Adams, all American parties are ""liberal and always have been. Essentially, they espouse classical liberalism\u2014that is, a form of democratized Whig constitutionalism, plus the free market. The point of difference comes with the influence of social liberalism"".Modern liberalism includes issues such as same-sex marriage, reproductive and other women's rights, voting rights for all adult citizens, civil rights, environmental justice and government protection of the right to an adequate standard of living. National social services such as equal educational opportunities, access to health care and transportation infrastructure are intended to meet the responsibility to promote the general welfare of all citizens as established by the Constitution. Some liberals, who call themselves classical liberals, fiscal conservatives, or libertarians, support fundamental liberal ideals, but diverge from modern liberal thought, holding that economic freedom is more important than equality and that providing for the general welfare exceeds the legitimate role of government.Since the 1930s, the term liberalism (without a qualifier) usually refers in the United States to social liberalism, also known as modern liberalism, a political philosophy exemplified by Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal and later Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society. It is a form of social liberalism, whose accomplishments include the Works Progress Administration and the Social Security Act in 1935, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. It is also known as left liberalism in Germany, modern liberalism in the United States and new liberalism in the United Kingdom, a variety of liberalism that endorses a regulated market economy and the expansion of civil and political rights, with the common good viewed as harmonious with the freedom of the individual.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.386","Liberal media","","Media bias is the bias or perceived bias of journalists and news producers within the mass media in the selection of many events and stories that are reported and how they are covered.  The term ""media bias"" implies a pervasive or widespread bias contravening the standards of journalism, rather than the perspective of an individual journalist or article. The direction and degree of media bias in various countries is widely disputed.Practical limitations to media neutrality include the inability of journalists to report all available stories and facts, and the requirement that selected facts be linked into a coherent narrative. Government influence, including overt and covert censorship, biases the media in some countries, for example China, North Korea and Myanmar.  Market forces that result in a biased presentation include the ownership of the news source, concentration of media ownership, the selection of staff, the preferences of an intended audience,\nThere are a number of national and international watchdog groups that report on bias in the media.","wikipedia","5.13"
"3.389","Libertarianism","","Libertarianism (from Latin: libertas, meaning ""freedom""), or libertarism (from French: libertaire, meaning ""libertarian""), is a collection of political philosophies and movements that uphold liberty as a core principle. Libertarians seek to maximize political freedom and autonomy, emphasizing freedom of choice, voluntary association and individual judgement. Libertarians share a skepticism of authority and state power, but they diverge on the scope of their opposition to existing economic and political systems. Various schools of libertarian thought offer a range of views regarding the legitimate functions of state and private power, often calling for the restriction or dissolution of coercive social institutions. Different categorizations have been used to distinguish various forms of libertarianism. This is done to distinguish libertarian views on the nature of property and capital, usually along left\u2013right or socialist\u2013capitalist lines.Libertarianism originated as a form of left-wing politics such as anti-authoritarian and anti-state socialists like anarchists, especially social anarchists, but more generally libertarian communists/Marxists and libertarian socialists. These libertarians seek to abolish capitalism and private ownership of the means of production, or else to restrict their purview or effects to usufruct property norms, in favor of common or cooperative ownership and management, viewing private property as a barrier to freedom and liberty.Left-libertarian ideologies include anarchist schools of thought, alongside many other anti-paternalist, New Left schools of thought centered around economic egalitarianism as well as geolibertarianism, green politics, market-oriented left-libertarianism and the Steiner\u2013Vallentyne school. In the mid-20th century, right-libertarian ideologies such as anarcho-capitalism and minarchism co-opted the term libertarian to advocate laissez-faire capitalism and strong private property rights such as in land, infrastructure and natural resources. The latter is the dominant form of libertarianism in the United States, where it advocates civil liberties, natural law, free-market capitalism and a major reversal of the modern welfare state.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.390","Libyan civil war","","The Libyan Crisis refers to the ongoing conflicts in Libya, beginning with the Arab Spring protests of 2011, which led to a civil war, foreign military intervention, and the ousting and death of Muammar Gaddafi. The civil war's aftermath and proliferation of armed groups led to violence and instability across the country, which erupted into renewed civil war in 2014. The ongoing crisis in Libya has so far resulted in tens of thousands of casualties since the onset of violence in early 2011. During both civil wars, the output of Libya's economically crucial oil industry collapsed to a small fraction of its usual level, with most facilities blockaded or damaged by rival groups, despite having the largest oil reserves of any African country. U.S. President Barack Obama stated on 11 April 2016 that not preparing for a post-Gaddafi Libya was probably the ""worst mistake"" of his presidency.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.391","Life extension","","Life extension is the idea of extending the human lifespan, either modestly \u2013 through improvements in medicine \u2013 or dramatically by increasing the maximum lifespan beyond its generally settled limit of 125 years. The ability to achieve such dramatic changes, however, does not currently exist.Some researchers in this area, and ""life extensionists"", ""immortalists"" or ""longevists"" (those who wish to achieve longer lives themselves), believe that future breakthroughs in tissue rejuvenation, stem cells, regenerative medicine, molecular repair, gene therapy, pharmaceuticals, and organ replacement (such as with artificial organs or xenotransplantations) will eventually enable humans to have indefinite lifespans (agerasia) through complete rejuvenation to a healthy youthful condition. The ethical ramifications, if life extension becomes a possibility, are debated by bioethicists.\nThe sale of purported anti-aging products such as supplements and hormone replacement is a lucrative global industry. For example, the industry that promotes the use of hormones as a treatment for consumers to slow or reverse the aging process in the US market generated about $50 billion of revenue a year in 2009. The use of such products has not been proven to be effective or safe.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.392","Linguistics","","Linguistics is the scientific study of language. It involves analysing language form, language meaning, and language in context. Linguists traditionally analyse human language by observing an interplay between sound and meaning. Linguistics also deals with the social, cultural, historical and political factors that influence language, through which linguistic and language-based context is often determined. Research on language through the sub-branches of historical and evolutionary linguistics also focuses on how languages change and grow, particularly over an extended period of time.\nThe earliest activities in the documentation and description of language have been attributed to the 6th-century-BC Indian grammarian P\u0101\u1e47ini who wrote a formal description of the Sanskrit language in his A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b.Related areas of study include the disciplines of semiotics (the study of direct and indirect language through signs and symbols), literary criticism (the historical and ideological analysis of literature, cinema, art, or published material), translation (the conversion and documentation of meaning in written/spoken text from one language or dialect onto another), and speech-language pathology (a corrective method to cure phonetic disabilities and dis-functions at the cognitive level).","wikipedia","5.10"
"3.393","List of best-selling albums","","This is a list of the world's best-selling albums of recorded music. To appear on the list, the figure must have been published by a reliable source and the album must have sold at least 20 million copies. This list can contain any types of album, including studio albums, extended plays, greatest hits, compilations, various artists, soundtracks and remixes. The figures given do not take into account the resale of used albums.All albums included on this list have their available claimed figures supported by at least 30% in certified copies. The percentage amount of certified sales needed increases the newer the album is, so albums released before 1975 are only expected to have their claimed figures supported by at least 30% in certified copies. However, newer albums, such as 21 and Come Away with Me, are expected to have their claimed figures supported by at least 70% in certified copies. Certified copies are sourced from available online databases of local music industry associations. This is the reason why albums that would otherwise make the list, such as The Sound of Music, In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida, Parallel Lines, Spirits Having Flown, Private Dancer, Janet, Believe, Bolo Ta Ra Ra.., Human Clay, Laundry Service and Back to Black, have not been included. \nAs a result of the methodology that the American and Canadian certification-awarding bodies (the RIAA and Music Canada respectively) use, each disc in a multi-disc set is counted as one unit toward certification, leading to many double albums on the list\u2014such as Pink Floyd's The Wall and the Beatles' The Beatles\u2014being certified with a number double the number of copies sold there. Such albums have the certifications for the number of copies (not discs) shipped indicated. Conversely, the American certification level for double albums that fit onto one compact disc, such as the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack reflect the actual number of copies sold. In 2016, RIAA included streaming in addition to track sales and album sales based on the concept of album-equivalent unit for certification purposes, and certification therefore no longer reflects shipment alone. For example, in the update of the certification for Their Greatest Hits (1971\u20131975) by the Eagles in August 2018, the album was certified 38\u00d7 Platinum (increasing from the previous 29\u00d7 Platinum certification in 2006) based on the new criteria, making it then the album with the highest certification in the United States.Michael Jackson's Thriller, estimated to have sold 66 million copies worldwide, is the best-selling album. Although sales estimates for Thriller have been as high as 120 million copies, these sales figures are unreliable. Jackson also currently has the highest number of albums on the list with five, Celine Dion has four, while Whitney Houston, The Beatles and Madonna each have three.\nGroupings are based on different sales benchmarks, the highest being for claims of at least 40 million copies, and the lowest being for claims of 20\u201329 million copies. Albums are listed in order of number of copies sold and thereafter by the artist's first name. Markets' order within the table is based on the number of compact discs sold in each market, largest market at the top and smallest at the bottom.\n\n","wikipedia","5.12"
"3.394","Liturgy","","Liturgy is the customary public worship performed by a religious group. As a religious phenomenon, liturgy represents a communal response to and participation in the sacred through activity reflecting praise, thanksgiving, supplication or repentance. It forms a basis for establishing a relationship with a  divine agency, as well as with other participants in the liturgy.\nTechnically speaking, liturgy forms a subset of ritual. The word liturgy, sometimes equated in English as ""service"", refers to a formal ritual, which may or may not be elaborate, enacted by those who understand themselves to be participating in an action with the divine; examples include the Eastern Christian Divine Liturgy (Greek: \u0398\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u039b\u03b5\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03af\u03b1), and the Catholic Mass.\n\n","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.395","Longevity","","The word ""longevity"" is sometimes used as a synonym for ""life expectancy"" in demography.  However, the term longevity is sometimes meant to refer only to especially long-lived members of a population, whereas life expectancy is always defined statistically as the average number of years remaining at a given age. For example, a population's life expectancy at birth is the same as the average age at death for all people born in the same year (in the case of cohorts). Longevity is best thought of as a term for general audiences meaning 'typical length of life' and specific statistical definitions should be clarified when necessary.\nReflections on longevity have usually gone beyond acknowledging the brevity of human life and have included thinking about methods to extend life. Longevity has been a topic not only for the scientific community but also for writers of travel, science fiction, and utopian novels.\nThere are many difficulties in authenticating the longest human life span ever by modern verification standards, owing to inaccurate or incomplete birth statistics. Fiction, legend, and folklore have proposed or claimed life spans in the past or future vastly longer than those verified by modern standards, and longevity narratives and unverified longevity claims frequently speak of their existence in the present.\nA life annuity is a form of longevity insurance.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.396","Louisiana Purchase","","The Louisiana Purchase (French: Vente de la Louisiane 'Sale of Louisiana') was the acquisition of the territory of Louisiana by the United States from France in 1803. In return for fifteen million dollars, or approximately eighteen dollars per square mile, the United States nominally acquired a total of 828,000 sq mi (2,140,000 km2; 530,000,000 acres). However, France only controlled a small fraction of this area, with most of it inhabited by Native Americans; for the majority of the area, what the United States bought was the ""preemptive"" right to obtain Native American lands by treaty or by conquest, to the exclusion of other colonial powers. The total cost of all subsequent treaties and financial settlements over the land has been estimated to be around 2.6 billion dollars.The Kingdom of France had controlled the Louisiana territory from 1699 until it was ceded to Spain in 1762. In 1800, Napoleon, then the First Consul of the French Republic, regained ownership of Louisiana as part of a broader project to re-establish a French colonial empire in North America. However, France's failure to put down a revolt in Saint-Domingue, coupled with the prospect of renewed warfare with the United Kingdom, prompted Napoleon to consider selling Louisiana to the United States. Acquisition of Louisiana was a long-term goal of President Thomas Jefferson, who was especially eager to gain control of the crucial Mississippi River port of New Orleans. Jefferson tasked James Monroe and Robert R. Livingston with purchasing New Orleans. Negotiating with French Treasury Minister Fran\u00e7ois Barb\u00e9-Marbois (who was acting on behalf of Napoleon), the American representatives quickly agreed to purchase the entire territory of Louisiana after it was offered. Overcoming the opposition of the Federalist Party, Jefferson and Secretary of State James Madison convinced Congress to ratify and fund the Louisiana Purchase.\nThe Louisiana Purchase extended United States sovereignty across the Mississippi River, nearly doubling the nominal size of the country. The purchase included land from fifteen present U.S. states and two Canadian provinces, including the entirety of Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska; large portions of North Dakota and South Dakota; the area of Montana, Wyoming, and Colorado east of the Continental Divide; the portion of Minnesota west of the Mississippi River; the northeastern section of New Mexico; northern portions of Texas; New Orleans and the portions of the present state of Louisiana west of the Mississippi River; and small portions of land within the present Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. At the time of the purchase, the territory of Louisiana's non-native population was around 60,000 inhabitants, of whom half were African slaves. The western borders of the purchase were later settled by the 1819 Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty with Spain, while the northern borders of the purchase were adjusted by the Treaty of 1818 with Britain.\n\n","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.397","Lupus","","Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), also known simply as lupus, is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in many parts of the body. Symptoms vary between people and may be mild to severe. Common symptoms include painful and swollen joints, fever, chest pain, hair loss, mouth ulcers, swollen lymph nodes, feeling tired, and a red rash which is most commonly on the face. Often there are periods of illness, called flares, and periods of remission during which there are few symptoms.The cause of SLE is not clear. It is thought to involve genetics together with environmental factors. Among identical twins, if one is affected there is a 24% chance the other one will be as well. Female sex hormones, sunlight, smoking, vitamin D deficiency, and certain infections, are also believed to increase the risk. The mechanism involves an immune response by autoantibodies against a person's own tissues. These are most commonly anti-nuclear antibodies and they result in inflammation. Diagnosis can be difficult and is based on a combination of symptoms and laboratory tests. There are a number of other kinds of lupus erythematosus including discoid lupus erythematosus, neonatal lupus, and subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus.There is no cure for SLE. Treatments may include NSAIDs, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, hydroxychloroquine, and methotrexate. Although corticosteroids are rapidly effective, long term use results in side effects. Alternative medicine has not been shown to affect the disease. Life expectancy is lower among people with SLE. SLE significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular disease with this being the most common cause of death. With modern treatment about 80% of those affected survive more than 15 years. Women with lupus have pregnancies that are higher risk but are mostly successful.Rate of SLE varies between countries from 20 to 70 per 100,000. Women of childbearing age are affected about nine times more often than men. While it most commonly begins between the ages of 15 and 45, a wide range of ages can be affected. Those of African, Caribbean, and Chinese descent are at higher risk than white people. Rates of disease in the developing world are unclear. Lupus is Latin for ""wolf"": the disease was so-named in the 13th century as the rash was thought to appear like a wolf's bite.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.398","Lutheranism","","Lutheranism is one of the largest branches of Protestantism that identifies with the teachings of Martin Luther, a 16th-century German reformer. Luther's efforts to reform the theology and practice of the church launched the Protestant Reformation. The reaction of the government and church authorities to the international spread of his writings, beginning with the 95 Theses, divided Western Christianity.The split between the Lutherans and the Catholics was made public and clear with the 1521 Edict of Worms: the edicts of the Diet condemned Luther and officially banned citizens of the Holy Roman Empire from defending or propagating his ideas, subjecting advocates of Lutheranism to forfeiture of all property, half of the seized property to be forfeit to the imperial government and the remaining half forfeit to the party who brought the accusation.The divide centered primarily on two points: the proper source of authority in the church, often called the formal principle of the Reformation, and the doctrine of justification, often called the material principle of Lutheran theology. Lutheranism advocates a doctrine of justification ""by grace alone through faith alone on the basis of Scripture alone"", the doctrine that scripture is the final authority on all matters of faith. This is in contrast to the belief of the Roman Catholic Church, defined at the Council of Trent, concerning authority coming from both the Scriptures and Tradition.Unlike Calvinism, Lutherans retain many of the liturgical practices and sacramental teachings of the pre-Reformation Church, with a particular emphasis on the Eucharist, or Lord's Supper. Lutheran theology differs from Reformed theology in Christology, divine grace, the purpose of God's Law, the concept of perseverance of the saints, and predestination.","wikipedia","5.1"

The organization is claimed to be the code name of an alleged secret committee of scientists, military leaders, and government officials, formed in 1947 by an executive order by U.S. President Harry S. Truman to facilitate recovery and investigation of alien spacecraft. The concept originated in a series of supposedly leaked secret government documents first circulated by ufologists in 1984. Upon examination, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) declared the documents to be ""completely bogus"", and many ufologists consider them to be an elaborate hoax.

"3.404","Makkah","","Mecca, also spelled Makkah, is a city in the Hejazi region of Saudi Arabia. The city is located 70 km (43 mi) inland from Jeddah, in a narrow valley 277 m (909 ft) above sea level, 340 kilometres (210 mi) south of Medina, its population in 2012 was 2 million, although visitors more than triple this number every year during the \u1e24ajj (""Pilgrimage""), held in the twelfth Muslim lunar month of Dh\u016bl-\u1e24ijjah.\nIt is the birthplace of Muhammad. A cave 3 km (2 mi) from Mecca was the site of Muhammad's first revelation of the Quran, and a pilgrimage to it, known as the Hajj, is obligatory for all able Muslims. Mecca is home to the Kaaba, one of Islam's holiest sites and the direction of Muslim prayer, and thus Mecca is regarded as the holiest city in Islam.Mecca was long ruled by Muhammad\u2019s descendants, the sharifs, acting either as independent rulers or as vassals to larger polities. It was conquered by Ibn Saud in 1925; since then Mecca has seen a tremendous expansion in size and infrastructure, such as the Abraj Al Bait, also known as the Makkah Royal Clock Tower Hotel, the world's fourth tallest building and the building with the third largest amount of floor area, and lost some historical structures and archaeological sites, such as the Ajyad Fortress.

"3.405","Maoism","","Maoism, or Mao Zedong Thought (Chinese: \u6bdb\u6cfd\u4e1c\u601d\u60f3; pinyin: M\u00e1o Z\u00e9d\u014dng s\u012bxi\u01ceng), is a variety of Marxism\u2013Leninism that Mao Zedong developed for realising a socialist revolution in the agricultural, pre-industrial society of the Republic of China and later the People's Republic of China. The philosophical difference between Maoism and Marxism\u2013Leninism is that the peasantry are the revolutionary vanguard in pre-industrial societies rather than the proletariat. This updating and adaptation of Marxism\u2013Leninism to Chinese conditions in which revolutionary praxis is primary and ideological orthodoxy is secondary represents urban Marxism\u2013Leninism adapted to pre-industrial China. The claim that Mao Zedong had adapted Marxism\u2013Leninism to Chinese conditions evolved into the idea that he had updated it in a fundamental way applying to the world as a whole.From the 1950s until the Chinese economic reforms of Deng Xiaoping in the late 1970s, Maoism was the political and military ideology of the Communist Party of China and of Maoist revolutionary movements throughout the world. After the Sino-Soviet split of the 1960s, the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union claimed to be the sole heir and successor to Joseph Stalin concerning the correct interpretation of Marxism\u2013Leninism and ideological leader of world communism.In the late 1970s, the Peruvian communist party Shining Path developed and synthesized Maoism into Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism, a contemporary variety of Marxism\u2013Leninism that is a supposed higher level of Marxism\u2013Leninism that can be applied universally.","wikipedia","5.6"

Cannabis can be used by smoking, vaporizing, within food, or as an extract.Cannabis has mental and physical effects. It causes a high, or stoned, feeling and other effects including a general change in perception, difficulty thinking, impaired short-term memory, altered sense of time, impaired body movement, relaxation, and an increase in appetite. At high doses, mental effects include psychosis, delusions, hallucinations, paranoia, and ideas of reference, sometimes with anxiety and panic. Its physical effects include increased heart rate, difficulty breathing, nausea, and behavioral problems in children whose mothers used cannabis during pregnancy. Short-term side effects may include dry mouth, red eyes, and feelings of paranoia or anxiety. Long-term adverse effects may include addiction, decreased mental ability in those who started regular use as adolescents, chronic coughing, and susceptibility to respiratory infections. There is a strong relation between cannabis use and the risk of psychosis, though the cause-and-effect is debated. Onset of effects is felt within minutes when smoked, and about 30 to 60 minutes when cooked and eaten. The effects last for two to six hours.Cannabis is mostly used for recreation or as a medicinal drug, although it may also be used for spiritual purposes. In 2013, between 128 and 232 million people used cannabis (2.7% to 4.9% of the global population between the ages of 15 and 65). It is the most commonly used illegal drug both in the world and the United States, though it is also legal in some jurisdictions. The countries with the highest use among adults as of 2018 are Zambia, the United States, Canada, and Nigeria. In 2016, 51% of people in the United States had used cannabis in their lifetimes. About 12% had used it in the past year, and 7.3% had used it in the past month.While cannabis plants have been grown since at least the 3rd millennium BCE, evidence suggests it was being smoked for psychoactive effects at least 2,500 years ago in the Pamir Mountains. Since the early 20th century, cannabis has been subject to legal restrictions. The possession, use, and cultivation of cannabis is illegal in most countries of the world. In 2013, Uruguay became the first country to legalize recreational use of cannabis. Other countries to do so are Canada, Georgia, and South Africa, plus 11 states and the District of Columbia in the United States (though the drug remains federally illegal). Medical use of cannabis, requiring the approval of a physician, has been legalized in a greater number of countries.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.407","Masculism","","Masculism or masculinism may variously refer to advocacy of the rights or needs of men and boys; and the adherence to or promotion of attributes (opinions, values, attitudes, habits) regarded as typical of men and boys. The terms may also refer to the men's rights or men's movement.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.408","Master race","","The master race (German: Herrenrasse, also referred to as Herrenvolk  ""master people"") is a concept in Nazi ideology in which the putative Nordic or Aryan races, predominant among Germans and other northern European peoples, are deemed the highest in racial hierarchy. Members of this alleged master race were referred to as Herrenmenschen (""master humans"").\nThe Nazi theorist Alfred Rosenberg believed that the Nordic race was descended from Proto-Aryans, who he believed had prehistorically dwelt on the North German Plain and ultimately originated on the lost continent of Atlantis. The Nazis declared that the Nordics (now referred to as the Germanic peoples), or Aryans as they sometimes called them, were superior to all other races. The Nazis believed they were entitled to expand territorially. This concept is known as Nordicism. The actual policy that was implemented by the Nazis resulted in the Aryan certificate. This document, which was required by law for all citizens of the Reich was the ""Lesser Aryan certificate"" (Kleiner Ariernachweis). This could be obtained through an Ahnenpass, which required the owner to trace her or his lineage through baptism, birth certificates or certified proof thereof that all grandparents were of ""Aryan descent"".\nThe Slavs (along with Gypsies and Jews) were defined as being racially inferior and non-Aryan Untermenschen, and were thus considered to be a danger to the ""Aryan"" or Germanic master race. According to the Nazi secret Hunger Plan and Generalplan Ost, the Slavic population was to be removed from Central Europe through expulsion, enslavement, starvation, and extermination, except for a small percentage who were deemed to be non-Slavic descendants of Germanic settlers, and thus suitable for Germanisation.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.409","Masturbation","","Masturbation is the sexual stimulation of one's own genitals for sexual arousal or other sexual pleasure, usually to the point of orgasm. The stimulation may involve hands, fingers, everyday objects, sex toys such as vibrators, or combinations of these. Mutual masturbation is masturbation with a sexual partner, and may include manual stimulation of a partner's genitals (fingering or a handjob), or be used as a form of non-penetrative sex.Masturbation is frequent in both sexes and at any age. Various medical and psychological benefits have been attributed to a healthy attitude toward sexual activity in general and to masturbation in particular. No causal relationship is known between masturbation and any form of mental or physical disorder. In the Western world, masturbation in private or with a partner is generally considered a normal and healthy part of sexual enjoyment.\nMasturbation has been depicted in art since prehistoric times, and is both mentioned and discussed in very early writings. In the 18th and 19th centuries, some European theologians and physicians described it as ""heinous"", ""deplorable"", and ""hideous"", but during the 20th century these taboos generally declined. There has been an increase in discussion and portrayal of masturbation in art, popular music, television, films, and literature. Today, religions vary in their views of masturbation; some view it as a spiritually detrimental practice, some see it as not spiritually detrimental, and others take a situational view. The legal status of masturbation has also varied through history and masturbation in public is illegal in most countries. Animal masturbation has been observed in many species, both in the wild and in captivity.","wikipedia","5.7"
"3.410","Meaning of life","","The meaning of life, or the answer to the question: ""What is the meaning of life?"", pertains to the significance of living or existence in general. Many other related questions include: ""Why are we here?"", ""What is life all about?"", or ""What is the purpose of existence?"" There have been many proposed answers to these questions from many different cultural and ideological backgrounds. The search for life's meaning has produced much philosophical, scientific, theological, and metaphysical speculation throughout history. Different people and cultures believe different things for the answer to this question.\nThe meaning of life as we perceive it is derived from philosophical and religious contemplation of, and scientific inquiries about existence, social ties, consciousness, and happiness.  Many other issues are also involved, such as symbolic meaning, ontology, value, purpose, ethics, good and evil, free will, the existence of one or multiple gods, conceptions of God, the soul, and the afterlife. Scientific contributions focus primarily on describing related empirical facts about the universe, exploring the context and parameters concerning the ""how"" of life. Science also studies and can provide recommendations for the pursuit of well-being and a related conception of morality. An alternative, humanistic approach poses the question, ""What is the meaning of my life?""","wikipedia","5.2"
"3.411","Media bias","","Media bias is the bias or perceived bias of journalists and news producers within the mass media in the selection of many events and stories that are reported and how they are covered.  The term ""media bias"" implies a pervasive or widespread bias contravening the standards of journalism, rather than the perspective of an individual journalist or article. The direction and degree of media bias in various countries is widely disputed.Practical limitations to media neutrality include the inability of journalists to report all available stories and facts, and the requirement that selected facts be linked into a coherent narrative. Government influence, including overt and covert censorship, biases the media in some countries, for example China, North Korea and Myanmar.  Market forces that result in a biased presentation include the ownership of the news source, concentration of media ownership, the selection of staff, the preferences of an intended audience,\nThere are a number of national and international watchdog groups that report on bias in the media.","wikipedia","5.13"
"3.412","Medical torture","","Medical torture describes the involvement of, or sometimes instigation by, medical personnel in acts of torture, either to judge what victims can endure, to apply treatments which will enhance torture, or as torturers in their own right. Medical torture overlaps with medical interrogation if it involves the use of professional medical expertise to facilitate interrogation or corporal punishment, in the conduct of torturous human experimentation or in providing professional medical sanction and approval for the torture of prisoners. Medical torture also covers torturous scientific (or pseudo-scientific) experimentation upon unwilling human subjects.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.413","Menachem Mendel Schneerson","","Menachem Mendel Schneerson (Hebrew: \u05de\u05e0\u05d7\u05dd \u05de\u05e0\u05d3\u05dc \u05e9\u05e0\u05d9\u05d0\u05d5\u05e8\u05e1\u05d5\u05df\u200e; Yiddish: \u05de\u05e0\u05d7\u05dd \u05de\u05e2\u05e0\u05d3\u05dc \u05e9\u05e0\u05d9\u05d0\u05d5\u05e8\u05e1\u05d0\u05d4\u05df\u200e; April 5, 1902 OS \u2013 June 12, 1994; AM 11 Nissan 5662 \u2013 3 Tammuz 5754), known to many as the Lubavitcher Rebbe or simply as the Rebbe, was a Russian Empire-born American Orthodox Jewish rabbi, and the most recent rebbe of the Lubavitcher Hasidic dynasty. He is considered one of the most influential Jewish leaders of the 20th century.As leader of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement, he took an insular Hasidic group that almost came to an end with the Holocaust and transformed it into one of the most influential movements in religious world Jewry, with an international network of over 3,000 educational and social centers. The institutions he established include kindergartens, schools, drug-rehabilitation centers, care-homes for the disabled and synagogues.Schneerson was known for his intelligence and strong memory. Many testimonies attribute the performance of miracles to Schneerson. Schneerson's published teachings fill more than 300 volumes, and he is noted for his contributions to Jewish continuity and religious thought, as well as his wide-ranging contributions to traditional Torah scholarship. He is recognized as the pioneer of Jewish outreach. During his lifetime, many of his adherents believed that he was the Messiah. Schneerson's own attitude to this subject and whether he explicitly encouraged this belief are debated among his followers and researchers alike. Many followers refused to accept the fact of his death after 1994. Since his death, Chabad has been torn between ""Messianics"" who openly declare he is alive, and ""antis"", who accept the fact of his death. A very small group within Chabad claims that Schneerson is not merely the Messiah but divine as well, ""God and above God"".In 1978, the U.S. Congress asked President Jimmy Carter to designate Schneerson's birthday as the national Education Day U.S.A. It has been since commemorated as Education and Sharing Day. In 1994, he was posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for his ""outstanding and lasting contributions toward improvements in world education, morality, and acts of charity."" Schneerson's resting place attracts Jews and non-Jews for prayer.","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.414","Mennonite","","The Mennonites are members of certain Christian groups belonging to the church communities of Anabaptist denominations named after Menno Simons (1496\u20131561) of Friesland (which today is a province of the Netherlands). Through his writings, Simons articulated and formalized the teachings of earlier Swiss founders. The early teachings of the Mennonites were founded on the belief in both the mission and ministry of Jesus, which the original Anabaptist followers held to with great conviction despite persecution by the various Roman Catholic and Protestant states. An early set of Mennonite beliefs was codified in the Dordrecht Confession of Faith in 1632, but the various groups do not hold to a common confession or creed. Rather than fight, the majority of these followers survived by fleeing to neighboring states where ruling families were tolerant of their belief in believer's baptism. Over the years, Mennonites have become known as one of the historic peace churches because of their commitment to pacifism.In contemporary 21st-century society, Mennonites either are described only as a religious denomination with members of different ethnic origins or as both an ethnic group and a religious denomination. There is controversy among Mennonites about this issue, with some insisting that they are simply a religious group while others argue that they form a distinct ethnic group. Historians and sociologists have increasingly started to treat Mennonites as an ethno-religious group, while others have begun to challenge that perception. There is also a discussion about the term ""ethnic Mennonite"". Conservative Mennonite groups, who speak Pennsylvania German, Plautdietsch (Low German), or Bernese German fit well into the definition of an ethnic group, while more liberal groups and converts in developing countries do not.\nThere are about 2.1 million Anabaptists worldwide as of 2015 (including Mennonites, Amish, Mennonite Brethren, Hutterites and many other Anabaptist groups formally part of the Mennonite World Conference). Mennonite congregations worldwide embody the full scope of Mennonite practice from ""plain people"" to those who are indistinguishable in dress and appearance from the general population. Mennonites can be found in communities in 87 countries on six continents. The largest populations of Mennonites are in Canada, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, India, and the United States. There are Mennonite colonies in Argentina, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Mexico, Uruguay, and Paraguay. Today, fewer than 500 Mennonites remain in Ukraine. A relatively small Mennonite presence, known as the Algemene Doopsgezinde Societeit, still continues in the Netherlands, where Simons was born.\n\n","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.415","Menopause","","Menopause, also known as the climacteric, is the time in most women's lives when menstrual periods stop permanently, and they are no longer able to bear children. Menopause typically occurs between 49 and 52 years of age. Medical professionals often define menopause as having occurred when a woman has not had any vaginal bleeding for a year. It may also be defined by a decrease in hormone production by the ovaries. In those who have had surgery to remove their uterus but still have ovaries, menopause may be considered to have occurred at the time of the surgery or when their hormone levels fell. Following the removal of the uterus, symptoms typically occur earlier, at an average of 45 years of age.In the years before menopause, a woman's periods typically become irregular, which means that periods may be longer or shorter in duration or be lighter or heavier in the amount of flow. During this time, women often experience hot flashes; these typically last from 30 seconds to ten minutes and may be associated with shivering, sweating, and reddening of the skin. Hot flashes often stop occurring after a year or two. Other symptoms may include vaginal dryness, trouble sleeping, and mood changes. The severity of symptoms varies between women. While menopause is often thought to be linked to an increase in heart disease, this primarily occurs due to increasing age and does not have a direct relationship with menopause. In some women, problems that were present like endometriosis or painful periods will improve after menopause.Menopause is usually a natural change. It can occur earlier in those who smoke tobacco. Other causes include surgery that removes both ovaries or some types of chemotherapy. At the physiological level, menopause happens because of a decrease in the ovaries' production of the hormones estrogen and progesterone. While typically not needed, a diagnosis of menopause can be confirmed by measuring hormone levels in the blood or urine. Menopause is the opposite of menarche, the time when a girl's periods start.Specific treatment is not usually needed. Some symptoms, however, may be improved with treatment. With respect to hot flashes, avoiding smoking, caffeine, and alcohol is often recommended. Sleeping in a cool room and using a fan may help. The following medications may help: menopausal hormone therapy (MHT), clonidine, gabapentin, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Exercise may help with sleeping problems. While MHT was once routinely prescribed, it is now only recommended in those with significant symptoms, as there are concerns about side effects. High-quality evidence for the effectiveness of alternative medicine has not been found. There is tentative evidence for phytoestrogens.\n\n","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.416","Mental disorder","","A mental disorder, also called a mental illness or psychiatric disorder, is a behavioral or mental pattern that causes significant distress or impairment of personal functioning. Such features may be persistent, relapsing and remitting, or occur as a single episode. Many disorders have been described, with signs and symptoms that vary widely between specific disorders. Such disorders may be diagnosed by a mental health professional.\nThe causes of mental disorders are often unclear. Theories may incorporate findings from a range of fields. Mental disorders are usually defined by a combination of how a person behaves, feels, perceives, or thinks. This may be associated with particular regions or functions of the brain, often in a social context. A mental disorder is one aspect of mental health. Cultural and religious beliefs, as well as social norms, should be taken into account when making a diagnosis.Services are based in psychiatric hospitals or in the community, and assessments are carried out by mental health professionals such as psychiatrists, psychologists, and clinical social workers, using various methods such as psychometric tests but often relying on observation and questioning. Treatments are provided by various mental health professionals. Psychotherapy and psychiatric medication are two major treatment options. Other treatments include lifestyle changes, social interventions, peer support, and self-help. In a minority of cases, there might be involuntary detention or treatment. Prevention programs have been shown to reduce depression.Common mental disorders include depression, which affects about 300 million, bipolar disorder, which affects about 60 million, dementia, which affects about 50 million, and schizophrenia and other psychoses, which affects about 23 million people globally. Stigma and discrimination can add to the suffering and disability associated with mental disorders, leading to various social movements attempting to increase understanding and challenge social exclusion.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.417","Mental retardation","","Intellectual disability (ID), also known as general learning disability and  mental retardation (MR), is a generalized neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by significantly impaired intellectual and adaptive functioning. It is defined by an IQ under 70, in addition to deficits in two or more adaptive behaviors that affect everyday, general living.\nOnce focused almost entirely on cognition, the definition now includes both a component relating to mental functioning and one relating to an individual's functional skills in their daily environment. As a result of this focus on the person's abilities in practice, a person with an unusually low IQ may still not be considered to have intellectual disability.\nIntellectual disability is subdivided into syndromic intellectual disability, in which intellectual deficits associated with other medical and behavioral signs and symptoms are present, and non-syndromic intellectual disability, in which intellectual deficits appear without other abnormalities. Down syndrome and fragile X syndrome are examples of syndromic intellectual disabilities.\nIntellectual disability affects about 2\u20133% of the general population. Seventy-five to ninety percent of the affected people have mild intellectual disability. Non-syndromic, or idiopathic cases account for 30\u201350% of these cases. About a quarter of cases are caused by a genetic disorder, and about 5% of cases are inherited from a person's parents. Cases of unknown cause affect about 95 million people as of 2013.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.418","Mercury poisoning","","Mercury poisoning is a type of metal poisoning due to exposure to mercury. Symptoms depend upon the type, dose, method, and duration of exposure. They may include muscle weakness, poor coordination, numbness in the hands and feet, skin rashes, anxiety, memory problems, trouble speaking, trouble hearing, or trouble seeing. High-level exposure to methylmercury is known as Minamata disease. Methylmercury exposure in children may result in acrodynia (pink disease) in which the skin becomes pink and peels. Long-term complications may include kidney problems and decreased intelligence. The effects of long-term low-dose exposure to methylmercury are unclear.Forms of mercury exposure include metal, vapor, salt, and organic compound. Most exposure is from eating fish, amalgam based dental fillings, or exposure at work. In fish, those higher up in the food chain generally have higher levels of mercury. Less commonly, poisoning may occur as a method of attempted suicide. Human activities that release mercury into the environment include the burning of coal and mining of gold. Tests of the blood, urine, and hair for mercury are available but do not relate well to the amount in the body.Prevention includes eating a diet low in mercury, removing mercury from medical and other devices, proper disposal of mercury, and not mining further mercury. In those with acute poisoning from inorganic mercury salts, chelation with either dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) or dimercaptopropane sulfonate (DMPS) appears to improve outcomes if given within a few hours of exposure. Chelation for those with long-term exposure is of unclear benefit. In certain communities that survive on fishing, rates of mercury poisoning among children have been as high as 1.7 per 100.","wikipedia","5.9"

It followed in the wake of the 1845 U.S. annexation of Texas, which was not formally recognized by the Mexican government, who disputed the Treaties of Velasco signed by Mexican caudillo President/General Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna after the Texas Revolution a decade earlier. In 1845, newly elected U.S. President James K. Polk, who saw the annexation of Texas as the first step towards a further expansion of the United States, sent troops to the disputed area and a diplomatic mission to Mexico. After Mexican forces attacked U.S. forces, the United States Congress declared war.\nU.S. forces quickly occupied the regional capital of Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico along the upper Rio Grande and the Pacific coast province of Alta California, and then moved south. Meanwhile, the Pacific Squadron of the U.S. Navy blockaded the Pacific coast farther south in the lower Baja California Territory. The U.S. Army, under Major General Winfield Scott, eventually captured Mexico City through stiff resistance, having marched west from the port of Veracruz on the Gulf Coast, where the U.S. staged its first ever major amphibious landing.\nThe 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, forced onto the remnant Mexican government, ended the war and enforced the Mexican Cession of the northern territories of Alta California and Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico to the United States. The U.S. agreed to pay $15 million in compensation for the physical damage of the war and assumed $3.25 million of debt already owed earlier by the Mexican government to U.S. citizens. Mexico acknowledged the loss of what became the State of Texas and accepted the Rio Grande as its northern border with the United States.\nThe victory and territorial expansion Polk envisioned inspired great patriotism in the United States, but the war and treaty drew some criticism in the U.S. for their casualties, monetary cost, and heavy-handedness, particularly early on. The question of how to treat the new acquisitions also intensified the debate over slavery. Mexico's worsened domestic turmoil and losses of life, territory and national prestige left it in what prominent Mexicans called a ""state of degradation and ruin"".","wikipedia","5.6"

"3.421","Middle Ages","","In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages (or medieval period) lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages.\nPopulation decline, counterurbanisation, collapse of centralized authority, invasions, and mass migrations of tribes, which had begun in Late Antiquity, continued in the Early Middle Ages. The large-scale movements of the Migration Period, including various Germanic peoples, formed new kingdoms in what remained of the Western Roman Empire. In the 7th century, North Africa and the Middle East\u2014once part of the Byzantine Empire\u2014came under the rule of the Umayyad Caliphate, an Islamic empire, after conquest by Muhammad's successors.  Although there were substantial changes in society and political structures, the break with classical antiquity was not complete. The still-sizeable Byzantine Empire, Rome's direct continuation, survived in the Eastern Mediterranean and remained a major power. The empire's law code, the Corpus Juris Civilis or ""Code of Justinian"", was rediscovered in Northern Italy in 1070 and became widely admired later in the Middle Ages.  In the West, most kingdoms incorporated the few extant Roman institutions. Monasteries were founded as campaigns to Christianise pagan Europe continued. The Franks, under the Carolingian dynasty, briefly established the Carolingian Empire during the later 8th and early 9th centuries. It covered much of Western Europe but later succumbed to the pressures of internal civil wars combined with external invasions: Vikings from the north, Magyars from the east, and Saracens from the south.\nDuring the High Middle Ages, which began after 1000, the population of Europe increased greatly as technological and agricultural innovations allowed trade to flourish and the Medieval Warm Period climate change allowed crop yields to increase. Manorialism, the organisation of peasants into villages that owed rent and labour services to the nobles, and feudalism, the political structure whereby knights and lower-status nobles owed military service to their overlords in return for the right to rent from lands and manors, were two of the ways society was organised in the High Middle Ages. The Crusades, first preached in 1095, were military attempts by Western European Christians to regain control of the Holy Land from Muslims. Kings became the heads of centralised nation-states, reducing crime and violence but making the ideal of a unified Christendom more distant. Intellectual life was marked by scholasticism, a philosophy that emphasised joining faith to reason, and by the founding of universities. The theology of Thomas Aquinas, the paintings of Giotto, the poetry of Dante and Chaucer, the travels of Marco Polo, and the Gothic architecture of cathedrals such as Chartres are among the outstanding achievements toward the end of this period and into the Late Middle Ages.\nThe Late Middle Ages was marked by difficulties and calamities including famine, plague, and war, which significantly diminished the population of Europe; between 1347 and 1350, the Black Death killed about a third of Europeans. Controversy, heresy, and the Western Schism within the Catholic Church paralleled the interstate conflict, civil strife, and peasant revolts that occurred in the kingdoms. Cultural and technological developments transformed European society, concluding the Late Middle Ages and beginning the early modern period.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.422","Mind control","","Brainwashing (also known as mind control, menticide, coercive persuasion,  thought control, thought reform, and re-education) is the concept that the human mind can be altered or controlled by certain psychological techniques. Brainwashing is said to reduce its subjects' ability to think critically or independently, to allow the introduction of new, unwanted thoughts and ideas into their minds, as well as to change their attitudes, values and beliefs.The term ""brainwashing"" was first used by Edward Hunter in 1950 to describe how the Chinese government appeared to make people cooperate with them. Research into the concept also looked at Nazi Germany, at some criminal cases in the United States, and at the actions of human traffickers. In the 1970s there was considerable scientific and legal debate, as well as media attention, about the possibility of brainwashing being a factor in the conversion of young people to some new religious movements, which were often referred to as cults at the time.  The concept of brainwashing is sometimes involved in lawsuits, especially regarding child custody, and is also a theme in science fiction and in criticism of modern political and  corporate culture. \nAlthough the term ""brainwashing"" appears in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) of the American Psychiatric Association it is not generally accepted as  scientific term.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.423","Mining","","Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth, usually from an ore body, lode, vein, seam, reef or placer deposit. These deposits form a mineralized package that is of economic interest to the miner.\nOres recovered by mining include metals, coal, oil shale, gemstones, limestone, chalk, dimension stone, rock salt, potash, gravel, and clay. Mining is required to obtain any material that cannot be grown through agricultural processes, or feasibly created artificially in a laboratory or factory. Mining in a wider sense includes extraction of any non-renewable resource such as petroleum, natural gas, or even water.\nMining of stones and metal has been a human activity since pre-historic times. Modern mining processes involve prospecting for ore bodies, analysis of the profit potential of a proposed mine, extraction of the desired materials, and final reclamation of the land after the mine is closed.Mining operations usually create a negative environmental impact, both during the mining activity and after the mine has closed. Hence, most of the world's nations have passed regulations to decrease the impact. Work safety has long been a concern as well, and modern practices have significantly improved safety in mines.\nLevels of metal recycling are generally low. Unless future end-of-life recycling rates are stepped up, some rare metals may become unavailable for use in a variety of consumer products. Due to the low recycling rates, some landfills now contain higher concentrations of metal than mines themselves.","wikipedia","5.9"
"3.424","Minor (law)","","In law, a minor is a person under a certain age, usually the age of majority, which legally demarcates childhood from adulthood. The age of majority depends upon jurisdiction and application, but it is generally 18. Minor may also be used in contexts that are unconnected to the overall age of majority. For example, the drinking age in the United States is usually 21, and younger people are sometimes called minors in the context of alcohol law, even if they are at least 18. The term underage often refers to those under the age of majority, but it may also refer to persons under a certain age limit, such as the drinking age, smoking age, age of consent, marriageable age, driving age, voting age, etc. Such age limits are often different from the age of majority. \nThe concept of minor is not sharply defined in most jurisdictions. The age of criminal responsibility and consent, the age at which school attendance is no longer compulsory, the age at which legally binding contracts can be entered into, and so on may be different from one another.\nIn many countries, including Australia, India, Brazil, Croatia, and Colombia, a minor is defined as a person under the age of 18. In the United States, where the age of majority is set by the individual states, minor usually refers to someone under the age of 18 but can, in some states, be used in certain areas (such as casino gambling, handgun ownership and the consuming of alcohol) to define someone under the age of 21. In the criminal justice system in some places, ""minor"" is not entirely consistent, as a minor may be tried and punished for a crime either as a ""juvenile"" or, usually only for ""extremely serious crimes"" such as murder and/or theft, as an ""adult"".\nIn Japan, Taiwan, and Thailand, a minor is a person under 20 years of age. In New Zealand law, the age of majority is 20 years of age as well, but most of the rights of adulthood are assumed at lower ages: for example, entering contracts and having a will are allowed at 15.","wikipedia","5.0"
"3.425","Modernism","","Modernism is both a philosophical movement and an art movement that, along with cultural trends and changes, arose from wide-scale and far-reaching transformations in Western society during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Among the factors that shaped modernism were the development of modern industrial societies and the rapid growth of cities, followed then by reactions to the horrors of World War I. Modernism also rejected the certainty of Enlightenment thinking, although many modernists also rejected religious belief.Modernism, in general, includes the activities and creations of those who felt the traditional forms of art, architecture, literature, religious faith, philosophy, social organization, activities of daily life, and sciences were becoming ill-fitted to their tasks and outdated in the new economic, social, and political environment of an emerging fully industrialized world. The poet Ezra Pound's 1934 injunction to ""Make it new!"" was the touchstone of the movement's approach towards what it saw as the now obsolete culture of the past. In this spirit, its innovations, like the stream-of-consciousness novel, atonal (or pantonal) and twelve-tone music, divisionist painting and abstract art, all had precursors in the 19th century.\nA notable characteristic of modernism is self-consciousness and irony concerning literary and social traditions, which often led to experiments with form, along with the use of techniques that drew attention to the processes and materials used in creating a painting, poem, building and other works of art. Modernism explicitly rejected the ideology of realism and made use of the works of the past by the employment of reprise, incorporation, rewriting, recapitulation, revision and parody.While some scholars see modernism continuing into the 21st century, others see it evolving into late modernism or high modernism. Postmodernism is a departure from modernism and refutes its basic assumptions.\n\n","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.426","Moldavia","","Moldavia (Romanian: Moldova, pronounced [mol\u02c8dova] (listen) or \u021aara Moldovei (in Romanian Latin alphabet), literally The Moldavian Country; in old Romanian Cyrillic alphabet: \u0426\u0430\u0440\u0430 \u041c\u0461\u043b\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0454\u0439) is a historical region and former principality in Central and Eastern Europe, corresponding to the territory between the Eastern Carpathians and the Dniester River. An initially independent and later autonomous state, it existed from the 14th century to 1859, when it united with Wallachia (\u021aara Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103) as the basis of the modern Romanian state; at various times, Moldavia included the regions of Bessarabia (with the Budjak), all of Bukovina and Hertza.

"3.427","Morality","","Morality (from Latin: moralitas, lit. 'manner, character, proper behavior') is the differentiation of intentions, decisions and actions between those that are distinguished as proper and those that are improper. Morality can be a body of standards or principles derived from a code of conduct from a particular philosophy, religion or culture, or it can derive from a standard that a person believes should be universal. Morality may also be specifically synonymous with ""goodness"" or ""rightness"".\nMoral philosophy includes meta-ethics, which studies abstract issues such as moral ontology and moral epistemology, and normative ethics, which studies more concrete systems of moral decision-making such as deontological ethics and consequentialism. An example of normative ethical philosophy is the Golden Rule, which states that: ""One should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself.""Immorality is the active opposition to morality (i.e. opposition to that which is good or right), while amorality is variously defined as an unawareness of, indifference toward, or disbelief in any particular set of moral standards or principles.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.428","Mormonism","","Mormonism is the predominant religious tradition of the Latter Day Saint movement of Restorationist Christianity started by Joseph Smith in Western New York in the 1820s and 30s.\nThe word Mormon originally derived from the Book of Mormon, a religious text published by Smith, which he said he translated from golden plates with divine assistance. The book describes itself as a chronicle of early indigenous peoples of the Americas and their dealings with God. Based on the book's name, Smith's early followers were more widely known as Mormons, and their faith Mormonism. The term was initially considered pejorative, but Mormons no longer consider it so (although generally preferring other terms such as Latter-day Saint or LDS).After Smith was killed in 1844, most Mormons followed Brigham Young on his westward journey to the area that became the Utah Territory, calling themselves The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Other sects include Mormon fundamentalism, which seeks to maintain practices and doctrines such as polygamy, and other small independent denominations. The second-largest Latter Day Saint denomination, the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, since 2001 called the Community of Christ, does not describe itself as ""Mormon"", but follows a Trinitarian Christian restorationist theology, and considers itself Restorationist in terms of Latter Day Saint doctrine.\nMormonism has common beliefs with the rest of the Latter Day Saint movement, including the use of and belief in the Bible, and in other religious texts including the Book of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants. It also accepts the Pearl of Great Price as part of its scriptural canon, and has a history of teaching eternal marriage, eternal progression and polygamy (plural marriage), although the LDS Church formally abandoned the practice of plural marriage in 1890. Cultural Mormonism, a lifestyle promoted by Mormon institutions, includes cultural Mormons who identify with the culture, but not necessarily the theology.","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.400","MPAA film rating system","","The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) film rating system is used in the United States and its territories to rate a film's suitability for certain audiences based on its content. The MPAA rating system is a voluntary scheme that is not enforced by law; films can be exhibited without a rating, although certain theaters refuse to exhibit non-rated or NC-17 rated films. Non-members of MPAA may also submit films for rating. Other media, such as television programs, music and video games, are rated by other entities such as the TV Parental Guidelines, the RIAA and the ESRB, respectively.\nIntroduced in 1968, the MPAA rating system is one of various motion picture rating systems that are used to help parents decide what films are appropriate for their children. It is administered by the Classification & Ratings Administration (CARA), an independent division of the MPAA.","wikipedia","5.12"

"3.429","Mucoid plaque","","Mucoid plaque (or mucoid cap or rope) is a pseudoscientific term used by some alternative medicine advocates to describe what is claimed to be a combination of harmful mucus-like material and food residue that they say coats the gastrointestinal tract of most people. The term was coined by Richard Anderson, a naturopath and entrepreneur, who sells a range of products that claim to ""cleanse"" the body of such purported plaques.Many such ""colon cleansing"" products are promoted to the public on websites that have been described as making misleading medical claims. The presence of laxatives, bentonite clay, and fibrous thickening agents in some of these ""cleansing agents"" has led to suggestions that the products themselves produce the excreted matter regarded as the plaque.\nThe concept of a 'mucoid plaque' has been dismissed by medical experts as having no anatomical or physiological basis.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.430","Multiculturalism","","The term multiculturalism has a range of meanings within the contexts of sociology, of political philosophy, and of colloquial use. In sociology and in everyday usage, it is a synonym for ""ethnic pluralism"", with the two terms often used interchangeably, for example, a cultural pluralism in which various ethnic groups collaborate and enter into a dialogue with one another without having to sacrifice their particular identities. It can describe a mixed ethnic community area where multiple cultural traditions exist (such as New York City) or a single country within which they do (such as Switzerland, Belgium or Russia). Groups associated with an indigenous or autochthonous ethnic group and foreigner ethnic groups are often the focus.\nIn reference to sociology, multiculturalism is the end-state of either a natural or artificial process (for example: legally-controlled immigration) and occurs on either a large national scale or on a smaller scale within a nation's communities. On a smaller scale this can occur artificially when a jurisdiction is established or expanded by amalgamating areas with two or more different cultures (e.g. French Canada and English Canada). On a large scale, it can occur as a result of either legal or illegal migration to and from different jurisdictions around the world (for example, Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain by Angles, Saxons and Jutes in the 5th century or the colonization of the Americas by Europeans, Africans and Asians since the 16th century). \nIn reference to political science, Multiculturalism can be defined as a states capacity to effectively and efficiently deal with cultural plurality within its sovereign borders. Multiculturalism as a political philosophy involves ideologies and policies which vary widely. It has been described as a ""salad bowl"" and as a ""cultural mosaic"", in contrast to a ""melting pot"".\n\n","wikipedia","['5.5','5.13']"

Al-Banna's teachings spread far beyond Egypt, influencing today various Islamist movements from charitable organizations to political parties\u2014not all using the same name.Initially, as a Pan-Islamic, religious, and social movement, it preached Islam in Egypt, taught the illiterate, and set up hospitals and business enterprises. It later advanced into the political arena, aiming to end British colonial control of Egypt. The movement's self-stated aim is the establishment of a state ruled by Sharia law\u2013its most famous slogan worldwide being: ""Islam is the solution"". Charity is a major propellant to its work.The group spread to other Muslim countries but has its largest, or one of its largest, organizations in Egypt despite a succession of government crackdowns starting in 1948 up until today, with accusations of planning assassinations and plots. It remained a fringe group in politics of the Arab World until the 1967 Six-Day War, when Islamism managed to replace popular secular Arab nationalism after a resounding Arab defeat by Israel. The movement was also supported by Saudi Arabia, with which it shared mutual enemies like communism.The Arab Spring brought it legalization and substantial political power at first, but as of 2013 it has suffered severe reversals. The Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood was legalized in 2011 and won several elections, including the 2012 presidential election when its candidate Mohamed Morsi became Egypt's first president to gain power through an election, though one year later, following massive demonstrations and unrest, he was overthrown by the military and placed under house arrest. The group was then banned in Egypt and declared as a terrorist organization. Persian Gulf monarchies of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates followed suit, driven by the perception that the Brotherhood is a threat to their authoritarian rule.The Brotherhood itself claims to be a peaceful, democratic organization, and that its leader ""condemns violence and violent acts"".\nToday, the primary state backers of the Muslim Brotherhood are Qatar and Turkey. As of 2015, it is considered a terrorist organization by the governments of Bahrain, Egypt, Russia, Syria, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.","wikipedia","5.5"

The series is based on Hasbro's My Little Pony line of toys and animated works and is often referred to by collectors as the fourth generation (""G4"") of the franchise. The series premiered on October 10, 2010, on The Hub cable channel (which was renamed as Discovery Family in late 2014), and ended on October 12, 2019. Hasbro selected animator Lauren Faust as the creative director and executive producer for the show. Faust sought to challenge the established nature of the existing My Little Pony line, creating more in-depth characters and adventurous settings; she left the series during season 2, to be replaced by Meghan McCarthy as showrunner for the remainder of the series.\nThe show follows a studious anthropomorphic unicorn (later an alicorn) pony named Twilight Sparkle as her mentor Princess Celestia guides her to learn about friendship in the town of Ponyville. Twilight and her dragon assistant Spike become close friends with five other ponies: Applejack, Rarity, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, and Pinkie Pie. Each of the ponies represent a different facet of friendship, and Twilight discovers herself to be a key part of the magical artifacts known as the ""Elements of Harmony"". The ponies travel on adventures and help others around Equestria while working out problems that arise in their own friendships.\nThe series has become a major commercial success, becoming the most highly rated original production in the Hub Network's broadcast history and leading to new merchandising opportunities for Hasbro, including books, clothing, collectible trading cards, and comics. Despite the target demographic of young girls, Friendship Is Magic has also gained a large following of older viewers, mainly young and middle-aged men, who call themselves ""bronies"". Portions of the show have become part of the remix culture, and have formed the basis for a variety of internet memes.\nA feature-length film adaptation directly based on the TV series, titled My Little Pony: The Movie, was theatrically released on October 6, 2017, in the United States. A spin-off franchise, My Little Pony: Equestria Girls, was launched in 2013.

"3.440","National-Anarchism","","National-anarchism is an anti-capitalist, anti-Marxist and radical right ideology. National-anarchists advocate a post-capitalist stateless society in which homogeneous communities of different ethnic or racial groups would be free to develop separately in their own tribal communes, named ""national autonomous zones"", that are politically meritocratic, economically mutualistic, ecologically sustainable, and socially and culturally traditional.Although the term ""national-anarchism"" dates back as far as the 1920s, the contemporary national-anarchist movement has been put forward since the late 1990s by British political activist Troy Southgate, who positions it as being ""beyond left and right"". The few scholars who have studied national-anarchism conclude that it represents a further evolution in the thinking of the radical right rather than an entirely new dimension on the political spectrum.National-anarchism has elicited skepticism and outright hostility from both left-wing and far-right critics. The former accuse national-anarchists of being nothing more than white nationalists who promote a communalist form of ethnic and racial separatism, while the latter argue they want the militant chic of calling themselves ""anarchists"" without the historical and philosophical baggage that accompanies such a claim.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.438","National Democratic Party of Germany","","The National Democratic Party of Germany (German: Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands or NPD) is an identitarian, far-right and ultranationalist political party in Germany.\nThe party was founded in 1964 as successor to the German Reich Party (German: Deutsche Reichspartei, DRP). Party statements also self-identify the party as Germany's ""only significant patriotic force"". On 1 January 2011, the nationalist German People's Union (German: Deutsche Volksunion) merged with the NPD and the party name of the National Democratic Party of Germany was extended by the addition of ""The People's Union"".The party is mostly described as a neo-Nazi organization and has been referred to as ""the most significant neo-Nazi party to emerge after 1945"". The German Federal Agency for Civic Education, or BPB, has criticized the NPD for working with members of organizations which were later found unconstitutional by the federal courts and disbanded, while the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (German: Bundesamt f\u00fcr Verfassungsschutz), Germany's domestic security agency, classifies the NPD as a ""threat to the constitutional order"" because of its platform and philosophy, and it is under their observation. An effort to outlaw the party failed in 2003, because the government had many informers and agents in the party, some in high position, who had written part of the material used against them.[68]Since its founding in 1964, the NPD has never managed to win enough votes on the federal level to cross Germany's 5% minimum threshold for representation in the Bundestag; it has succeeded in crossing the 5% threshold and gaining representation in state parliaments 11 times, including one-convocation entry to seven West German state parliaments between November 1966 and April 1968 and two-convocation electoral success in two East German states of Saxony and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern between 2004 and 2011. Since 2016, the NPD is again not represented in state parliaments. Udo Voigt led the NPD from 1996 to 2011. He was succeeded by Holger Apfel, who in turn was replaced by Udo Past\u00f6rs in December 2013. In November 2014, Past\u00f6rs was ousted and Frank Franz became the party's leader. Voigt was elected the party's first Member of the European Parliament in 2014. The party lost the seat in the 2019 European Parliament election.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.439","National Rifle Association","","The National Rifle Association of America (NRA) is a gun rights advocacy group based in the United States. Founded in 1871, the group has informed its members about firearm-related legislation since 1934, and it has directly lobbied for and against firearms legislation since 1975.Founded to advance rifle marksmanship, the modern NRA continues to teach firearm safety and competency. The organization also publishes several magazines, and sponsors competitive marksmanship events. According to the NRA, it had nearly 5 million members as of December 2018, though that figure has not been independently confirmed.Observers and lawmakers see the NRA as one of the three most influential lobbying groups in Washington, D.C. The NRA Institute for Legislative Action (NRA-ILA) is its lobbying division, which manages its political action committee (PAC), the Political Victory Fund (PVF). Over its history the organization has influenced legislation, participated in or initiated lawsuits, and endorsed or opposed various candidates at local, state, and federal levels. Some notable lobbying efforts by the NRA-ILA are the Firearm Owners Protection Act, which lessened restrictions of the Gun Control Act of 1968, and the Dickey Amendment, which blocks the CDC from using federal funds to advocate for gun control.  The NRA has been criticized by gun control and gun rights advocacy groups, political commentators, and politicians. The organization has been the focus of intense criticism in the aftermath of high-profile shootings, such as the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting and the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, after which they suggested adding armed security guards to schools.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.441","Native American name controversy","","The Native American name controversy is an ongoing discussion about the changing terminology used by the indigenous peoples of the Americas to describe themselves, as well as how they prefer to be referred to by others. Preferred terms vary primarily by region and age. As indigenous people and communities are diverse, there is no consensus on naming, aside from the fact that most people prefer to be referred to by their specific nation.\nWhen discussing broad groups of peoples, naming may be based on shared language, region, or historical relationship, such as ""Algonquin-speaking peoples"", ""Pueblo-dwelling peoples"", ""Plains Indians"" or ""LDN peoples"" (Lakota, Dakota and Nakota peoples).\nMany English exonyms have been used to refer to the indigenous peoples of the Americas (also known as the New World), who were resident within their own countries when European colonists arrived in the 15th and 16th centuries. Some of these names were based on French, Spanish, or other European language terminology used by earlier explorers and colonists; some resulted from the colonists' attempt to translate endonyms from the native language into their own; and some were pejorative terms arising out of prejudice and fear, during periods of conflict (such as the American Indian Wars) between the cultures involved.\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, indigenous peoples in the Americas have been more vocal about the ways they wish to be referred to, pressing for the elimination of terms widely considered to be obsolete, inaccurate, or racist. During the latter half of the 20th century and the rise of the Indian rights movement, the United States government responded by proposing the use of the term ""Native American"", to recognize the primacy of indigenous peoples' tenure in the nation. The term has been met with only partial acceptance. Other naming conventions have been proposed and used, but none are accepted by all indigenous groups. Typically, each name has a particular audience and political or cultural connotation, and regional usage varies.\nIn Canada, while Status Indian remains a legal designation due to the Indian Act, the term ""Indian"" is generally considered offensive when used by non-Natives. The term First Nations is preferred for peoples covered by the Indian Act, and Indigenous peoples preferred for Native peoples generally or when talking about Inuit and M\u00e9tis who do not fall under the ""First Nations"" category.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.442","Native Americans in the United States","","Native Americans, also known as American Indians, Indigenous Americans and other terms, are the indigenous peoples of the United States, except Hawaii and territories of the United States. More than 570 federally recognized tribes live within the US, about half of which are associated with Indian reservations. The term ""American Indian"" excludes Native Hawaiians and some Alaskan Natives, while ""Native Americans"" (as defined by the US Census) are American Indians, plus Alaska Natives of all ethnicities. The US Census does not include Native Hawaiians or Chamorro, instead being included in the Census grouping of ""Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander"".\nThe ancestors of living Native Americans arrived in what is now the United States at least 15,000 years ago, possibly much earlier, from Asia via Beringia. A vast variety of peoples, societies and cultures subsequently developed. Native Americans were greatly affected by the European colonization of the Americas, which began in 1492, and their population declined precipitously overwhelmingly due to introduced diseases as well as warfare, including biological warfare, territorial confiscation and slavery. After its creation, the United States, as part of its policy of settler colonialism, waged war and perpetrated massacres against many Native American peoples, removed them from their ancestral lands, and subjected them to one-sided treaties and to discriminatory government policies into the 20th century. Since the 1960s, Native American self-determination movements have resulted in changes to the lives of Native Americans, though there are still many contemporary issues faced by Native Americans. Today, there are over five million Native Americans in the United States, 78% of whom live outside reservations.\nWhen the United States was created, established Native American tribes were generally considered semi-independent nations, as they generally lived in communities separate from British settlers. The federal government signed treaties at a government-to-government level until the Indian Appropriations Act of 1871 ended recognition of independent native nations, and started treating them as ""domestic dependent nations"" subject to federal law. This law did preserve the rights and privileges agreed to under the treaties, including a large degree of tribal sovereignty. For this reason, many (but not all) Native American reservations are still independent of state law and actions of tribal citizens on these reservations are subject only to tribal courts and federal law.\nThe Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 granted U.S. citizenship to all Native Americans born in the United States who had not yet obtained it. This emptied the ""Indians not taxed"" category established by the United States Constitution, allowed natives to vote in state and federal elections, and extended the Fourteenth Amendment protections granted to people ""subject to the jurisdiction"" of the United States. However, some states continued to deny Native Americans voting rights for several decades. Bill of Rights protections do not apply to tribal governments, except for those mandated by the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968.","wikipedia","5.6"

"3.443","Natural gas","","Natural gas (also called fossil gas) is a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture consisting primarily of methane, but commonly including varying amounts of other higher alkanes, and sometimes a small percentage of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, hydrogen sulfide, or helium. It is formed when layers of decomposing plant and animal matter are exposed to intense heat and pressure under the surface of the Earth over millions of years. The energy that the plants originally obtained from the sun is stored in the form of chemical bonds in the gas.Natural gas is a non-renewable hydrocarbon used as a source of energy for heating, cooking, and electricity generation. It is also used as a fuel for vehicles and as a chemical feedstock in the manufacture of plastics and other commercially important organic chemicals.\nNatural gas has a complicated effect on climate change; it itself is a greenhouse gas, and it releases carbon dioxide when burned. However, natural gas use often supplants coal use, which is far more environmentally damaging, leading to lower net carbon dioxide emissions in countries such as the United States.Natural gas is found in deep underground rock formations or associated with other hydrocarbon reservoirs in coal beds and as methane clathrates. Petroleum is another resource and fossil fuel found close to and with natural gas. Most natural gas was created over time by two mechanisms: biogenic and thermogenic. Biogenic gas is created by methanogenic organisms in marshes, bogs, landfills, and shallow sediments. Deeper in the earth, at greater temperature and pressure, thermogenic gas is created from buried organic material.In petroleum production, gas is sometimes burned as flare gas. Before natural gas can be used as a fuel, most, but not all, must be processed to remove impurities, including water, to meet the specifications of marketable natural gas. The by-products of this processing include ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, and higher molecular weight hydrocarbons, hydrogen sulfide (which may be converted into pure sulfur), carbon dioxide, water vapor, and sometimes helium and nitrogen.\nNatural gas is sometimes informally referred to simply as ""gas"", especially when compared to other energy sources such as oil or coal. However, it is not to be confused with gasoline, especially in North America, where the term gasoline is often shortened in colloquial usage to gas.","wikipedia","5.9"
"3.444","Nazi Germany","","Nazi Germany is the common English name for Germany between 1933 and 1945, when Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party (NSDAP) controlled the country through a dictatorship. Under Hitler's rule, Germany became a totalitarian state where nearly all aspects of life were controlled by the government. The official name of the state was Deutsches Reich (German Reich) until 1943 and Gro\u00dfdeutsches Reich (Greater German Reich) from 1943 to 1945. Nazi Germany is also known as the Third Reich (Drittes Reich), meaning ""Third Realm"" or ""Third Empire"", the first two being the Holy Roman Empire (800\u20131806) and the German Empire (1871\u20131918). The Nazi regime ended after the Allies defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe.\nHitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany by the President of the Weimar Republic, Paul von Hindenburg, on 30 January 1933. The NSDAP then began to eliminate all political opposition and consolidate its power. Hindenburg died on 2 August 1934 and Hitler became dictator of Germany by merging the offices and powers of the Chancellery and Presidency. A national referendum held 19 August 1934 confirmed Hitler as sole F\u00fchrer (leader) of Germany. All power was centralised in Hitler's person and his word became the highest law. The government was not a coordinated, co-operating body, but a collection of factions struggling for power and Hitler's favour. In the midst of the Great Depression, the Nazis restored economic stability and ended mass unemployment using heavy military spending and a mixed economy. Using deficit spending, the regime undertook extensive public works, including the construction of Autobahnen (motorways). The return to economic stability boosted the regime's popularity.\nRacism, especially antisemitism, was a central ideological feature of the regime. The Germanic peoples were considered by the Nazis to be the master race, the purest branch of the Aryan race. Discrimination and persecution against Jews and Romani people began in earnest after the seizure of power. The first concentration camps were established in March 1933. Jews and others deemed undesirable were imprisoned, and liberals, socialists, and communists were killed, imprisoned, or exiled. Christian churches and citizens that opposed Hitler's rule were oppressed, and many leaders imprisoned. Education focused on racial biology, population policy, and fitness for military service. Career and educational opportunities for women were curtailed. Recreation and tourism were organised via the Strength Through Joy program, and the 1936 Summer Olympics showcased Germany on the international stage. Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels made effective use of film, mass rallies, and Hitler's hypnotic oratory to influence public opinion. The government controlled artistic expression, promoting specific art forms and banning or discouraging others.\nThe Nazi regime dominated neighbours through military threats in the years leading up to war. Nazi Germany made increasingly aggressive territorial demands, threatening war if these were not met. It seized Austria and almost all of Czechoslovakia in 1938 and 1939. Germany signed a non-aggression pact with the USSR, and invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, launching World War II in Europe. By early 1941, Germany controlled much of Europe. Reichskommissariats took control of conquered areas and a German administration was established in the remainder of Poland. Germany exploited the raw materials and labour of both its occupied territories and its allies. Einsatzgruppen paramilitary death squads inside the occupied territories conducted mass killings of millions of Jews and other peoples deemed undesirable by the state. Many others were imprisoned, worked to death, or murdered in Nazi concentration camps and extermination camps. This genocide is known as the Holocaust.\nWhile the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 was initially successful, the Soviet resurgence and entry of the United States into the war meant the Wehrmacht (German armed forces) lost the initiative on the Eastern Front in 1943 and by late 1944 had been pushed back to the pre-1939 border. Large-scale aerial bombing of Germany escalated in 1944 and the Axis powers were driven back in Eastern and Southern Europe. After the Allied invasion of France, Germany was conquered by the Soviet Union from the east and the other Allies from the west, and capitulated in May 1945. Hitler's refusal to admit defeat led to massive destruction of German infrastructure and additional war-related deaths in the closing months of the war. The victorious Allies initiated a policy of denazification and put many of the surviving Nazi leadership on trial for war crimes at the Nuremberg trials.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.445","Nazism","","National Socialism (German: Nationalsozialismus), more commonly known as Nazism (), is the ideology and practices associated with the Nazi Party\u2014officially the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei or NSDAP)\u2014in Nazi Germany, and of other far-right groups with similar ideas and aims.\nNazism is a form of fascism and showed that ideology's disdain for liberal democracy and the parliamentary system, but also incorporated fervent antisemitism, anti-communism, scientific racism, and eugenics into its creed. Its extreme nationalism came from Pan-Germanism and the ethno-nationalist v\u00f6lkisch movement prominent in the German nationalism of the time, and it was strongly influenced by the Freikorps paramilitary groups that emerged after Germany's defeat in World War I, from which came the party's ""cult of violence"" which was ""at the heart of the movement.""Nazism subscribed to pseudo-scientific theories of racial hierarchy and Social Darwinism, identifying the Germans as a part of what the Nazis regarded as an Aryan or Nordic master race. It aimed to overcome social divisions and create a German homogeneous society based on racial purity which represented a people's community (Volksgemeinschaft). The Nazis aimed to unite all Germans living in historically German territory, as well as gain additional lands for German expansion under the doctrine of Lebensraum and exclude those who they deemed either community aliens or ""inferior"" races.\nThe term ""National Socialism"" arose out of attempts to create a nationalist redefinition of ""socialism"", as an alternative to both Marxist international socialism and free market capitalism. Nazism rejected the Marxist concepts of class conflict and universal equality, opposed cosmopolitan internationalism, and sought to convince all parts of the new German society to subordinate their personal interests to the ""common good"", accepting political interests as the main priority of economic organization, which tended to match the general outlook of collectivism or communitarianism rather than economic socialism.\nThe Nazi Party's precursor, the Pan-German nationalist and antisemitic German Workers' Party, was founded on 5 January 1919. By the early 1920s the party was renamed the National Socialist German Workers' Party\u2014to attract workers away from left-wing parties such as the Social Democrats (SPD) and the Communists (KPD)\u2014and Adolf Hitler assumed control of the organization. The National Socialist Program or ""25 Points"" was adopted in 1920 and called for a united Greater Germany that would deny citizenship to Jews or those of Jewish descent, while also supporting land reform and the nationalization of some industries. In Mein Kampf (""My Struggle""; 1924\u20131925), Hitler outlined the anti-Semitism and anti-Communism at the heart of his political philosophy, as well as his disdain for representative democracy and his belief in Germany's right to territorial expansion.The Nazi Party won the greatest share of the popular vote in the two Reichstag general elections of 1932, making them the largest party in the legislature by far, but still short of an outright majority. Because none of the parties were willing or able to put together a coalition government, in 1933 Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany by President Paul von Hindenburg, through the support and connivance of traditional conservative nationalists who believed that they could control him and his party. Through the use of emergency presidential decrees by Hindenburg, and a change in the Weimar Constitution which allowed the Cabinet to rule by direct decree, bypassing both Hindenburg and the Reichstag, the Nazis had soon established a one-party state.\nThe Sturmabteilung (SA) and the Schutzstaffel (SS) functioned as the paramilitary organizations of the Nazi Party. Using the SS for the task, Hitler purged the party's more socially and economically radical factions in the mid-1934 Night of the Long Knives, including the leadership of the SA. After the death of President Hindenburg, political power was concentrated in Hitler's hands and he became Germany's head of state as well as the head of the government, with the title of F\u00fchrer, meaning ""leader"". From that point, Hitler was effectively the dictator of Nazi Germany, which was also known as the ""Third Reich"", under which Jews, political opponents and other ""undesirable"" elements were marginalized, imprisoned or murdered. Many millions of people were eventually exterminated in a genocide which became known as the Holocaust during World War II, including around two-thirds of the Jewish population of Europe.\nFollowing Germany's defeat in World War II and the discovery of the full extent of the Holocaust, Nazi ideology became universally disgraced. It is widely regarded as immoral and evil, with only a few fringe racist groups, usually referred to as neo-Nazis, describing themselves as followers of National Socialism.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.446","Necrophilia","","Necrophilia, also known as necrophilism, necrolagnia, necrocoitus, necrochlesis, and thanatophilia, is a sexual attraction or sexual act which involves corpses.

"3.447","Neocatechumenal Way","","The Neocatechumenal Way, also known as the Neocatechumenate, NCW, colloquially The Way, is a charism within the Catholic Church dedicated to Christian formation. It was formed in Madrid in 1964 by Kiko Arg\u00fcello and Carmen Hern\u00e1ndez.Taking its inspiration from the catechumenate of the early Catholic Church by which converts from paganism were prepared for baptism, it provides post-baptismal formation to adults who are already members of the Church or to those far from the Church who have been attracted by the testimony of Christian life of love and unity in the communities (referencing such Bible verses as John 13:35 and 17:21), in accordance with the designs of the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults (RCIA). Due to numerous vocations coming from the families formed in the communities, it has also helped to establish and run over 100 missionary diocesan seminaries in various locations. They are called ""Redemptoris Mater"" seminaries. It is responsible for communities of ""families in mission"", called ""Missio ad gentes"", living in many cities around the world. Together with a priest and his socius, and some celibate women, they make present the Church in places of little or no Catholic presence.\nThe Neocatechumenate, as an itinerary of Christian initiation, is implemented in small, parish-based communities of up to 50 people. In 2007 there were around 20,000 such communities throughout the World, with an estimated million Catholics following the itinerary.","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.448","Neoconservatism","","Neoconservatism is a political movement born in the United States during the 1960s among liberal hawks who became disenchanted with the increasingly pacifist foreign policy of the Democratic Party, and the growing New Left and counterculture, in particular the Vietnam protests. Some also began to question their liberal beliefs regarding domestic policies such as the Great Society.\nNeoconservatives typically advocate the promotion of democracy and interventionism in international affairs, including peace through strength (by means of military force), and are known for espousing disdain for communism and for political radicalism.Many of its adherents became politically famous during the Republican presidential administrations of the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s as neoconservatives peaked in influence during the administration of George W. Bush, when they played a major role in promoting and planning the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Prominent neoconservatives in the George W. Bush administration included Paul Wolfowitz, Elliott Abrams, Richard Perle, and Paul Bremer. While not identifying as neoconservatives, senior officials Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld listened closely to neoconservative advisers regarding foreign policy, especially the defense of Israel and the promotion of American influence in the Middle East.\nHistorically speaking, the term ""neoconservative"" refers to those who made the ideological journey from the anti-Stalinist left to the camp of American conservatism during the 1960s and 1970s. The movement had its intellectual roots in the  magazine Commentary, edited by Norman Podhoretz. They spoke out against the New Left and in that way helped define the movement.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.449","Neoliberalism","","Neoliberalism or neo-liberalism is the 20th-century resurgence of 19th-century ideas associated with laissez-faire economic liberalism and free market capitalism. It is generally associated with policies of economic liberalization including privatization, deregulation, globalization, free trade, austerity, and reductions in government spending in order to increase the role of the private sector in the economy and society; however, the defining features of neoliberalism in both thought and practice have been the subject of substantial scholarly debate. Neoliberalism constituted a paradigm shift away from the post-war Keynesian consensus which had lasted from 1945 to 1980.English-speakers have used the term ""neoliberalism"" since the start of the 20th century with different meanings, but it became more prevalent in its current meaning in the 1970s and 1980s, used by scholars in a wide variety of social sciences as well as by critics. The term is rarely used by proponents of free market policies. Some scholars have described the term as meaning different things to different people as neoliberalism has ""mutated"" into geopolitically distinct hybrids as it travelled around the world. As such, neoliberalism shares many attributes with other concepts that have contested meanings, including representative democracy.The definition and usage of the term have changed over time. As an economic philosophy, neoliberalism emerged among European liberal scholars in the 1930s as they attempted to revive and renew central ideas from classical liberalism as they saw these ideas diminish in popularity, overtaken by recognition of the need to control markets, following the great depression and manifested in policies designed to counter the volatility of free markets, and mitigate their negative social consequences. The impetus for this development arose from a desire to avoid repeating the economic failures of the early 1930s, which was identified to be created by the economic policy of classical liberalism. \nWhen the term entered into common use in the 1980s in connection with Augusto Pinochet's economic reforms in Chile, it quickly took on negative connotations and was employed principally by critics of market reform and laissez-faire capitalism. Scholars  tended to associate it with the theories of Mont Pelerin Society economists Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, and James M. Buchanan, along with politicians and policy-makers such as Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan and Alan Greenspan. Once the new meaning of neoliberalism became established as a common usage among Spanish-speaking scholars, it diffused into the English-language study of political economy. By 1994, with the passage of NAFTA and with the Zapatistas' reaction to this development in Chiapas, the term entered global circulation. Scholarship on the phenomenon of neoliberalism has been growing over the last few decades.\n\n","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.451","Netiquette","","Online etiquette is ingrained into culture, although etiquette in technology is a fairly recent concept. The rules of etiquette that apply when communicating over the Internet or social networks or devices are different from those applied when communicating in person or by audio (such as telephone) or videophone. It is a social code of network communication and help.\nCommunicating with others via the Internet without misunderstandings in the heat of the moment can be challenging, mainly because input from facial expressions and body language is absent in cyberspace. Therefore, several recommendations to attempt to safeguard against these misunderstandings have been proposed.","wikipedia","5.13"
"3.450","Net neutrality","","Network neutrality, or simply net neutrality, is the principle that Internet service providers (ISPs) must treat all Internet communications equally, and not discriminate or charge differently based on user, content, website, platform, application, type of equipment, source address, destination address, or method of communication.With net neutrality, ISPs may not intentionally block, slow down, or charge money for specific online content. Without net neutrality, ISPs may prioritize certain types of traffic, meter others, or potentially block traffic from specific services, while charging consumers for various tiers of service.\nThe term was coined by Columbia University media law professor Tim Wu in 2003, as an extension of the longstanding concept of a common carrier, which was used to describe the role of telephone systems. Net neutrality regulations may be referred to as ""common carrier"" regulations. Net neutrality does not block all abilities that Internet service providers have to impact their customers' services. Opt-in/opt-out services exist on the end user side, and filtering can be done on a local basis, as in the filtration of sensitive material for minors.Research suggests that a combination of policy instruments will help realize the range of valued political and economic objectives central to the network neutrality debate. Combined with strong public opinion, this has led some governments to regulate broadband Internet services as a public utility, similar to the way electricity, gas, and the water supply are regulated, along with limiting providers and regulating the options those providers can offer.Proponents of net neutrality, which include computer science experts, consumer advocates, human rights organizations, and Internet content providers claim that net neutrality helps to provide freedom of information exchange, promotes competition and innovation for Internet services, and upholds standardization of Internet data transmission which was essential for its growth. Opponents of net neutrality, which include ISPs, and telecom equipment manufacturers, assert that net neutrality requirements would reduce their incentive to build out the Internet, reduces competition in the marketplace, and may raise their operating costs which they would have to pass along to their users.\nNet neutrality is administrated on a national or regional basis,  though much of the world's focus has been on the conflict over net neutrality in the United States. Net neutrality in the United States has been a topic since the early 1990s, as they were one of the world leaders in online service providing. However, they face the same problems as the rest of the world. Finding an appropriate solution to creating more regulation for Internet Service Providers has been a major work in progress.","wikipedia","5.4"
"3.452","New Age","","New Age is a term applied to a range of spiritual or religious beliefs and practices that grew rapidly in the Western World during the 1970s. Precise scholarly definitions of the New Age differ in their emphasis, largely as a result of its highly eclectic structure. Although analytically often considered to be religious, those involved in it typically prefer the designation of spiritual or Mind, Body, Spirit and rarely use the term New Age themselves. Many scholars of the subject refer to it as the New Age movement, although others contest this term and suggest that it is better seen as a milieu or zeitgeist.\nAs a form of Western esotericism, the New Age drew heavily upon a number of older esoteric traditions, in particular, those that emerged from the occultist current that developed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Such prominent occultist influences include the work of Emanuel Swedenborg and Franz Mesmer, as well as the ideas of Freemasonry, Spiritualism, New Thought, and Theosophy. A number of mid-twentieth century influences, such as the UFO religions of the 1950s, the counterculture of the 1960s, and the Human Potential Movement, also exerted a strong influence on the early development of the New Age. The exact origins of the phenomenon remain contested, but there is general agreement that it became a major movement in the 1970s, at which time it was centered largely in the United Kingdom. It expanded and grew largely in the 1980s and 1990s, in particular within the United States. By the start of the 21st century, the term New Age was increasingly rejected within this milieu, with some scholars arguing that the New Age phenomenon had ended.\nDespite its highly eclectic nature, a number of beliefs commonly found within the New Age have been identified. Theologically, the New Age typically adopts a belief in a holistic form of divinity that imbues all of the universe, including human beings themselves. There is thus a strong emphasis on the spiritual authority of the self. This is accompanied by a common belief in a wide variety of semi-divine non-human entities, such as angels and masters, with whom humans can communicate, particularly through the form of channeling. Typically viewing human history as being divided into a series of distinct ages, a common New Age belief is that whereas once humanity lived in an age of great technological advancement and spiritual wisdom, it has entered a period of spiritual degeneracy, which will be remedied through the establishment of a coming Age of Aquarius, from which the milieu gets its name. There is also a strong focus on healing, particularly using forms of alternative medicine, and an emphasis on the notion that spirituality and science can be unified.\nCentered primarily in Western countries, those involved in the New Age have predominantly been from middle and upper-middle-class backgrounds. The degree to which New Agers are involved in the milieu varied considerably, from those who adopted a number of New Age ideas and practices to those who fully embraced and dedicated their lives to it. The New Age has generated criticism from established Christian organisations as well as modern Pagan and indigenous communities. From the 1990s onward, the New Age became the subject of research by academic scholars of religious studies.\n\n","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.453","New Kadampa Tradition","","The New Kadampa Tradition \u2013 International Kadampa Buddhist Union (NKT\u2014IKBU) is a global Buddhist new religious movement founded by Kelsang Gyatso in England in 1991. In 2003 the words ""International Kadampa Buddhist Union"" (IKBU) were added to the original name ""New Kadampa Tradition"". The NKT-IKBU is an international organisation registered in England as a charitable, or non-profit, company. It currently lists more than 200 centres and around 900 branch classes/study groups in forty countries.The NKT-IKBU describes itself as ""an entirely independent Buddhist tradition"" inspired and guided by ""the ancient Kadampa Buddhist Masters and their teachings, as presented by Kelsang Gyatso"". Its founder, Kelsang Gyatso, has sought to make Buddhist meditation and teaching more readily accessible to twenty-first century living. He also wanted to ensure that people did not simply study Tibetan Buddhism from an academic point of view, but learned how to extend this knowledge through meditation and practical Buddhist experience. The NKT-IKBU is described as being ""very successful at disseminating its teachings"" and Geshe Kelsang's books have been called ""very popular"".The NKT-IKBU has expanded more rapidly than any other Buddhist tradition in Britain. It has been described as a ""controversial organization"" and a ""controversial"" new religious movement, a cult, or a breakaway Buddhist sect.","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.454","New World Order (conspiracy theory)","","The New World Order or NWO is claimed to be an emerging clandestine totalitarian world government by various conspiracy theories.The common theme in conspiracy theories about a New World Order is that a secretive power elite with a globalist agenda is conspiring to eventually rule the world through an authoritarian world government\u2014which will replace sovereign nation-states\u2014and an all-encompassing propaganda whose ideology hails the establishment of the New World Order as the culmination of history's progress. Many influential historical and contemporary figures have therefore been alleged to be part of a cabal that operates through many front organizations to orchestrate significant political and financial events, ranging from causing systemic crises to pushing through controversial policies, at both national and international levels, as steps in an ongoing plot to achieve world domination.Before the early 1990s, New World Order conspiracism was limited to two American countercultures, primarily the militantly anti-government right and secondarily that part of fundamentalist Christianity concerned with the end-time emergence of the Antichrist. Skeptics, such as Michael Barkun and Chip Berlet, observed that right-wing populist conspiracy theories about a New World Order had not only been embraced by many seekers of stigmatized knowledge but had seeped into popular culture, thereby inaugurating a period during the late 20th and early 21st centuries in the United States where people are actively preparing for apocalyptic millenarian scenarios. Those political scientists are concerned that mass hysteria over New World Order conspiracy theories could eventually have devastating effects on American political life, ranging from escalating lone-wolf terrorism to the rise to power of authoritarian ultranationalist demagogues.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.455","Nikola Tesla","","Nikola Tesla (; Serbo-Croatian: [n\u01d0kola t\u00easla]; Cyrillic: \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430 \u0422\u0435\u0441\u043b\u0430; 10 July 1856 \u2013 7 January 1943) was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist who is best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree, and gained practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry. He emigrated in 1884 to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His alternating current (AC) induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company eventually marketed.\nAttempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a wireless-controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and demonstrated his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his showmanship at public lectures. Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs. In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it.After Wardenclyffe, Tesla experimented with a series of inventions in the 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success. Having spent most of his money, Tesla lived in a series of New York hotels, leaving behind unpaid bills. He died in New York City in January 1943. Tesla's work fell into relative obscurity following his death, until 1960, when the General Conference on Weights and Measures named the SI unit of magnetic flux density the tesla in his honor. There has been a resurgence in popular interest in Tesla since the 1990s.\n\n","wikipedia","5.8"

"3.457","Nordic race","","The Nordic race is one of the putative sub-races into which some late-19th to mid-20th century anthropologists has divided the Caucasian race. People of the Nordic type are mostly found in Northern Europe, particularly among populations in the areas surrounding the Baltic Sea, such as Balts, Germanic peoples, Baltic Finns and certain Celts and Slavs. The physical traits of the Nordics were described as light eyes, light skin, tall stature and a dolichocephalic skull. The psychological traits of Nordics were described as truthful, equitable, competitive, naive, reserved and individualistic. Other supposed sub-races were the Alpine race, Dinaric race, Iranid race, East Baltic race, and the Mediterranean race. In the early 20th century, beliefs that the Nordic race constituted the superior branch of the Caucasian race gave rise of the ideology of Nordicism. Though this ideology has since been discredited, the concept of a Nordic sub-race remains in use among physicial anthropologists.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.458","North American Man/Boy Love Association","","The North American Man/Boy Love Association (NAMBLA) is a pedophilia and pederasty advocacy organization in the United States. It works to abolish age-of-consent laws criminalizing adult sexual involvement with minors and campaigns for the release of men who have been jailed for sexual contacts with minors that did not involve what it considers coercion. The group no longer holds regular national meetings, and as of the late 1990s—to avoid local police infiltration—the organization discouraged the formation of local chapters. Around 1995, an undercover detective discovered there were 1,100 people on the organization's rolls. NAMBLA was the largest group in IPCE, an international pro-pedophile activist organization. Since then, the organization has dwindled to only a handful of people, with many members joining online pedophile networks, according to Xavier Von Erck, director of operations at the anti-pedophile organization Perverted-Justice. As of 2005, a newspaper report stated that NAMBLA was based in New York and San Francisco.","wikipedia","5.7"

Located in the northeast of the island of Ireland, Northern Ireland shares a border to the south and west with the Republic of Ireland. In 2011, its population was 1,810,863, constituting about 30% of the island's total population and about 3% of the UK's population. Established by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 as part of the Good Friday Agreement, the Northern Ireland Assembly (colloquially referred to as Stormont after its location) holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters, while other areas are reserved for the British government. Northern Ireland co-operates with the Republic of Ireland in several areas, and the Agreement granted the Republic the ability to ""put forward views and proposals"" with ""determined efforts to resolve disagreements between the two governments"".On 11 January 2020, legislators in Northern Ireland formed a government for the first time since the Executive of the 5th Northern Ireland Assembly collapsed in January 2017, following the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal.\nNorthern Ireland was created in 1921, when Ireland was partitioned between Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland by the Government of Ireland Act 1920. Unlike Southern Ireland, which would become the Irish Free State in 1922, the majority of Northern Ireland's population were unionists, who wanted to remain within the United Kingdom. Most of these were the Protestant descendants of colonists from Great Britain. However, a significant minority, mostly Catholics, were nationalists who wanted a united Ireland independent of British rule. Today, the former generally see themselves as British and the latter generally see themselves as Irish, while a distinct Northern Irish or Ulster identity is claimed both by a large minority of Catholics and Protestants and by many of those who are non-aligned.For most of the 20th century, when it came into existence, Northern Ireland was marked by discrimination and hostility between these two sides in what First Minister of Northern Ireland, David Trimble, called a ""cold house"" for Catholics. In the late 1960s, conflict between state forces and chiefly Protestant unionists on the one hand, and chiefly Catholic nationalists on the other, erupted into three decades of violence known as the Troubles, which claimed over 3,500 lives and injured over 50,000 others. The 1998 Good Friday Agreement was a major step in the peace process, including the decommissioning of weapons and security normalisation, although sectarianism and religious segregation still remain major social problems, and sporadic violence has continued.Northern Ireland was the most industrialised region of Ireland, declining as a result of the political and social turmoil of the Troubles, but economically growing significantly since the late 1990s. The initial growth came from the ""peace dividend"" and the links which increased trade with the Republic of Ireland, continuing with a significant increase in tourism, investment and business from around the world. Unemployment in Northern Ireland peaked at 17.2% in 1986, dropping to 6.1% for June\u2013August 2014 and down by 1.2 percentage points over the year, similar to the UK figure of 6.2%. 58.2% of those unemployed had been unemployed for over a year.\nCultural links between Northern Ireland, the rest of Ireland, and the rest of the UK are complex, with Northern Ireland sharing both the culture of Ireland and the culture of the United Kingdom. In many sports, the island of Ireland fields a single team, a notable exception being association football. Northern Ireland competes separately at the Commonwealth Games, and people from Northern Ireland may compete for either Great Britain or Ireland at the Olympic Games.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.459","North Korea","","North Korea (Korean: \uc870\uc120; MR: Chos\u014fn or literally \ubd81\uc870\uc120; MR: Pukchos\u014fn), officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK or DPR Korea; Korean: \uc870\uc120\ubbfc\uc8fc\uc8fc\uc758\uc778\ubbfc\uacf5\ud654\uad6d, Chos\u014fn Minjuju\u016di Inmin Konghwaguk), is a country in East Asia constituting the northern part of the Korean Peninsula, with Pyongyang as its capital and the largest city in the country. To the north and northwest, the country is bordered by China and by Russia along the Amnok (known as the Yalu in Chinese) and Tumen rivers, and to the south, it is bordered by South Korea, with the heavily fortified Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) separating the two. Nevertheless, North Korea, like its southern counterpart, claims to be the legitimate government of the entire peninsula and adjacent islands.\nIn 1910, Korea was annexed by Imperial Japan. At the Japanese surrender at the end of World War II in 1945, Korea was divided into two zones, with the north occupied by the Soviet Union and the south occupied by the United States. Negotiations on reunification failed, and in 1948, separate governments were formed: the socialist Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the north, and the capitalist Republic of Korea in the south. An invasion initiated by North Korea led to the Korean War (1950\u20131953). The Korean Armistice Agreement brought about a ceasefire, but no peace treaty was signed.\nNorth Korea officially describes itself as a ""self-reliant"" socialist state, and formally holds elections, though they have been described by outside observers as sham elections. Outside observers also generally view North Korea as a Stalinist dictatorship, particularly noting the elaborate cult of personality around the Kim dynasty. The Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), led by a member of the ruling family, holds absolute power in the state and leads the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland of which all political officers are required to be members. Juche, an ideology of national self-reliance, was introduced into the constitution in 1972. The means of production are owned by the state through state-run enterprises and collectivized farms. Most service\u2014such as healthcare, education, housing and food production\u2014are subsidized or state-funded. From 1994 to 1998, North Korea suffered a famine that resulted in the deaths of between 240,000 and 420,000 people, and the population continues to suffer malnutrition. North Korea follows Songun, or ""military-first"" policy. It is the country with the highest number of military and paramilitary personnel, with a total of 9,495,000 active, reserve and paramilitary personnel, or approximately 37% of its population. Its active duty army of 1.21 million is the fourth largest in the world, after China, the United States and India; consisting of 4.7% of its population. It possesses nuclear weapons. In addition to being a member of the United Nations since 1991, North Korea is also a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, G77 and the ASEAN Regional Forum.\nA 2014 UN inquiry into human rights in North Korea concluded that ""the gravity, scale and nature of these violations reveal a state that does not have any parallel in the contemporary world"". The North Korean regime denies these allegations.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.461","Norton AntiVirus","","Norton AntiVirus is an anti-virus or anti-malware software product, developed and distributed by Symantec Corporation since 1991 as part of its Norton family of computer security products. It uses signatures and heuristics to identify viruses. Other features included in it are e-mail spam filtering and phishing protection.\nSymantec distributes the product as a download, a box copy, and as OEM software. Norton AntiVirus and Norton Internet Security, a related product, held a 61% US retail market share for security suites as of the first half of 2007. Competitors, in terms of market share in this study, include antivirus products from CA, Trend Micro, and Kaspersky Lab.Norton AntiVirus runs on Microsoft Windows, Linux and macOS.  Windows 7 support was in development for versions 2006 through 2008. Version 2009 has Windows 7 supported update already. Versions 2010, 2011, and 2012 all natively support Windows 7, without needing an update. Version 12 is the only version fully compatible with Mac OS X Lion.\nWith the 2015 series of products, Symantec made changes in its portfolio and briefly discontinued Norton AntiVirus. This action was later reversed with the introduction of Norton AntiVirus Basic.\n\n","wikipedia","5.4"
"3.462","Norwegian language","","Norwegian (norsk) is a North Germanic language spoken mainly in Norway, where it is the official language. Along with Swedish and Danish, Norwegian forms a dialect continuum of more or less mutually intelligible local and regional varieties; some Norwegian and Swedish dialects, in particular, are very close. These Scandinavian languages, together with Faroese and Icelandic as well as some extinct languages, constitute the North Germanic languages. Faroese and Icelandic are not mutually intelligible with Norwegian in their spoken form because continental Scandinavian has diverged from them. While the two Germanic languages with the greatest numbers of speakers, English and German, have close similarities with Norwegian, neither is mutually intelligible with it. Norwegian is a descendant of Old Norse, the common language of the Germanic peoples living in Scandinavia during the Viking Era.\nToday there are two official forms of written Norwegian, Bokm\u00e5l (literally ""book tongue"") and Nynorsk (""new Norwegian""), each with its own variants. Bokm\u00e5l developed from the Dano-Norwegian koin\u00e9 language that evolved under the union of Denmark-Norway in the 16th and 17th centuries, while Nynorsk was developed based upon a collective of spoken Norwegian dialects. Norwegian is one of the two official languages in Norway. The other is Sami, spoken by some members of the Sami people, mostly in the Northern part of Norway. Norwegian and Sami are not mutually intelligible, as Sami belongs to the Finno-Ugric group of languages. Sami is spoken by less than one percent of people in Norway.\nNorwegian is one of the working languages of the Nordic Council. Under the Nordic Language Convention, citizens of the Nordic countries who speak Norwegian have the opportunity to use their native language when interacting with official bodies in other Nordic countries without being liable to any interpretation or translation costs.","wikipedia","5.10"
"3.463","Nuclear power","","Nuclear power is the use of nuclear reactions that release nuclear energy to generate heat, which most frequently is then used in steam turbines to produce electricity in a nuclear power plant. Nuclear power can be obtained from nuclear fission, nuclear decay and nuclear fusion reactions.\nPresently, the vast majority of electricity from nuclear power is produced by nuclear fission of uranium and plutonium.\nNuclear decay processes are used in niche applications such as radioisotope thermoelectric generators.\nGenerating electricity from fusion power remains at the focus of international research.\nThis article mostly deals with nuclear fission power for electricity generation.\nCivilian nuclear power supplied 2,563 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity in 2018, equivalent to about 10% of global electricity generation, and was the second largest low-carbon power source after hydroelectricity. \nAs of December 2019, there are 443 civilian fission reactors in the world, with a combined electrical capacity of 395 gigawatt (GW).\nThere are also 56 nuclear power reactors under construction and 109 reactors planned, with a combined capacity of 60 GW and 120 GW, respectively.\n\nMost reactors under construction are generation III reactors in Asia.Nuclear power has one of the lowest levels of fatalities per unit of energy generated compared to other energy sources. Coal, petroleum, natural gas and hydroelectricity each have caused more fatalities per unit of energy due to air pollution and accidents.\nSince its commercialization in the 1970s, nuclear power has prevented about 1.84 million air pollution-related deaths and the emission of about 64 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent that would have otherwise resulted from the burning of fossil fuels.Accidents in nuclear power plants include the Chernobyl disaster in the Soviet Union in 1986, the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan in 2011, and the more contained Three Mile Island accident in the United States in 1979.\nThere have also been some nuclear submarine accidents.\nThere is a debate about nuclear power.\nProponents, such as the World Nuclear Association and Environmentalists for Nuclear Energy, contend that nuclear power is a safe, sustainable energy source (see also Nuclear power proposed as renewable energy) that reduces carbon emissions.\nNuclear power opponents, such as Greenpeace and NIRS, contend that nuclear power poses many threats to people and the environment.\nCollaboration on research and development towards greater efficiency, safety and recycling of spent fuel in future generation IV reactors presently includes Euratom and the co-operation of more than 10 permanent member countries globally.","wikipedia","['5.9','5.4']"

"3.465","Nutrition","","Nutrition is the science that interprets the nutrients and other substances in food in relation to maintenance, growth, reproduction, health and disease of an organism. It includes food intake, absorption, assimilation, biosynthesis, catabolism and excretion.The diet of an organism is what it eats, which is largely determined by the availability and palatability of foods. For humans, a healthy diet includes preparation of food and storage methods that preserve nutrients from oxidation, heat or leaching, and that reduces risk of foodborne illnesses. The seven major classes of human nutrients are carbohydrates, fats, fiber, minerals, proteins, vitamins, and water. Nutrients can be grouped as either macronutrients or micronutrients (needed in small quantities).\nIn humans, an unhealthy diet can cause deficiency-related diseases such as blindness, anemia, scurvy, preterm birth, stillbirth and cretinism, or nutrient excess health-threatening conditions such as obesity and metabolic syndrome; and such common chronic systemic diseases as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and osteoporosis. Undernutrition can lead to wasting in acute cases, and the stunting of marasmus in chronic cases of malnutrition.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.466","Obesity","","Obesity is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to an extent that it may have a negative effect on health. People are generally considered obese when their body mass index (BMI), a measurement obtained by dividing a person's weight by the square of the person's height, is over 30 kg/m2; the range 25\u201330 kg/m2 is defined as overweight. Some East Asian countries use lower values. Obesity increases the likelihood of various diseases and conditions, particularly cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, certain types of cancer, osteoarthritis, and depression.Obesity is most commonly caused by a combination of excessive food intake, lack of physical activity, and genetic susceptibility. A few cases are caused primarily by genes, endocrine disorders, medications, or mental disorder. The view that obese people eat little yet gain weight due to a slow metabolism is not medically supported. On average, obese people have a greater energy expenditure than their normal counterparts due to the energy required to maintain an increased body mass.Obesity is mostly preventable through a combination of social changes and personal choices. Changes to diet and exercising are the main treatments. Diet quality can be improved by reducing the consumption of energy-dense foods, such as those high in fat or sugars, and by increasing the intake of dietary fiber. Medications can be used, along with a suitable diet, to reduce appetite or decrease fat absorption. If diet, exercise, and medication are not effective, a gastric balloon or surgery may be performed to reduce stomach volume or length of the intestines, leading to feeling full earlier or a reduced ability to absorb nutrients from food.Obesity is a leading preventable cause of death worldwide, with increasing rates in adults and children. In 2015, 600 million adults (12%) and 100 million children were obese in 195 countries. Obesity is more common in women than men. Authorities view it as one of the most serious public health problems of the 21st century. Obesity is stigmatized in much of the modern world (particularly in the Western world), though it was seen as a symbol of wealth and fertility at other times in history and still is in some parts of the world. In 2013, several medical societies, including the American Medical Association and the American Heart Association, classified obesity as a disease.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.467","Object-oriented programming","","Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of ""objects"", which can contain data, in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods). A feature of objects is an object's procedures that can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of ""this"" or ""self""). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another. OOP languages are diverse, but the most popular ones are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes, which also determine their types.\nMany of the most widely used programming languages (such as C++, Java, Python, etc.) are multi-paradigm and they support object-oriented programming to a greater or lesser degree, typically in combination with imperative, procedural programming. Significant object-oriented languages include\nJava,\nC++,\nC#,\nPython,\nPHP,\nJavaScript,\nRuby,\nPerl,\nObject Pascal,\nObjective-C,\nDart,\nSwift,\nScala,\nCommon Lisp,\nMATLAB,\nand\nSmalltalk.","wikipedia","5.4"
"3.468","Occitan language","","Occitan (English:  , Occitan: [utsi\u02c8ta], French: [\u0254ksit\u0251\u0303]), also known as lenga d'\u00f2c (Occitan: [\u02c8le\u014b\u0261\u0254 \u02c8\u00f0\u0254(k)] (listen); French: langue d'oc) by its native speakers, is a Romance language spoken in Southern France, Monaco, Italy's Occitan Valleys, as well as Spain's Val d'Aran; collectively, these regions are sometimes referred to as Occitania. It is also spoken in the linguistic enclave of Guardia Piemontese (Calabria, Italy). Some include Catalan in Occitan, as the distance between this language and some Occitan dialects (such as the Gascon language) is similar to the distance among different Occitan dialects. In fact, Catalan was considered a dialect of Occitan until the end of the 19th century and still today remains its closest relative.Occitan is an official language of Catalonia, where a subdialect of Gascon known as Aranese is spoken in the Val d'Aran. Since September 2010, the Parliament of Catalonia has considered Aranese Occitan to be the officially preferred language for use in the Val d'Aran.\nAcross history, the terms Limousin (Lemosin), Languedocien (Lengadocian), Gascon, and later Proven\u00e7al (Proven\u00e7al, Proven\u00e7au or Prouven\u00e7au) have been used as synonyms for the whole of Occitan; nowadays, ""Proven\u00e7al"" is understood mainly as the Occitan dialect spoken in Provence, in southeast France.Unlike other Romance languages such as French or Spanish, there is no single written standard language called ""Occitan"", and Occitan has no official status in France, home to most of Occitania. Instead, there are competing norms for writing Occitan, some of which attempt to be pan-dialectal, whereas others are based on particular dialects. These efforts are hindered by the rapidly declining use of Occitan as a spoken language in much of southern France, as well as by the significant differences in phonology and vocabulary among different Occitan dialects.\nIn particular, the northern and easternmost dialects have more morphological and phonetic features in common with the Gallo-Italic and O\u00efl languages (e.g. nasal vowels; loss of final consonants; initial cha/ja- instead of ca/ga-; uvular \u27e8r\u27e9; the front-rounded sound /\u00f8/ instead of a diphthong, /w/ instead of /l/ before a consonant), whereas the southernmost dialects have more features in common with the Ibero-Romance languages (e.g. betacism; voiced fricatives between vowels in place of voiced stops; -ch- in place of -it-), and Gascon has a number of unusual features not seen in other dialects (e.g. /h/ in place of /f/; loss of /n/ between vowels; intervocalic -r- and final -t/ch in place of medieval -ll-). There are also significant lexical differences, where some dialects have words cognate with French, and others have Catalan and Spanish cognates (maison/casa ""house"", testa/cap ""head"", petit/pichon ""small"", achaptar/crompar ""to buy"", entendre/ausir ""to hear"", se taire/se calar ""to be quiet"", tombar/caire ""to fall"", p(l)us/mai ""more"", totjorn/sempre ""always"", etc.). Nonetheless, there is a significant amount of mutual intelligibility.\nThe long-term survival of Occitan is in grave doubt. According to the UNESCO Red Book of Endangered Languages, four of the six major dialects of Occitan (Proven\u00e7al, Auvergnat, Limousin and Languedocien) are considered severely endangered, whereas the remaining two (Gascon and Vivaro-Alpine) are considered definitely endangered.","wikipedia","5.10"
"3.469","Occupy Wall Street","","Occupy Wall Street (OWS) was a protest movement that began on September 17, 2011, in Zuccotti Park, located in New York City's Wall Street financial district, against economic inequality.The Canadian anti-consumerist and pro-environment group/magazine Adbusters initiated the call for a protest. The main issues raised by Occupy Wall Street were social and economic inequality, greed, corruption and the undue influence of corporations on government\u2014particularly from the financial services sector. The OWS slogan, ""We are the 99%"", refers to income and wealth inequality in the U.S. between the wealthiest 1% and the rest of the population. To achieve their goals, protesters acted on consensus-based decisions made in general assemblies which emphasized redress through direct action over the petitioning to authorities.The protesters were forced out of Zuccotti Park on November 15, 2011. Protesters turned their focus to occupying banks, corporate headquarters, board meetings, foreclosed homes, and college and university campuses.","wikipedia","5.5"

"3.473","Olympics","","The modern Olympic Games or Olympics (French: Jeux olympiques) are leading international sporting events featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions. The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating. The Olympic Games are held every four years, with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.\nTheir creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games (Ancient Greek: \u1f48\u03bb\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03af \u1f08\u03b3\u1ff6\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2), which were held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894, leading to the first modern Games in Athens in 1896. The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement, with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority.\nThe evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for snow and ice sports, the Paralympic Games for athletes with a disability, the Youth Olympic Games for athletes aged 14 to 18, the five Continental games (Pan American, African, Asian, European, and Pacific), and the World Games for sports that are not contested in the Olympic Games. The Deaflympics and Special Olympics are also endorsed by the IOC. The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic, political, and technological advancements. The abuse of amateur rules by the Eastern Bloc nations prompted the IOC to shift away from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin, to allowing participation of professional athletes. The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialisation of the Games. World wars led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Games. Large boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Games.The Olympic Movement consists of international sports federations (IFs), National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and organising committees for each specific Olympic Games. As the decision-making body, the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each Games, and organises and funds the Games according to the Olympic Charter. The IOC also determines the Olympic programme, consisting of the sports to be contested at the Games. There are several Olympic rituals and symbols, such as the Olympic flag and torch, as well as the opening and closing ceremonies. Over 14,000 athletes competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics and 2018 Winter Olympics combined, in 35 different sports and over 400 events. The first, second, and third-place finishers in each event receive Olympic medals: gold, silver, and bronze, respectively.\nThe Games have grown so much that nearly every nation is now represented. This growth has created numerous challenges and controversies, including boycotts, doping, bribery, and a terrorist attack in 1972. Every two years the Olympics and its media exposure provide athletes with the chance to attain national and sometimes international fame. The Games also constitute an opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to the world.","wikipedia","5.11"
"3.474","Operation Wetback","","Operation Wetback was an immigration law enforcement initiative created by Joseph Swing, the Director of the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), in cooperation with the Mexican government. The program was implemented in May 1954 by U.S. Attorney General Herbert Brownell.  The short-lived operation used military-style tactics to remove Mexican immigrants\u2014some of them American citizens\u2014from the United States. Though millions of Mexicans had legally entered the country through joint immigration programs in the first half of the 20th century, Operation Wetback was designed to send them back to Mexico. The program became a contentious issue in Mexico\u2013United States relations, even though it originated from a request by the Mexican government to stop the illegal entry of Mexican laborers into the United States. Legal entry of Mexican workers for employment was at the time controlled by the Bracero program, established during World War II by an agreement between the U.S. and Mexican governments. Operation Wetback was primarily a response to pressure from a broad coalition of farmers and business interests concerned with the effects of Mexican immigrants living in the United States without legal permission. Upon implementation, Operation Wetback gave rise to arrests and deportations by the U.S. Border Patrol.\n\n","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.475","Opus Dei","","Opus Dei, formally known as the Prelature of the Holy Cross and Opus Dei (Latin: Praelatura Sanctae Crucis et Operis Dei), is an institution of the Catholic Church which teaches that everyone is called to holiness and that ordinary life is a path to sanctity. The majority of its membership are lay people; the remainder are secular priests under the governance of a prelate elected by specific members and appointed by the Pope. Opus Dei is Latin for ""Work of God""; hence the organization is often referred to by members and supporters as the Work.Opus Dei was founded in Spain in 1928 by Catholic saint and priest Josemar\u00eda Escriv\u00e1 and was given final Catholic Church approval in 1950 by Pope Pius XII. John Paul II made it a personal prelature in 1982 by the apostolic constitution Ut sit; that is, the jurisdiction of its own bishop covers the persons in Opus Dei wherever they are, rather than geographical dioceses.As of 2018, there were 95,318 members of the Prelature: 93,203 lay persons and 2,115 priests. These figures do not include the diocesan priest members of Opus Dei's Priestly Society of the Holy Cross, estimated to number 2,000 in the year 2005. Members are in more than 90 countries. About 70% of Opus Dei members live in their private homes, leading traditional Catholic family lives with secular careers, while the other 30% are celibate, of whom the majority live in Opus Dei centers. Aside from their personal charity and social work, Opus Dei members organize training in Catholic spirituality applied to daily life; members are involved in running universities, university residences, schools, publishing houses, hospitals, and technical and agricultural training centers.\nOpus Dei has been described as the most controversial force within the Catholic Church, especially as a result of their close ties with the fascist Franco regime in Spain during his rule from 1936 to 1975. Defenders of the organization argue that many of the negative claims about Opus Dei are unproven or fabrications.","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.476","Oral sex","","Oral sex, sometimes referred to as oral intercourse, is sexual activity involving the stimulation of the genitalia of a person by another person using the mouth (including the lips, tongue, or teeth) and the throat. Cunnilingus is oral sex performed on the vulva or vagina, while fellatio is oral sex performed on the penis. Anilingus, another form of oral sex, is oral stimulation of the anus. Oral stimulation of other parts of the body, such as by kissing or licking, is not considered oral sex.\nOral sex may be performed as foreplay to incite sexual arousal before other sexual activities (such as vaginal or anal intercourse), or as an erotic and physically intimate act in its own right. Like most forms of sexual activity, oral sex can pose a risk for contracting sexually transmitted infections (STIs/STDs). However, the transmission risk for oral sex, especially HIV transmission, is significantly lower than for vaginal or anal sex.Oral sex is often regarded as taboo, but most countries do not have laws which ban the practice. Commonly, people do not regard oral sex as affecting the virginity of either partner, though opinions on the matter vary. People may also have negative feelings or sexual inhibitions about giving or receiving oral sex, or may flatly refuse to engage in the practice.","wikipedia","5.7"
"3.477","Organ donor","","Organ donation is the process when a person allows an organ of their own to be removed and transplanted to another person, legally, either by consent while the donor is alive or dead with the assent of the next of kin.\nDonation may be for research or, more commonly, healthy transplantable organs and tissues may be donated to be transplanted into another person.Common transplantations include kidneys, heart, liver, pancreas, intestines, lungs, bones, bone marrow, skin, and corneas. Some organs and tissues can be donated by living donors, such as a kidney or part of the liver, part of the pancreas, part of the lungs or part of the intestines, but most donations occur after the donor has died.In 2017 Spain had the highest donor rate in the world at 46.9 per million people, followed by Portugal (34.0 per million), Belgium (33.6 per million), Croatia (33.0 per million) and the US (32.0 per million).As of February 2, 2019, there were 120,000 people waiting for life-saving organ transplants in the US. Of these, 74,897 people were active candidates waiting for a donor. While views of organ donation are positive, there is a large gap between the numbers of registered donors compared to those awaiting organ donations on a global level.To increase the number of organ donors, especially among underrepresented populations, current approaches include the use of optimized social network interventions, exposing tailored educational content about organ donation to target social media users.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.478","Orgasm","","Orgasm (from Greek \u1f40\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 orgasmos ""excitement, swelling""; also sexual climax) is the sudden discharge of accumulated sexual excitement during the sexual response cycle, resulting in rhythmic muscular contractions in the pelvic region characterized by sexual pleasure. Experienced by males and females, orgasms are controlled by the involuntary or autonomic nervous system. They are often associated with other involuntary actions, including muscular spasms in multiple areas of the body, a general euphoric sensation and, frequently, body movements and vocalizations. The period after orgasm (known as the refractory period) is often a relaxing experience, attributed to the release of the neurohormones oxytocin and prolactin as well as endorphins (or ""endogenous morphine"").Human orgasms usually result from physical sexual stimulation of the penis in males (typically accompanying ejaculation) and of the clitoris in females. Sexual stimulation can be by self-practice (masturbation) or with a sex partner (penetrative sex, non-penetrative sex, or other sexual activity).\nThe health effects surrounding the human orgasm are diverse. There are many physiological responses during sexual activity, including a relaxed state created by prolactin, as well as changes in the central nervous system such as a temporary decrease in the metabolic activity of large parts of the cerebral cortex while there is no change or increased metabolic activity in the limbic (i.e., ""bordering"") areas of the brain. There is also a wide range of sexual dysfunctions, such as anorgasmia. These effects impact cultural views of orgasm, such as the beliefs that orgasm and the frequency/consistency of it are either important or irrelevant for satisfaction in a sexual relationship, and theories about the biological and evolutionary functions of orgasm.","wikipedia","5.7"

He was a Saudi Arabian citizen until 1994 (stateless thereafter) and a member of the wealthy bin Laden family.Bin Laden's father was Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire from Hadhramaut, Yemen, and the founder of the construction company, Saudi Binladin Group. His mother, Alia Ghanem, was from a secular middle-class family based in Latakia, Syria. He was born in Saudi Arabia and studied at university in the country until 1979, when he joined Mujahideen forces in Pakistan fighting against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. He helped to fund the Mujahideen by funneling arms, money and fighters from the Arab world into Afghanistan, and gained popularity among many Arabs. In 1988, he formed al-Qaeda. He was banished from Saudi Arabia in 1992, and shifted his base to Sudan, until U.S. pressure forced him to leave Sudan in 1996. After establishing a new base in Afghanistan, he declared a war against the United States, initiating a series of bombings and related attacks. Bin Laden was on the American Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) lists of Ten Most Wanted Fugitives and Most Wanted Terrorists for his involvement in the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings.Bin Laden is most well known for his role in masterminding the September 11 attacks, which resulted in the deaths of nearly 3,000 and prompted the United States to initiate the War on Terror. He subsequently became the subject of a decade-long international manhunt. From 2001 to 2011, bin Laden was a major target of the United States, as the FBI offered a $25 million bounty in their search for him. On May 2, 2011, bin Laden was shot and killed by US Navy SEALs inside a private residential compound in Abbottabad, where he lived with a local family from Waziristan.  The covert operation was conducted by members of the United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group (SEAL Team Six) and Central Intelligence Agency SAD/SOG operators on the orders of U.S. President Barack Obama. Under his leadership, the al-Qaeda organization was responsible for, in addition to the September 11 attacks in the United States, many other mass-casualty attacks worldwide.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.480","Other Losses","","Other Losses is a 1989 book by Canadian writer James Bacque, alleging that U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower intentionally caused the deaths by starvation or exposure of around a million German prisoners of war held in Western internment camps briefly after the Second World War. Other Losses charges that hundreds of thousands of German prisoners that had fled the Eastern front were designated as ""Disarmed Enemy Forces"" in order to avoid recognition under the Geneva Convention (1929), for the purpose of carrying out their deaths through disease or slow starvation. Other Losses cites documents in the U.S. National Archives and interviews with people who stated they witnessed the events. The book claims that a ""method of genocide"" was present in the banning of Red Cross inspectors, the returning of food aid, soldier ration policy, and policy regarding shelter building.\nStephen Ambrose, a historian enlisted by Eisenhower in efforts to preserve his legacy and counteract criticisms of his presidency, and seven other American historians examined the book soon after its publication and concluded that it was inaccurate and the product of conspiracy theory. Other historians, including the former senior historian of the United States Army Center of Military History, Colonel Ernest F. Fisher, who was involved in the 1945 investigations into the allegations of misconduct by U.S. troops in Germany and who wrote the book's foreword, argue that the claims are accurate.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.481","Ovarian cancer","","Ovarian cancer is a cancer that forms in or on an ovary. It results in abnormal cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. When this process begins, there may be no or only vague symptoms. Symptoms become more noticeable as the cancer progresses. These symptoms may include bloating, pelvic pain, abdominal swelling, and loss of appetite, among others. Common areas to which the cancer may spread include the lining of the abdomen, lymph nodes, lungs, and liver.The risk of ovarian cancer increases in women who have ovulated more over their lifetime. This includes those who have never had children, those who begin ovulation at a younger age and those who reach menopause at an older age. Other risk factors include hormone therapy after menopause, fertility medication, and obesity. Factors that decrease risk include hormonal birth control, tubal ligation, and breast feeding. About 10% of cases are related to inherited genetic risk; women with mutations in the genes BRCA1 or BRCA2 have about a 50% chance of developing the disease. Ovarian carcinoma is the most common type of ovarian cancer, comprising more than 95% of cases. There are five main subtypes of ovarian carcinoma, of which high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most common. These tumors are believed to start in the cells covering the ovaries, though some may form at the Fallopian tubes. Less common types of ovarian cancer include germ cell tumors and sex cord stromal tumors. A diagnosis of ovarian cancer is confirmed through a biopsy of tissue, usually removed during surgery.Screening is not recommended in women who are at average risk, as evidence does not support a reduction in death and the high rate of false positive tests may lead to unneeded surgery, which is accompanied by its own risks. Those at very high risk may have their ovaries removed as a preventive measure. If caught and treated in an early stage, ovarian cancer is often curable. Treatment usually includes some combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Outcomes depend on the extent of the disease, the subtype of cancer present, and other medical conditions. The overall five-year survival rate in the United States is 45%. Outcomes are worse in the developing world.In 2012, new cases occurred in approximately 239,000 women. In 2015 it was present in 1.2 million women and resulted in 161,100 deaths worldwide.  Among women it is the seventh-most common cancer and the eighth-most common cause of death from cancer. The typical age of diagnosis is 63. Death from ovarian cancer is more common in North America and Europe than in Africa and Asia.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.482","Overpopulation","","Overpopulation occurs when a species' population exceeds the carrying capacity of its ecological niche. It can result from an increase in births (fertility rate), a decline in the mortality rate, an increase in immigration, or an unsustainable biome and depletion of resources. When overpopulation occurs, individuals limit available resources to survive.The change in number of individuals per unit area in a given locality is an important variable that has a significant impact on the entire ecosystem.\n\n","wikipedia","['5.8','5.9']"
"3.483","Ozone depletion","","Ozone depletion consists of two related events observed since the late 1970s: a steady lowering of about four percent in the total amount of ozone in Earth's atmosphere (the ozone layer), and a much larger springtime decrease in stratospheric ozone around Earth's polar regions. The latter phenomenon is referred to as the ozone hole. There are also springtime polar tropospheric ozone depletion events in addition to these stratospheric events.\nIn 2019, NASA announced the ""ozone hole"" was the smallest ever since it was first discovered in 1982.The main cause of ozone depletion and the ozone hole is manufactured chemicals, especially manufactured halocarbon refrigerants, solvents, propellants and foam-blowing agents (chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), HCFCs, halons), referred to as ozone-depleting substances (ODS). These compounds are transported into the stratosphere by turbulent mixing after being emitted from the surface, mixing much faster than the molecules can settle. Once in the stratosphere, they release halogen atoms through photodissociation, which catalyze the breakdown of ozone (O3) into oxygen (O2). Both types of ozone depletion were observed to increase as emissions of halocarbons increased.\nOzone depletion and the ozone hole have generated worldwide concern over increased cancer risks and other negative effects. The ozone layer prevents most harmful UV wavelengths of ultraviolet light (UV light) from passing through the Earth's atmosphere. These wavelengths cause skin cancer, sunburn and cataracts, which were projected to increase dramatically as a result of thinning ozone, as well as harming plants and animals. These concerns led to the adoption of the Montreal Protocol in 1987, which bans the production of CFCs, halons and other ozone-depleting chemicals.\nThe ban came into effect in 1989. Ozone levels stabilized by the mid-1990s and began to recover in the 2000s. Recovery is projected to continue over the next century, and the ozone hole is expected to reach pre-1980 levels by around 2075. The Montreal Protocol is considered the most successful international environmental agreement to date.\n\n","wikipedia","5.9"
"3.485","Pacifism","","Pacifism is opposition to war, militarism or violence. The word pacifism was coined by the French peace campaigner \u00c9mile Arnaud (1864\u20131921) and adopted by other peace activists at the tenth Universal Peace Congress in Glasgow in 1901. A related term is ahimsa (to do no harm), which is a core philosophy in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. While modern connotations are recent, having been explicated since the 19th century, ancient references abound.\nIn modern times, interest was revived by Leo Tolstoy in his late works, particularly in The Kingdom of God Is Within You. Mohandas Gandhi (1869\u20131948) propounded the practice of steadfast nonviolent opposition which he called ""satyagraha"", instrumental in its role in the Indian Independence Movement. Its effectiveness served as inspiration to Martin Luther King Jr., James Lawson, Mary and Charles Beard, James Bevel, Thich Nhat Hanh and many others in the civil rights movement.\n\n","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.486","Paganism","","Paganism (from classical Latin p\u0101g\u0101nus ""rural, rustic,"" later ""civilian"") is a term first used in the fourth century by early Christians for people in the Roman Empire who practiced polytheism. This was either because they were increasingly rural and provincial relative to the Christian population, or because they were not milites Christi (soldiers of Christ). Alternate terms in Christian texts for the same group were hellene, gentile, and heathen. Ritual sacrifice was an integral part of ancient Graeco-Roman religion and was regarded as an indication of whether a person was pagan or Christian.Paganism was originally a pejorative and derogatory term for polytheism, implying its inferiority. Paganism has broadly connoted the ""religion of the peasantry"". During and after the Middle Ages, the term paganism was applied to any unfamiliar religion, and the term presumed a belief in false god(s). Most modern pagan religions existing today (Modern or Neopaganism) express a world view that is pantheistic, polytheistic or animistic; but some are monotheistic.The origin of the application of the term pagan to polytheism is debated. In the 19th century, paganism was adopted as a self-descriptor by members of various artistic groups inspired by the ancient world. In the 20th century, it came to be applied as a self-descriptor by practitioners of Modern Paganism, Neopagan movements and Polytheistic reconstructionists. Modern pagan traditions often incorporate beliefs or practices, such as nature worship, that are different from those in the largest world religions.Contemporary knowledge of old pagan religions comes from several sources, including anthropological field research records, the evidence of archaeological artifacts, and the historical accounts of ancient writers regarding cultures known to Classical antiquity.","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.487","Pakkoruotsi","","In Finland, Swedish is a mandatory school subject for Finnish-speaking pupils in the last four years of the primary education (grades 6 to 9). This so-called other domestic language is also mandatory in high schools, vocational schools, and vocational universities. Furthermore, all university graduates must demonstrate a certain level of proficiency in Swedish (the so-called public servant's Swedish). Altogether 89% of Finnish citizens are native Finnish speakers, whereas 5.3% of the population report Swedish as their mother tongue. Currently, it is possible for Finnish citizens to report a different mother tongue for themselves at any time, and as many times as desired, by submitting a form to the Population Register Center.\nAccording to the Finnish constitution, both Finnish and Swedish are national languages. The employees of the national government and the bilingual municipal governments are required to be able to serve citizens in Swedish. Military service is not required in the autonomous region of \u00c5land. The official term for both mandatory Swedish and Finnish is the other domestic language. However, the requirement to study Swedish is often referred to as pakkoruotsi, a somewhat charged term in Finnish meaning ""mandatory Swedish"", or ""enforced Swedish"".","wikipedia","5.5"

It is recognized as the ""sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people"" by over 100 states with which it holds diplomatic relations, and has enjoyed observer status at the United Nations since 1974. The PLO was considered by the United States and Israel to be a terrorist organization until the Madrid Conference in 1991. In 1993, the PLO recognized Israel's right to exist in peace, accepted UN Security Council resolutions 242 and 338, and rejected ""violence and terrorism"". In response, Israel officially recognized the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people. However, the PLO has employed violence in the years since 1993, particularly during the 2000\u20132005 Second Intifada. On 29 October 2018, the Palestinian Central Council suspended the recognition of Israel and halted security and economic coordination in all its forms with it.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.490","Panama Canal","","The Panama Canal (Spanish: Canal de Panam\u00e1) is an artificial 82 km (51 mi) waterway in Panama that connects the Atlantic Ocean with the Pacific Ocean. The canal cuts across the Isthmus of Panama and is a conduit for maritime trade.  Canal locks are at each end to lift ships up to Gatun Lake, an artificial lake created to reduce the amount of excavation work required for the canal, 26 m (85 ft) above sea level, and then lower the ships at the other end. The original locks are 32.5 m (110 ft) wide. A third, wider lane of locks was constructed between September 2007 and May 2016. The expanded canal began commercial operation on June 26, 2016. The new locks allow transit of larger, neo-Panamax ships, capable of handling more cargo.The construction of the Panama Canal is where the expression ""Another Day, Another Dollar"" comes from, as the workers were rumored to be paid a dollar a day for their labor.France began work on the canal in 1881, but stopped because of engineering problems and a high worker mortality rate. The United States took over the project in 1904 and opened the canal on August 15, 1914. One of the largest and most difficult engineering projects ever undertaken, the Panama Canal shortcut greatly reduced the time for ships to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, enabling them to avoid the lengthy, hazardous Cape Horn route around the southernmost tip of South America via the Drake Passage or Strait of Magellan and the even less popular route through the Arctic Archipelago and the Bering Strait.\nColombia, France, and later the United States controlled the territory surrounding the canal during construction. The US continued to control the canal and surrounding Panama Canal Zone until the 1977 Torrijos\u2013Carter Treaties provided for handover to Panama. After a period of joint American\u2013Panamanian control, in 1999, the canal was taken over by the Panamanian government. It is now managed and operated by the government-owned Panama Canal Authority.\nAnnual traffic has risen from about 1,000 ships in 1914, when the canal opened, to 14,702 vessels in 2008, for a total of 333.7 million Panama Canal/Universal Measurement System (PC/UMS) tons. By 2012, more than 815,000 vessels had passed through the canal. It takes 11.38 hours to pass through the Panama Canal. The American Society of Civil Engineers has ranked the Panama Canal one of the seven wonders of the modern world.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.491","Paraphilia","","Paraphilia (previously known as sexual perversion and sexual deviation) is the experience of intense sexual arousal to atypical objects, situations, fantasies, behaviors, or individuals.No consensus has been found for any precise border between unusual sexual interests and paraphilic ones. There is debate over which, if any, of the paraphilias should be listed in diagnostic manuals, such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD).\nThe number and taxonomy of paraphilia is under debate; one source lists as many as 549 types of paraphilia. The DSM-5 has specific listings for eight paraphilic disorders. Several sub-classifications of the paraphilias have been proposed, and some argue that a fully dimensional, spectrum or complaint-oriented approach would better reflect the evidence.","wikipedia","5.7"
"3.492","Park51","","Park51 (originally named Cordoba House) is a development that was originally envisioned as a 13-story Islamic community center and mosque in Lower Manhattan. New York City. The developers hoped to promote an interfaith dialogue within the greater community. Due to its proposed location two blocks from the World Trade Center site, it was widely and controversially referred to as the ""Ground Zero mosque"".The project would replace an existing 1850s building of Italianate style that was damaged in the September 11 attacks. The original design was by Michel Abboud, principal of SOMA Architects, who wrestled for months with the challenge of making the building fit naturally into its lower Manhattan surroundings: on the one hand, it should have a contemporary design, and, at the same time, it should look Islamic. His design included a 500-seat auditorium, theater, performing arts center, fitness center, swimming pool, basketball court, childcare area, bookstore, culinary school, art studio, food court, and memorial to the victims of the September 11 attacks. It also included a prayer space for the Muslim community, which would accommodate 1,000\u20132,000 people.\nIn late September 2011, a temporary 4,000-square-foot (370 m2) Islamic center opened in renovated space at the Park51 location. In summer 2014, it was announced that there would instead be a 3-story museum with a prayer space, as well as condos, at 49-51 Park Place. The plans were changed again in September 2015, when the owner announced a 667-foot (203 m), 70-story luxury condominium building at the site. In May 2016, financing was secured for a 43-story condominium building with room for an Islamic cultural museum adjacent to it. \nThe condominium building, called 45 Park Place, started construction in 2017 and was nearly completed by 2019.

"3.495","Paul and Gnosticism","","Gnosticism (from Ancient Greek: \u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 gn\u014dstik\u00f3s, Koine Greek: [\u0261\u02e0no\u031es.ti\u02c8kos], ""having knowledge"") is a collection of ancient religious ideas and systems which originated in the first century AD among early Christian and Jewish sects. These various groups, labeled ""Gnostics"" by their opponents, emphasised personal spiritual knowledge (gnosis) over orthodox teachings, traditions, and ecclesiastical authority. They considered the principal element of salvation to be direct knowledge of the supreme divinity, experienced as mystical or esoteric insight. Generally, Gnostic cosmogony presents a distinction between this supreme, hidden God and a blind, evil demiurge responsible for creating the material universe, thereby trapping the divine spark within matter. Many Gnostic texts deal not in concepts of sin and repentance, but with illusion and enlightenment.Gnostic writings flourished among certain Christian groups in the Mediterranean world until about the second century, when the Fathers of the early church denounced them as heresy. Efforts to destroy supposedly heretical texts proved largely successful, resulting in the survival of very few Gnostic texts. Nonetheless, early Gnostic teachers such as Valentinus saw their beliefs as aligned with Christianity. In the Gnostic Christian tradition, Christ is seen as a divine being which has taken human form in order to lead humanity back to the Light. However, Gnosticism is not a single standardized system, and the emphasis on direct experience allows for a wide variety of teachings, including distinct currents such as Valentianism and Sethianism. In the Persian Empire, Gnostic ideas spread as far as China via the related movement Manichaeism, while Mandaeism is still alive in Iraq.\nFor centuries, most scholarly knowledge of Gnosticism was limited to the anti-heretical writings of orthodox Christian figures such as Irenaeus of Lyons and Hippolytus of Rome. Renewed interest in Gnosticism occurred after the 1945 discovery of Egypt's Nag Hammadi library, a collection of rare early Christian and Gnostic texts, including the Gospel of Thomas and the Apocryphon of John. A major question in scholarly research is the qualification of Gnosticism as either an interreligious phenomenon or as an independent religion. Scholars have acknowledged the influence of sources such as Hellenistic Judaism and Platonism, and some have noted possible links to Buddhism and Hinduism, though the evidence of direct influence from these latter sources is inconclusive.","wikipedia","5.1"

In Canada, the series is primarily broadcast on TVOntario, which first ran previews of the show in August 2013. The series premiered on Nickelodeon in the United States on August 12, 2013.\nThe series focuses on a young boy named Ryder who leads a crew of search and rescue dogs that call themselves the PAW Patrol. They work together on missions to protect the shoreside community of Adventure Bay. Each dog has a specific set of skills based on emergency services professions, such as a firefighter, a police officer, and an aviation pilot. They all reside in doghouses that transform into customized vehicles for their missions. They are also equipped with backpacks called ""pup packs"" that contain tools that relate to the pups' jobs.\nSpin Master has developed the show into a media franchise and released an ongoing line of toys based on it. PAW Patrol toy sales have generated millions of dollars in revenue for the corporation and increased Spin Master's presence in the preschool toy market. The show, and its associated products, have received a variety of awards and nominations from associations such as the Academy of Canadian Cinema & Television and the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences.\nOn June 4, 2019, the series was renewed for a seventh season of 26 half hour episodes. In the United States, select episodes are available to stream on Noggin, for free with TV Everywhere authentication on Nickelodeon's app and with a public library card through the Hoopla app.\nOn February 19, 2020, the series was renewed for an eighth season of 26 half hour episodes.\n\n","wikipedia","5.13"
"3.497","Pederasty","","Pederasty or paederasty (US:  or UK: ) is a sexual relationship between an adult man and a pubescent or adolescent boy. The term pederasty is primarily used to refer to historical practices of certain cultures, particularly ancient Greece and ancient Rome.\nIn most countries today, the local age of consent determines whether a person is considered legally competent to consent to sexual acts, and whether such contact is child sexual abuse or statutory rape. An adult engaging in sexual activity with a minor may be considered abusive by medical authorities for a variety of reasons, including the age of the minor, the likelihood of the minor developing one or more mental disorders, such as posttraumatic stress disorder, physical injury to the minor, and the minor's propensity for further victimization in adulthood.","wikipedia","5.7"
"3.498","Pedophilia","","Pedophilia (alternatively spelt paedophilia) is a psychiatric disorder in which an adult or older adolescent experiences a primary or exclusive sexual attraction to prepubescent children. Although girls typically begin the process of puberty at age 10 or 11, and boys at age 11 or 12, criteria for pedophilia extend the cut-off point for prepubescence to age 13. A person must be at least 16 years old, and at least five years older than the prepubescent child, for the attraction to be diagnosed as pedophilia.Pedophilia is termed pedophilic disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), and the manual defines it as a paraphilia involving intense and recurrent sexual urges towards and fantasies about prepubescent children that have either been acted upon or which cause the person with the attraction distress or interpersonal difficulty. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) defines it as a ""sustained, focused, and intense pattern of sexual arousal\u2014as manifested by persistent sexual thoughts, fantasies, urges, or behaviours\u2014involving pre-pubertal children.""In popular usage, the word pedophilia is often applied to any sexual interest in children or the act of child sexual abuse. This use conflates the sexual attraction to prepubescent children with the act of child sexual abuse and fails to distinguish between attraction to prepubescent and pubescent or post-pubescent minors. Researchers recommend that these imprecise uses be avoided, because although some people who commit child sexual abuse are pedophiles, child sexual abuse offenders are not pedophiles unless they have a primary or exclusive sexual interest in prepubescent children, and some pedophiles do not molest children.Pedophilia was first formally recognized and named in the late 19th century. A significant amount of research in the area has taken place since the 1980s. Although mostly documented in men, there are also women who exhibit the disorder, and researchers assume available estimates underrepresent the true number of female pedophiles. No cure for pedophilia has been developed, but there are therapies that can reduce the incidence of a person committing child sexual abuse. The exact causes of pedophilia have not been conclusively established. Some studies of pedophilia in child sex offenders have correlated it with various neurological abnormalities and psychological pathologies. In the United States, following Kansas v. Hendricks in 1997, sex offenders who are diagnosed with certain mental disorders, particularly pedophilia, can be subject to indefinite involuntary commitment.","wikipedia","5.7"
"3.499","Peer-to-peer file sharing","","Peer-to-peer file sharing is the distribution and sharing of digital media using peer-to-peer (P2P) networking technology. P2P file sharing allows users to access media files such as books, music, movies, and games using a P2P software program that searches for other connected computers on a P2P network to locate the desired content. The nodes (peers) of such networks are end-user computers and distribution servers (not required).\nPeer-to-peer file sharing technology has evolved through several design stages from the early networks like Napster, which popularized the technology, to the later models like the BitTorrent protocol. Microsoft uses it for Update distribution (Windows 10) and online playing games (e.g. the mmorpg Skyforge) use it as their content distribution network for downloading large amounts of data without incurring the dramatic costs for bandwidth inherent when providing just a single source.\nSeveral factors contributed to the widespread adoption and facilitation of peer-to-peer file sharing. These included increasing Internet bandwidth, the widespread digitization of physical media, and the increasing capabilities of residential personal computers. Users are able to transfer one or more files from one computer to another across the Internet through various file transfer systems and other file-sharing networks.","wikipedia","5.4"

The papers were released by Daniel Ellsberg, who had worked on the study; they were first brought to the attention of the public on the front page of The New York Times in 1971. A 1996 article in The New York Times said that the Pentagon Papers had demonstrated, among other things, that the Johnson Administration ""systematically lied, not only to the public but also to Congress.""More specifically, the papers revealed that the U.S. had secretly enlarged the scope of its actions in the Vietnam War with the bombings of nearby Cambodia and Laos, coastal raids on North Vietnam, as well as Marine Corps attacks, none of which were reported in the mainstream media. For his disclosure of the Pentagon Papers, Ellsberg was initially charged with conspiracy, espionage, and theft of government property, but the charges were later dismissed after prosecutors investigating the Watergate scandal discovered that the staff members in the Nixon White House had ordered the so-called White House Plumbers to engage in unlawful efforts to discredit Ellsberg.In June 2011, the entirety of the Pentagon Papers was declassified and publicly released.","wikipedia","5.13"
"3.501","Pentecostalism","","Pentecostalism or Classical Pentecostalism is a Protestant Christian movement that emphasises direct personal experience of God through baptism with the Holy Spirit. The term Pentecostal is derived from Pentecost, the Greek name for the Jewish Feast of Weeks. For Christians, this event commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the followers of Jesus Christ, as described in the second chapter of the Acts of the Apostles.\nLike other forms of evangelical Protestantism, Pentecostalism adheres to the inerrancy of the Bible and the necessity of accepting Jesus Christ as personal Lord and Savior. It is distinguished by belief in the baptism in the Holy Spirit that enables a Christian to live a Spirit-filled and empowered life. This empowerment includes the use of spiritual gifts such as speaking in tongues and divine healing\u2014two other defining characteristics of Pentecostalism. Because of their commitment to biblical authority, spiritual gifts, and the miraculous, Pentecostals tend to see their movement as reflecting the same kind of spiritual power and teachings that were found in the Apostolic Age of the early church. For this reason, some Pentecostals also use the term Apostolic or Full Gospel to describe their movement.\nPentecostalism emerged in the early 20th century among radical adherents of the Holiness movement who were energized by revivalism and expectation for the imminent Second Coming of Christ. Believing that they were living in the end times, they expected God to spiritually renew the Christian Church thereby bringing to pass the restoration of spiritual gifts and the evangelization of the world. In 1900, Charles Parham, an American evangelist and faith healer, began teaching that speaking in tongues was the Bible evidence of Spirit baptism and along with William J. Seymour, a Wesleyan-Holiness preacher, he taught that this was the third work of grace. The three-year-long Azusa Street Revival, founded and led by Seymour in Los Angeles, California, resulted in the spread of Pentecostalism throughout the United States and the rest of the world as visitors carried the Pentecostal experience back to their home churches or felt called to the mission field. While virtually all Pentecostal denominations trace their origins to Azusa Street, the movement has experienced a variety of divisions and controversies. An early dispute centered on challenges to the doctrine of the Trinity. As a result, the Pentecostal movement is divided between trinitarian and non-trinitarian branches, resulting in the emergence of Oneness Pentecostals.\nComprising over 700 denominations and many independent churches, there is no central authority governing Pentecostalism; however, many denominations are affiliated with the Pentecostal World Fellowship. There are over 279 million Pentecostals worldwide, and the movement is growing in many parts of the world, especially the global South. Since the 1960s, Pentecostalism has increasingly gained acceptance from other Christian traditions, and Pentecostal beliefs concerning Spirit baptism and spiritual gifts have been embraced by non-Pentecostal Christians in Protestant and Catholic churches through the Charismatic Movement. Together, Pentecostal and Charismatic Christianity numbers over 500 million adherents. While the movement originally attracted mostly lower classes in the global South, there is an increasing appeal to middle classes. Middle class congregations tend to be more adapted to society and withdraw strong spiritual practices such as divine healing.","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.502","People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals","","People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA ) is an American animal rights organization based in Norfolk, Virginia, and led by Ingrid Newkirk, its international president. A nonprofit corporation with nearly 400 employees, it claims that it has 6.5 million members and supporters, in addition to claiming that it is the ""largest animal rights group in the world."" Its slogan is ""Animals are not ours to eat, wear, experiment on, use for entertainment, or abuse in any other way.""Founded in March 1980 by Ingrid Newkirk and fellow animal rights activist Alex Pacheco, the organization first caught the public's attention in the summer of 1981 during what became known as the Silver Spring monkeys case, a widely publicized dispute about experiments conducted on 17 macaque monkeys inside the Institute of Behavioral Research in Silver Spring, Maryland. The case lasted 10 years, involved the only police raid on an animal laboratory in the United States, triggered an amendment in 1985 to that country's Animal Welfare Act, and established PETA as an internationally known organization. Today, it focuses on four core issues\u2014opposition to factory farming, fur farming, animal testing, and the use of animals in entertainment. It also campaigns for a vegan lifestyle and against eating meat, fishing, the killing of animals regarded as pests, the keeping of chained backyard dogs, cock fighting, dog fighting, beekeeping, and bullfighting.The group is the focus of controversy, both inside and outside the animal rights movement and around the world. Newkirk, and formerly Pacheco, are seen as the leading exporters of animal rights to the more traditional animal-protection groups in the United States, but sections of the movement nonetheless say that PETA is not radical enough\u2014law professor Gary Francione lists the group among what he calls ""the new welfarists,"" arguing that its work with industries to achieve reform, which continues in the tradition of Henry Spira, makes it an animal welfare group, not an animal rights group. Newkirk told Salon in 2001 that PETA works toward the ideal but tries in the meantime to provide carrot-and-stick incentives. There has also been criticism from feminists within the movement about the use of scantily clad women in PETA's anti-fur campaigns and others, but as Norm Phelps notes, ""Newkirk has been consistent in her response. No one, she says, is being exploited. Everyone ... is an uncoerced volunteer. Sexual attraction is a fact of life, and if it can advance the animals' cause, she makes no apologies for using it."" Also, Phelps notes that some activists believe that the group's media stunts trivialize animal rights, but he qualifies this by saying, ""[I]t's hard to argue with success and PETA is far and away the most successful cutting-edge animal rights organization in the world."" Newkirk's view is that PETA has a duty to be self-proclaimed ""press sluts."" She argues, ""It is our obligation. We would be worthless if we were just polite and didn't make any waves.""","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.503","Petrol","","Gasoline (American English), or petrol (British English), is a clear petroleum-derived flammable liquid that is used primarily as a fuel in most spark-ignited internal combustion engines. It consists mostly of organic compounds obtained by the fractional distillation of petroleum, enhanced with a variety of additives. On average, a 42-U.S.-gallon (160-liter) barrel of  crude oil yields about 19 U.S. gallons (72 liters) of gasoline (among other refined products) after processing in an oil refinery, though this varies based on the crude oil assay.\nThe characteristic of a particular gasoline blend to resist igniting too early (which causes knocking and reduces efficiency in reciprocating engines) is measured by its octane rating which is produced in several grades. Tetraethyl lead and other lead compounds are no longer used in most areas to increase octane rating (still used in aviation and auto-racing). Other chemicals are frequently added to gasoline to improve chemical stability and performance characteristics, control corrosiveness and provide fuel system cleaning. Gasoline may contain oxygen-containing chemicals such as ethanol, MTBE or ETBE to improve combustion.\nGasoline used in internal combustion engines can have significant effects on the local environment, and is also a contributor to global human carbon dioxide emissions. Gasoline can also enter the environment uncombusted, both as liquid and as vapor, from leakage and handling during production, transport and delivery (e.g., from storage tanks, from spills, etc.). As an example of efforts to control such leakage, many underground storage tanks are required to have extensive measures in place to detect and prevent such leaks. Gasoline contains benzene and other known carcinogens.\n\n","wikipedia","5.9"

"3.509","Plame affair","","The Plame affair (also known as the CIA leak scandal and Plamegate) was a political scandal that revolved around journalist Robert Novak's public identification of Valerie Plame as a covert Central Intelligence Agency officer in 2003.In 2002, Plame wrote a memo to her superiors in which she expressed hesitation in recommending her husband, former diplomat Joseph C. Wilson, to the CIA for a mission to Niger to investigate claims that Iraq had arranged to purchase and import uranium from the country, but stated that he ""may be in a position to assist"". After President George W. Bush stated that ""Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa"" during the run-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Wilson published a July 2003 op-ed in The New York Times stating his doubts during the mission that any such transaction with Iraq had taken place.A week after Wilson's op-ed was published, Novak published a column which mentioned claims from ""two senior administration officials"" that Plame had been the one to suggest sending her husband. Novak had learned of Plame's employment, which was classified information, from State Department official Richard Armitage. David Corn and others suggested that Armitage and other officials had leaked the information as political retribution for Wilson's article.\nThe scandal led to a criminal investigation; no one was charged for the leak itself. Scooter Libby was convicted of lying to investigators. His prison sentence was ultimately commuted by President Bush, and he was pardoned by President Donald Trump in 2018.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.510","Plame affair timeline","","The Plame affair erupted in July 2003, when journalist Robert Novak revealed that Valerie Plame worked as covert employee of the Central Intelligence Agency, although the seeds of the scandal had been laid during 2001 and 2002 as the Bush administration investigated allegations that Iraq had purchased Nigerien uranium.\nBetween 2003 and 2007, Patrick Fitzgerald led a criminal investigation into allegations that the Bush administration had leaked Plame's identity as retribution against her husband, Joseph C. Wilson, who had publicly questioned the rationale for the Iraq War. In August 2006, former U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage revealed that he had been Novak's primary source for the leak.\nBy July 2007, when President George W. Bush commuted the prison sentence Scooter Libby had received for perjury and obstruction of justice during Fitzgerald's investigation of the leak, the scandal had largely come to a close. In April 2018, President Donald Trump fully pardoned Libby.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.511","Plato","","Plato (; PLAY-toe Greek: \u03a0\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd Pl\u00e1t\u014dn, pronounced [pl\u00e1.t\u0254\u02d0n] in Classical Attic; 428/427 or 424/423 \u2013 348/347 BC) was an Athenian philosopher during the Classical period in Ancient Greece, founder of the Platonist school of thought, and the Academy, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world.\nHe is widely considered the pivotal figure in the history of Ancient Greek and Western philosophy, along with his teacher, Socrates, and his most famous student, Aristotle. Plato has also often been cited as one of the founders of Western religion and spirituality. The so-called Neoplatonism of philosophers like Plotinus and Porphyry influenced Saint Augustine and thus Christianity. Alfred North Whitehead once noted: ""the safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato.""Plato was the innovator of the written dialogue and dialectic forms in philosophy. Plato is also considered the founder of Western political philosophy. His most famous contribution is the theory of Forms known by pure reason, in which Plato presents a solution to the problem of universals known as Platonism (also ambiguously called either Platonic realism or Platonic idealism). He is also the namesake of Platonic love and the Platonic solids.\nHis own most decisive philosophical influences are usually thought to have been along with Socrates, the pre-Socratics Pythagoras, Heraclitus and Parmenides, although few of his predecessors' works remain extant and much of what we know about these figures today derives from Plato himself. Unlike the work of nearly all of his contemporaries, Plato's entire body of work is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years. Although their popularity has fluctuated over the years, the works of Plato have never been without readers since the time they were written.","wikipedia","5.2"
"3.512","Playboy Magazine","","Playboy is an American men's lifestyle and entertainment magazine. It was founded in Chicago in 1953, by Hugh Hefner and his associates, and funded in part by a $1,000 loan from Hefner's mother.  Notable for its centerfolds of nude and semi-nude models (Playmates), Playboy played an important role in the sexual revolution and remains one of the world's best-known brands, having grown into Playboy Enterprises, Inc. (PEI), with a presence in nearly every medium. In addition to the flagship magazine in the United States, special nation-specific versions of Playboy are published worldwide.\nThe magazine has a long history of publishing short stories by novelists such as Arthur C. Clarke, Ian Fleming, Vladimir Nabokov, Saul Bellow, Chuck Palahniuk, P. G. Wodehouse, Roald Dahl, Haruki Murakami, and Margaret Atwood. With a regular display of full-page color cartoons, it became a showcase for notable cartoonists, including Harvey Kurtzman, Jack Cole, Eldon Dedini, Jules Feiffer, Shel Silverstein, Erich Sokol, Roy Raymonde, Gahan Wilson, and Rowland B. Wilson. Playboy features monthly interviews of notable public figures, such as artists, architects, economists, composers, conductors, film directors, journalists, novelists, playwrights, religious figures, politicians, athletes, and race car drivers. The magazine generally reflects a liberal editorial stance, although it often interviews conservative celebrities.\n\nAfter a year-long removal of most nude photos in Playboy magazine, the March\u2013April 2017 issue brought back nudity.","wikipedia","5.12"
"3.513","Pluto","","Pluto (minor planet designation: 134340 Pluto) is an icy dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. It was the first Kuiper belt object to be discovered and is the largest known dwarf planet.\nPluto was discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930 as the ninth planet from the Sun. After 1992, its status as a planet was questioned following the discovery of several objects of similar size in the Kuiper belt. In 2005, Eris, a dwarf planet in the scattered disc which is 27% more massive than Pluto, was discovered. This led the International Astronomical Union (IAU) to define the term ""planet"" formally in 2006, during their 26th General Assembly. That definition excluded Pluto and reclassified it as a dwarf planet.\nIt is the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object directly orbiting the Sun. It is the largest known trans-Neptunian object by volume but is less massive than Eris. Like other Kuiper belt objects, Pluto is primarily made of ice and rock and is relatively small\u2014about one-sixth the mass of the Moon and one-third its volume. It has a moderately eccentric and inclined orbit during which it ranges from 30 to 49 astronomical units or AU (4.4\u20137.4 billion km) from the Sun. This means that Pluto periodically comes closer to the Sun than Neptune, but a stable orbital resonance with Neptune prevents them from colliding.  Light from the Sun takes about 5.5 hours to reach Pluto at its average distance (39.5 AU).\nPluto has five known moons: Charon (the largest, with a diameter just over half that of Pluto), Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra. Pluto and Charon are sometimes considered a binary system because the barycenter of their orbits does not lie within either body.\nThe New Horizons spacecraft performed a flyby of Pluto on July 14, 2015, becoming the first ever, and to date only, spacecraft to do so. During its brief flyby, New Horizons made detailed measurements and observations of Pluto and its moons. In September 2016, astronomers announced that the reddish-brown cap of the north pole of Charon is composed of tholins, organic macromolecules that may be ingredients for the emergence of life, and produced from methane, nitrogen and other gases released from the atmosphere of Pluto and transferred about 19,000 km (12,000 mi) to the orbiting moon.","wikipedia","5.8"

Over centuries, there have been several Polish\u2013Russian Wars, with Poland once occupying Moscow and later Russia controlling much of Poland in the 19th as well as in the 20th century, damaging relations. Polish\u2013Russian relations entered a new phase following the fall of communism, 1989\u20131993. Since then Polish\u2013Russian relations have at times seen both improvement and deterioration. According to a 2013 BBC World Service poll, 19 percent of Poles view Russia's influence positively while 49 percent express a negative view.\nHowever, since the Russian annexation of Crimea, over 60-80% Poles are worried over the future conflict with Russia, giving the fact Russia maintains control in Kaliningrad Oblast.","wikipedia","5.6"

The population of self-declared Poles in Poland is estimated at 37,394,000 out of an overall population of 38,538,000 (based on the 2011 census), of whom 36,522,000 declared Polish alone.A wide-ranging Polish diaspora (the Polonia) exists throughout Europe, the Americas, and in Australasia. Today, the largest urban concentrations of Poles are within the Warsaw and Silesian metropolitan areas.\nPoland's history dates back over a thousand years, to c. 930\u2013960 AD, when the Western Polans \u2013 an influential tribe in the Greater Poland region, now home to such cities as Pozna\u0144, Gniezno, Kalisz, Konin and Wrze\u015bnia \u2013 united various Lechitic clans under what became the Piast dynasty, thus creating the first Polish state. The subsequent Christianization of Poland by the Catholic Church, in 966 CE, marked Poland's advent to the community of Western Christendom. However, throughout its existence, the Polish state followed a tolerant policy towards minorities resulting in numerous ethnic and religious identities of the Poles, such as Polish Jews.\nPoles have made important contributions to the world in every major field of human endeavor, among them Copernicus, Marie Curie, Joseph Conrad, Fryderyk Chopin and Pope John Paul II.

"3.517","Political correctness","","Political correctness (adjectivally: politically correct; commonly abbreviated PC) is a term used to describe language, policies, or measures that are intended to avoid offense or disadvantage to members of particular groups in society. In public discourse and the media, the term is generally used as a pejorative with an implication that these policies are excessive or unwarranted.  Since the late 1980s,  the term has been used to describe a preference for inclusive language and avoiding language or behavior that can be seen as excluding, marginalizing, or insulting groups of people considered disadvantaged or discriminated against, especially groups defined by sex or race.\nEarly usage of the term politically correct by leftists in the 1970s and '80s was as self-critical satire; usage was ironic, rather than a name for a serious political movement. It was considered an in-joke among leftists used to satirise those who were too rigid in their adherence to political orthodoxy.The modern pejorative usage of the term emerged from conservative criticism of the New Left in the late 20th century. This usage was popularized by a number of articles in The New York Times and other media throughout the 1990s, and was widely used in the debate surrounding Allan Bloom's 1987 book The Closing of the American Mind.  The term gained further currency in response to Roger Kimball's Tenured Radicals (1990), and conservative author Dinesh D'Souza's 1991 book Illiberal Education.Commentators on the political left in the United States contend that conservatives use the concept of political correctness to downplay and divert attention from substantively discriminatory behavior against disadvantaged groups. They also argue that the political right enforces its own forms of political correctness to suppress criticism of its favored constituencies and ideologies. In the United States, the term has played a major role in the ""culture war"" between liberals and conservatives.\n\n","wikipedia","['5.5','5.13']"

Most of political parties have an ideological core, but some do not, and many represent ideologies very different from their ideology at the time the party was founded. Many countries, such as Germany and India, have several significant political parties, and some nations have one-party systems, such as China and Cuba.

"3.519","Political radicalism","","Radical politics denotes the intent to transform or replace the fundamental principles of a society or political system, often through social change, structural change, revolution or radical reform. The process of adopting radical views is termed radicalisation.\nThe word ""radical"" derives from the Latin radix (""root"") and Late Latin r\u0101d\u012bc\u0101lis (""of or pertaining to the root, radical""). Historically, political use of the term referred exclusively to a form of progressive electoral reformism, known as Radicalism, that had developed in Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries. However, the denotation has changed since its 18th century coinage to comprehend the entire political spectrum, though retaining the connotation of ""change at the root"".","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.520","Politics","","Politics is the set of activities that are associated with the governance of a country, state or an area. It involves making decisions that apply to groups of members.It refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance\u2014organized control over a human community, particularly a state. The academic study focusing on just politics, which is therefore more targeted than general political science, is sometimes referred to as politology (not to be confused with politicology, a synonym for political science).In modern nation-states, people often form political parties to represent their ideas. Members of a party often agree to take the same position on many issues and agree to support the same changes to law and the same leaders.An election is usually a competition between different parties. Some examples of political parties worldwide are: the African National Congress (ANC) in South Africa, the Democratic Party (D) in the United States, the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in Germany and the Indian National Congress in India which has the highest number of political parties in the world (2546 political parties) .\nPolitics is a multifaceted word. It has a set of fairly specific meanings that are descriptive and nonjudgmental (such as ""the art or science of government"" and ""political principles""), but does often colloquially carry a negative connotation. The word has been used negatively for many years: the British national anthem as published in 1745 calls on God to ""Confound their politics"", and the phrase ""play politics"", for example, has been in use since at least 1853, when abolitionist Wendell Phillips declared: ""We do not play politics; anti-slavery is no half-jest with us.""A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level. During the past decade two tendencies (1.Concern for theoretical explication and methodological rigor, and 2. The emphasis on field studies of the \u201cemerging,\u201d \u201cnew,\u201d and \u201cnon-Western\u201d nations) made it possible to overlook comparative politics. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a  society. The history of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's Republic, Aristotle's Politics, the works of Confucius and Arthashastra and Chanakya neeti by Chanakya in 3rd Century BCE.","wikipedia","5.1"

"3.522","Politics of North Korea","","The politics of North Korea (officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea or DPRK) takes place within the framework of the official state philosophy, Juche, a concept created by Hwang Jang-yop and later attributed to Kim Il-sung. The Juche theory is the belief that through self-reliance and a strong independent state, true socialism can be achieved.North Korea's political system is built upon the principle of centralization. While the North Korean constitution formally guarantees protection of human rights, in practice there are severe limits on freedom of expression, and the government closely supervises the lives of North Korean citizens. The constitution defines North Korea as ""a dictatorship of people's democracy"" under the leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), which is given legal supremacy over other political parties.\nThe WPK is the ruling party of North Korea. It has been in power since its creation in 1948. Two minor political parties also exist, but are legally bound to accept the ruling role of the WPK. They, with the WPK, comprise the popular front Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland (DFRF). Elections occur only in single-candidate races where the candidate is effectively selected beforehand by the WPK.In addition to the parties, there are over 100 mass organizations controlled by the WPK. Those who are not WPK members are required to join one of these organizations. Of these, the most important ones are the Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist Youth League, Socialist Women's Union of Korea, General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea, and Union of Agricultural Workers of Korea. These four organizations are also DFRF members.Kim Il-sung ruled the country from 1948 until his death in July 1994, holding the offices of General Secretary of the WPK from 1949 to 1994 (titled as Chairman from 1949 to 1972), Premier of North Korea from 1948 to 1972 and President from 1972 to 1994. He was succeeded by his son, Kim Jong-il.  While the younger Kim had been his father's designated successor since the 1980s, it took him three years to consolidate his power. He was named to his father's old post of General Secretary in 1997, and in 1998 became chairman of the National Defence Commission (NDC), which gave him command of the armed forces. The constitution was amended to make the NDC chairmanship ""the highest post in the state."" At the same time, the presidential post was written out of the constitution, and Kim Il-sung was designated ""Eternal President of the Republic"" in order to honor his memory forever. Most analysts believe the title to be a product of the cult of personality he cultivated during his life.\nOutside observers generally view North Korea as a Stalinist dictatorship particularly noting the elaborate cult of personality around Kim Il-sung and his family. The Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), led by a member of the ruling family, holds power in the state and leads the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland of which all political officers are required to be members. The government has formally replaced all references to Marxism\u2013Leninism in its constitution with the locally developed concept of Juche, or self-reliance. In recent years, there has been great emphasis on the Songun or ""military-first"" philosophy. All references to communism were removed from the North Korean constitution in 2009.The status of the military has been enhanced, and it appears to occupy the center of the North Korean political system; all the social sectors are forced to follow the military spirit and adopt military methods. Kim Jong-il's public activity focused heavily on ""on-the-spot guidance"" of places and events related to the military. The enhanced status of the military and military-centered political system was confirmed at the first session of the 10th Supreme People's Assembly (SPA) by the promotion of NDC members into the official power hierarchy. All ten NDC members were ranked within the top twenty on 5 September, and all but one occupied the top twenty at the fiftieth anniversary of the Day of the Foundation of the Republic on 9 September.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.523","Pollution","","Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change. Pollution can take the form of chemical substances or energy, such as noise, heat or light. Pollutants, the components of pollution, can be either foreign substances/energies or naturally occurring contaminants. Pollution is often classed as point source or nonpoint source pollution.\nIn 2015, pollution killed 9 million people in the world.Major forms of pollution include: Air pollution, light pollution, littering, noise pollution, plastic pollution, soil contamination, radioactive contamination, thermal pollution, visual pollution, water pollution.","wikipedia","5.9"
"3.524","Polyamory","","Polyamory (from Greek \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd poly, ""many, several"", and Latin amor, ""love"") is the practice of, or desire for, intimate relationships with more than one partner, with the informed consent of all partners involved. It has been described as ""consensual, ethical, and responsible non-monogamy"". People who identify as polyamorous believe in an open relationship with a conscious management of jealousy; they reject the view that sexual and relational exclusivity are necessary for deep, committed, long-term loving relationships.Polyamory has come to be an umbrella term for various forms of non-monogamous, multi-partner relationships, or non-exclusive sexual or romantic relationships. Its usage reflects the choices and philosophies of the individuals involved, but with recurring themes or values, such as love, intimacy, honesty, integrity, equality, communication, and commitment.","wikipedia","5.7"
"3.525","Polygamy","","Polygamy (from Late Greek \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03c5\u03b3\u03b1\u03bc\u03af\u03b1, polygam\u00eda, ""state of marriage to many spouses"") is the practice of marrying multiple spouses. When a man is married to more than one wife at a time, sociologists call this polygyny. When a woman is married to more than one husband at a time, it is called polyandry. If a marriage includes multiple husbands and wives, it can be called a group marriage.\nIn contrast, monogamy is marriage consisting of only two parties. Like ""monogamy"", the term ""polygamy"" is often used in a de facto sense, applied regardless of whether the state recognizes the relationship. In sociobiology and zoology, researchers use polygamy in a broad sense to mean any form of multiple mating.\nWorldwide, different societies variously encourage, accept or outlaw polygamy. Of societies which allow or tolerate polygamy, in the vast majority of cases the form accepted is polygyny. According to the Ethnographic Atlas (1998), of 1,231 societies noted, 588 had frequent polygyny, 453 had occasional polygyny, 186 were monogamous and 4 had polyandry; although more recent research suggests polyandry may be more common than previously thought. In cultures which practice polygamy, its prevalence among that population is often connected to class and socioeconomic status.From a legal point of view, in many countries, although marriage is legally monogamous (a person can only have one spouse, and bigamy is illegal), adultery is not illegal, leading to a situation of  de facto polygamy being allowed, although without legal recognition for non-official ""spouses"".\nAccording to scientific studies, the human mating system is considered to be primarily monogamous, with cultural practice of polygamy to be in the minority, based on both surveys of world populations, and on characteristics of human reproductive physiology.","wikipedia","5.7"
"3.527","Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust","","The start of the pontificate of Pius XII occurred at the time of the Second World War and the Nazi Holocaust, which over the course of the war would see the murder of millions of Jews and others by Adolf Hitler's Germany. Pius employed diplomacy to aid the victims of the Nazis during the war and, through directing his Church to provide discreet aid to Jews and others, saved hundreds of thousands of lives. Pius maintained links to the German Resistance, and shared intelligence with the Allies. His strongest public condemnation of genocide was, however, considered inadequate by the Allied Powers, while the Nazis viewed him as an Allied sympathizer who had dishonoured his policy of Vatican neutrality.Some post-war critics have accused Pius of either being overly cautious, or of ""not doing enough"", or even of ""silence"" in the face of the Holocaust. Yet, supporters have held that he saved thousands, if not tens or hundreds of thousands of Jews by ordering his Church to provide them with sanctuary and aid, and that he provided moral and intellectual leadership in opposition to the violent racism of Nazi ideology.Pius XII had served as a Vatican diplomat in Germany prior to the war and as Vatican Secretary of State under Pius XI. In this capacity he had been a critic of Nazism and helped draft the 1937 Mit brennender Sorge anti-Nazi encyclical. In his 1939 Summi Pontificatus first papal encyclical, Pius XII expressed dismay at the 1939 Invasion of Poland; reiterated Catholic teaching against racism and antisemitism; and endorsed resistance against those opposed to the ethical principles of the ""Revelation on Sinai"" and the Sermon on the Mount. At Christmas 1942, once evidence of the industrial slaughter of the Jews had emerged, he voiced concern at the murder of ""hundreds of thousands"" of ""faultless"" people because of their ""nationality or race"". Pius intervened to attempt to block Nazi deportations of Jews in various countries from 1942\u20131944. Upon his death in 1958, Pius was praised emphatically by the Israeli Foreign Minister, and other world leaders. But his insistence on Vatican neutrality and avoidance of naming the Nazis as the evildoers of the conflict became the foundation for contemporary and later criticisms from some quarters. Studies of the Vatican archives and international diplomatic correspondence continue.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.528","Poppers","","Popper is a slang term given broadly to drugs of the chemical class called alkyl nitrites that are inhaled. Most widely sold products include the original isoamyl nitrite or isopentyl nitrite, and  isopropyl nitrite. Isobutyl nitrite was also used until it was banned by the European Union. In some countries, to evade anti-drug laws, poppers are labelled or packaged as room deodorizers, leather polish, or tape head cleaner.\n\nPopper use has a relaxation effect on involuntary smooth muscles, such as those in the throat and anus. It is used for practical purposes to facilitate anal sex by increasing blood flow and relaxing sphincter muscles, initially within the gay community.""If you trace the bottle of amyl (a type of alkyl nitrite) through late 20th century history, you trace the legacies of gay culture on popular culture in the 20th century\u201d\nThe drug is also used or for recreational drug purposes, typically for the ""high"" or ""rush"" that the drug can create.\nPoppers were part of club culture from the mid-1970s disco scene and returned to popularity in the 1980s and 1990s rave scene.\n\n","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.526","Pop punk","","Pop punk (also known as punk-pop, pop punk rock or pop-punk) is a genre of rock music that combines influences of pop music with punk rock. Fast tempos, prominent electric guitars with distortion, and power chord changes are typically played under pop-influenced melodies and vocal styles with lighthearted lyrical themes including boredom, rebellion and teenage romance.\nEarly punk rock bands such as Ramones, Buzzcocks, the Dickies, Stiff Little Fingers, Generation X, the Adicts, and the Undertones all had strong sense of melody, taking some cues from pop rock and power pop. In the early\u2013mid 1980s, punk rock bands such as the Descendents combined punk rock and hardcore punk with pop-influenced melodies and lyrical themes involving humor, girls, and teenage confusion. 1980s punk bands like Husker Du and Bad Religion influenced later pop punk music. Pop punk in the United States began to grow in popularity in the mid-to-late 1980s and early 1990s, especially in California where independent record labels (most notably Lookout! Records) adopted a do it yourself (DIY) approach to releasing music. Lookout! Records signed punk rock and pop punk bands like Green Day, Screeching Weasel, The Queers, Rancid, and The Mr. T Experience.\nIn the mid-1990s, punk rock broke into the mainstream with the success of Green Day, Rancid, and the Offspring. During this time, these bands sold millions of records and received extensive radio and television airplay. In the late 1990s, bands such as Lit, Eve 6, and Blink-182 became mainstream, with the latter considered a key group in its development, providing a massive influential appeal to countless bands for years to come. In 2011, The New York Times asserted, ""no punk band of the 1990s has been more influential than Blink-182"". In the early\u2013mid 2000s, pop punk bands like Sum 41, Good Charlotte, New Found Glory, Bowling for Soup, Simple Plan and Yellowcard also achieved mainstream success. In the 2000s, emo pop, a genre that combines emo with pop punk, became one of the most mainstream genres of rock with the mainstream success of emo pop bands like Fall Out Boy, Panic! at the Disco, My Chemical Romance, The All-American Rejects, and Paramore. Although pop punk's mainstream popularity declined in the 2010s, the genre still has had some success with bands like The Story So Far, Real Friends, The Wonder Years, Waterparks, and Neck Deep.","wikipedia","5.12"
"3.529","Pornographic magazine","","Pornographic magazines, or erotic magazines, sometimes known as adult, sex or top-shelf magazines, are magazines that contain content of an explicitly sexual nature. Publications of this kind may contain images of attractive naked subjects, as is the case in softcore pornography,  and, in the usual case of hardcore pornography, depictions of masturbation, oral, vaginal or anal sex.They primarily serve to stimulate sexual arousal, and are often used as an aid to masturbation. Some magazines are general in their content, while others may be more specific and focus on a particular pornographic niche, part of the anatomy, or model characteristics. Examples include Asian Babes which focuses on Asian women, or Leg Show which concentrates on women's legs. Well-known adult magazines include Playboy, Penthouse and Hustler. Magazines may also carry articles on topics including cars, humor, science, computers, culture and politics.  With the continued progression of print media to digital, retailers have also had to adapt. Software such as Apple's discontinued  Newsstand enabled the downloading and displaying of digital versions of magazines, but it do not allow pornographic material. However, there are specific digital newsstands for pornographic magazines.","wikipedia","5.12"
"3.530","Pornography","","Pornography (often shortened to porn) is the portrayal of sexual subject matter for the exclusive purpose of sexual arousal. Pornography may be presented in a variety of media, including books, magazines, postcards, photographs, sculpture, drawing, painting, animation, sound recording, phone calls, writing, film, video, and video games. The term applies to the depiction of the act rather than the act itself, and so does not include live exhibitions like sex shows and striptease. The primary subjects of present-day pornographic depictions are pornographic models, who pose for still photographs, and pornographic actors or ""porn stars"", who perform in pornographic films. If dramatic skills are not involved, a performer in pornographic media may also be called a model.\nVarious groups within society have considered depictions of a sexual nature immoral, addictive, and noxious, labeling them pornographic, and attempting to have them suppressed under obscenity and other laws, with varying degrees of success. Such works have also often been subject to censorship and other legal restraints to publication, display, or possession, leading in many cases to their loss. Such grounds, and even the definition of pornography, have differed in various historical, cultural, and national contexts.Social attitudes towards the discussion and presentation of sexuality have become more tolerant in Western countries, and legal definitions of obscenity have become more limited, notably beginning in 1969 with Blue Movie by Andy Warhol, the first adult erotic film depicting explicit sex to receive wide theatrical release in the United States, and the subsequent Golden Age of Porn (1969\u20131984), leading to an industry for the production and consumption of pornography in the latter half of the 20th century. The introduction of home video and the Internet saw a boom in the worldwide porn industry that generates billions of dollars annually. Commercialized pornography accounts for over US$2.5 billion in the United States alone, including the production of various media and associated products and services. The general porn industry is between $10\u2013$12 billion in the U.S. In 2006, the world pornography revenue was 97 billion dollars. This industry employs thousands of performers along with support and production staff. It is also followed by dedicated industry publications and trade groups as well as the mainstream press, private organizations (watchdog groups), government agencies, and political organizations. More recently, sites such as Pornhub, RedTube, and YouPorn, in addition to much pirated porn posted by individuals, have served as repositories for home-made or semi-professional pornography, made available free by its creators (who could be called exhibitionists). They present a significant challenge to the commercial pornographic film industry.\nIrrespective of the legal or social view of pornography, it has been used in a number of contexts. It is used, for example, at fertility clinics to stimulate sperm donors. Some couples use pornography at times for variety and to create a sexual interest or as part of foreplay. There is also some evidence that pornography can be used to treat voyeurism.","wikipedia","5.7"

"3.532","Poverty","","Poverty is not having enough material possessions or income for a person's needs. Poverty may include social, economic, and political elements.\nAbsolute poverty is the complete lack of the means necessary to meet basic personal needs, such as food, clothing and shelter.  The threshold at which absolute poverty is defined is always about the same, independent of the person's permanent location or era.\nOn the other hand, relative poverty occurs when a person cannot meet a minimum level of living standards, compared to others in the same time and place. Therefore, the threshold at which relative poverty is defined varies from one country to another, or from one society to another.  For example, a person who cannot afford housing better than a small tent in an open field would be said to live in relative poverty if almost everyone else in that area lives in modern brick homes, but not if everyone else also lives in small tents in open fields (for example, in a nomadic tribe).\nGovernments and non-governmental organizations try to reduce poverty.  Providing basic needs to people who are unable to earn a sufficient income can be hampered by constraints on government's ability to deliver services, such as corruption, tax avoidance, debt and loan conditionalities and by the brain drain of health care and educational professionals. Strategies of increasing income to make basic needs more affordable typically include welfare, economic freedoms and providing financial services.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.533","Pregnancy","","Pregnancy, also known as gestation, is the time during which one or more offspring develops inside a woman. A multiple pregnancy involves more than one offspring, such as with twins. Pregnancy can occur by sexual intercourse or assisted reproductive technology. A pregnancy may end in a live birth, abortion, or miscarriage, though access to safe abortion care varies globally. Childbirth typically occurs around 40 weeks from the start of the last menstrual period (LMP). This is just over nine months, where each month averages 31 days. When measured from fertilization it is about 38 weeks. An embryo is the developing offspring during the first eight weeks following fertilization, after which, the term fetus is used until birth. Symptoms of early pregnancy may include  missed periods, tender breasts, nausea and vomiting, hunger, and frequent urination. Pregnancy may be confirmed with a pregnancy test.Pregnancy is divided into three trimesters, each lasting for approximately 3 months. The first trimester includes conception, which is when the sperm fertilizes the egg. The fertilized egg then travels down the fallopian tube and attaches to the inside of the uterus, where it begins to form the embryo and placenta. During the first trimester, the possibility of miscarriage (natural death of embryo or fetus) is at its highest. Around the middle of the second trimester, movement of the fetus may be felt. At 28 weeks, more than 90% of babies can survive outside of the uterus if provided with high-quality medical care.Prenatal care improves pregnancy outcomes. Prenatal care may include taking extra folic acid, avoiding drugs and alcohol, regular exercise, blood tests, and regular physical examinations. Complications of pregnancy may include disorders of high blood pressure, gestational diabetes, iron-deficiency anemia, and severe nausea and vomiting among others. In the ideal childbirth labor begins on its own when a woman is ""at term"". Babies born before 37 weeks are ""preterm"" and at higher risk of health problems such as cerebral palsy. Babies born between weeks 37 and 39 are considered ""early term"" while those born between weeks 39 and 41 are considered ""full term"". Babies born between weeks 41 and 42 weeks are considered ""late term"" while after 42 week they are considered ""post term"". Delivery before 39 weeks by labor induction or caesarean section is not recommended unless required for other medical reasons.About 213 million pregnancies occurred in 2012, of which, 190 million (89%) were in the developing world and 23 million (11%) were in the developed world. The number of pregnancies in women ages 15 to 44 is 133 per 1,000 women. About 10% to 15% of recognized pregnancies end in miscarriage. In 2016, complications of pregnancy resulted in 230,600 maternal deaths, down from 377,000 deaths in 1990. Common causes include bleeding, infections, hypertensive diseases of pregnancy, obstructed labor, and complications associated with miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, or elective abortion. Globally, 44% of pregnancies are unplanned. Over half (56%) of unplanned pregnancies are aborted. Among unintended pregnancies in the United States, 60% of the women used birth control to some extent during the month pregnancy occurred.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.534","Pregnancy fetishism","","Pregnancy fetishism (also known as maiesiophilia or maieusophoria) is a context where pregnancy is seen by individuals or cultures as an erotic phenomenon. It may involve sexual attraction to women who are pregnant or appear pregnant, attraction to lactation, or attraction to particular stages of pregnancy such as impregnation or childbirth.","wikipedia","5.7"
"3.536","Premature birth","","Preterm birth, also known as premature birth, is the birth of a baby at fewer than 37 weeks' gestational age, as opposed to the usual about 40 weeks. These babies are known as preemies or premmies. Symptoms of preterm labor include uterine contractions which occur more often than every ten minutes or the leaking of fluid from the vagina. Premature infants are at greater risk for cerebral palsy, delays in development, hearing problems and sight problems. The earlier a baby is born, the greater these risks will be.The cause of preterm birth is often not known. Risk factors include diabetes, high blood pressure, being pregnant with more than one baby, being either obese or underweight, a number of vaginal infections, air pollution including tobacco smoking, and psychological stress. It is recommended that labor not be medically induced before 39 weeks unless required for other medical reasons. The same recommendation applies to cesarean section. Medical reasons for early delivery include preeclampsia.In those at risk, the hormone progesterone, if taken during pregnancy, may prevent preterm birth. Evidence does not support the usefulness of bed rest. It is estimated that at least 75% of preterm infants would survive with appropriate treatment, and the survival rate is highest among the infants born the latest. In women who might deliver between 24 and 37 weeks, corticosteroids improve outcomes. A number of medications, including nifedipine, may delay delivery so that a mother can be moved to where more medical care is available and the corticosteroids have a greater chance to work. Once the baby is born, care includes keeping the baby warm through skin to skin contact, supporting breastfeeding, treating infections and supporting breathing.Preterm birth is the most common cause of death among infants worldwide. About 15 million babies are preterm each year (5% to 18% of all deliveries). Approximately 0.5% of births are extremely early periviable births, and these account for most of the deaths. In many countries, rates of premature births have increased between the 1990s and 2010s. Complications from preterm births resulted in 0.81 million deaths in 2015 down from 1.57 million in 1990. The chance of survival at 22 weeks is about 6%, while at 23 weeks it is 26%, 24 weeks 55% and 25 weeks about 72%. The chances of survival without any long-term difficulties are lower.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.535","Prem Rawat","","Prem Pal Singh Rawat (Hindi: \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0947\u092e \u092a\u093e\u0932 \u0938\u093f\u0902\u0939 \u0930\u093e\u0935\u0924), born 10 December 1957, is an Indian American also known as Maharajji, and formerly as Guru Maharaj Ji and Balyogeshwar. Rawat's teachings include a meditation practice he calls ""Knowledge"", and peace education based on the discovery of personal resources such as inner strength, choice, appreciation and hope.Prem Pal Singh Rawat is the youngest son of Hans Ram Singh Rawat, an Indian guru and the founder of the Divya Sandesh Parishad (later known as Divine Light Mission, or DLM). After his father's death, eight-year-old Prem Rawat became the new ""Satguru"" (True Master). At age 13 Prem Rawat traveled to the West, soon taking up residence in the United States. Many young adults took interest in the claim that Prem Rawat could impart direct knowledge of God to his followers, and some have said to have experienced it. Many news media were perplexed by his youth and claims of divine status, and he was criticized for a lack of intellectual content in his public discourses, and for leading an opulent lifestyle. At the same time, internally the movement made a point of focusing on non-intellectual domains of spiritual practice.  Time magazine reported that many Indian spiritual teachers were critical of him for starting followers with methods that were too advanced.  Tens of thousands were initiated in Knowledge techniques, and hundreds of DLM centers opened worldwide. Some Western followers took up communal life in dozens of ashrams, guided by DLM Mahatmas.\nIn November 1973, the Millennium '73 festival was held in the Houston Astrodome, and although this was near the height of Prem Rawat's media fame, attendance was far lower than expected. When he turned 16, Prem Rawat became emancipated and got married. He cut ties to his mother and eldest brother, and with the original Indian DLM organization. He retained control of the DLM everywhere else (at this point it was established in 55 countries).\nIn the early 1980s, he began to discard direct references to religion in his speeches and closed the ashrams. The name of the DLM was changed to Elan Vital. From 1980 to the present, Prem Rawat has continued to travel extensively.\nIn 2001 he established ""The Prem Rawat Foundation"" to fund his work and humanitarian efforts. Prem Rawat continues to speak for large and/or select audiences worldwide, and on several occasions has received significant recognition for his work and message of peace.","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.537","Prenatal care","","Prenatal care, also known as antenatal care, is a type of preventive healthcare. Its goal is to provide regular check-ups that allow doctors or midwives to treat and prevent potential health problems throughout the course of the pregnancy and to promote healthy lifestyles that benefit both mother and child. During check-ups, pregnant women receive medical information over maternal physiological changes in pregnancy, biological changes, and prenatal nutrition including prenatal vitamins. Recommendations on management and healthy lifestyle changes are also made during regular check-ups. The availability of routine prenatal care, including prenatal screening and diagnosis, has played a part in reducing the frequency of maternal death, miscarriages, birth defects, low birth weight, neonatal infections and other preventable health problems.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) reported that in 2015 around 830 women died every day from problems in pregnancy and childbirth. Only 5 lived in high-income countries. The rest lived in low-income countries.A study examined the differences in early and low-weight birth deliveries between local and immigrant women and saw the difference caused by prenatal care received. The study, between 1997 and 2008, looked at 21,708 women giving birth in a region of Spain. The results indicated that very preterm birth (VPTB) and very low birth weight (VLBW) were much more common for immigrants than locals (Castell\u00f3 et al., 2012). The study showed the importance of prenatal care and how universal prenatal care would help people of all origins get proper care before pregnancy/birth (Castell\u00f3 et al., 2012).\nThe WHO recommends that pregnant women should all receive four antenatal visits to spot and treat problems and give immunizations. Although antenatal care is important to improve the health of both mother and baby, many women do not receive four visits.There are many ways of changing health systems to help women access antenatal care, such as new health policies, educating health workers and health service reorganisation. Community interventions to help people change their behavior can also play a part. Examples of interventions are media campaigns reaching many people, enabling communities to take control of their own health, informative-education-communication interventions and financial incentives. A review looking at these interventions found that one intervention helps improve the number of women receiving antenatal care. However interventions used together may reduce baby deaths in pregnancy and early life, lower numbers of low birth weight babies born and improve numbers of women receiving antenatal care.Traditional prenatal care in high-income countries generally consists of:\n\nmonthly visits during the first two trimesters (from the 1st week to the 28th week)\nfortnightly visits from the 28th week to the 36th week of pregnancy\nweekly visits after 36th week to the delivery, from the 38th week to the 42nd week\nAssessment of parental needs and family dynamicsThe traditional form of antenatal care has developed from the early 1900s and there is very little research to suggest that it is the best way of giving antenatal care. Antenatal care can be costly and uses a lot of staff. The following paragraphs describe research on other forms of antenatal care, which may reduce the burden on maternity services in all countries.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.538","Price–Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act","","The Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act (commonly called the Price-Anderson Act) is a United States federal law, first passed in 1957 and since renewed several times, which governs liability-related issues for all non-military nuclear facilities constructed in the United States before 2026. The main purpose of the Act is to partially compensate the nuclear industry against liability claims arising from nuclear incidents while still ensuring compensation coverage for the general public.  The Act establishes a no fault insurance-type system in which the first approximately $12.6 billion (as of 2011) is industry-funded as described in the Act. Any claims above the $12.6 billion would be covered by a Congressional mandate to retroactively increase nuclear utility liability or would be covered by the federal government. At the time of the Act's passing, it was considered necessary as an incentive for the private production of nuclear power \u2014 this was because electric utilities viewed the available liability coverage (only $60 million) as inadequate.In 1978, the Act survived a constitutional challenge in the Supreme Court case Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group (see below).  The Act was last renewed in 2005 for a 20-year period.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.539","Prison","","A prison, also known as a correctional facility, jail, gaol (dated, British and Australian English), penitentiary (American English), detention center (or centre if outside the US), correctional center, (American English) or remand center, is a facility in which inmates (or prisoners) are forcibly confined and denied a variety of freedoms under the authority of the state. Prisons are most commonly used within a criminal justice system: people charged with crimes may be imprisoned until their trial; those pleading or being found guilty of crimes at trial may be sentenced to a specified period of imprisonment. In simplest terms, a prison can also be described as a building in which people are legally held as a punishment for a crime they have committed.\nPrisons can also be used as a tool of political repression by authoritarian regimes. Their perceived opponents may be imprisoned for political crimes, often without trial or other legal due process; this use is illegal under most forms of international law governing fair administration of justice. In times of war, prisoners of war or detainees may be detained in military prisons or prisoner of war camps, and large groups of civilians might be imprisoned in internment camps.\nIn American English, the terms prison and jail have separate definitions, though this is not always followed in casual speech. A prison or penitentiary holds people for longer periods of time, such as many years, and is operated by a state or federal government. A jail holds people for shorter periods of time (e.g. for shorter sentences or pre-trial detention) and is usually operated by a local government. Outside of North America, prison and jail have the same meaning.\nSlang terms for a prison include: ""the pokey"", ""the slammer"", ""the cage"", ""the can"", ""the clink"", ""the joint"", ""the calaboose"", ""the hoosegow"", ""crowbar hotel"" and ""the big house"".

"3.540","Prohibition","","Prohibition is the act or practice of forbidding something by law; more particularly the term refers to the banning of the manufacture, storage (whether in barrels or in bottles), transportation, sale, possession, and consumption of alcoholic beverages. The word is also used to refer to a period of time during which such bans are enforced.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.541","Project Chanology","","Project Chanology (also called Operation Chanology) was a protest movement against the practices of the Church of Scientology by members of Anonymous, a leaderless Internet-based group. The project was started in response to the Church of Scientology's attempts to remove material from a highly publicized interview with Scientologist Tom Cruise from the Internet in January 2008.\nThe project was publicly launched in the form of a video posted to YouTube, ""Message to Scientology"", on January 21, 2008. The video states that Anonymous views Scientology's actions as Internet censorship, and asserts the group's intent to ""expel the church from the Internet"". This was followed by distributed denial-of-service attacks (DDoS), and soon after, black faxes, prank calls, and other measures intended to disrupt the Church of Scientology's operations. In February 2008, the focus of the protest shifted to legal methods, including nonviolent protests and an attempt to get the Internal Revenue Service to investigate the Church of Scientology's tax exempt status in the United States.\nReactions from the Church of Scientology regarding the protesters' actions have varied. Initially, one spokesperson stated that members of the group ""have got some wrong information"" about Scientology. Another referred to the group as a group of ""computer geeks"". Later, the Church of Scientology started referring to Anonymous as ""cyberterrorists"" perpetrating ""religious hate crimes"" against the church.\nDetractors of Scientology have also criticized the actions of Project Chanology, asserting that they merely provide the Church of Scientology with the opportunity to ""play the religious persecution card"". Other critics such as Mark Bunker and Tory Christman initially questioned the legality of Project Chanology's methods, but have since spoken out in support of the project as it shifted towards nonviolent protests and other legal methods.\n\n","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.542","Prostitution","","Prostitution is the business or practice of engaging in sexual activity in exchange for payment. Prostitution is sometimes described as sexual services, commercial sex or, colloquially, hooking. It is sometimes referred to euphemistically as ""the world's oldest profession"" in the English-speaking world. A person who works in this field is called a prostitute and is a type of sex worker.\nProstitution occurs in a variety of forms, and its legal status varies from country to country (sometimes from region to region within a given country), ranging from being an enforced or unenforced crime, to unregulated, to a regulated profession. It is one branch of the sex industry, along with pornography, stripping, and erotic dancing. Brothels are establishments specifically dedicated to prostitution. In escort prostitution, the act may take place at the client's residence or hotel room (referred to as out-call), or at the escort's residence or a hotel room rented for the occasion by the escort (in-call). Another form is street prostitution.\nThere are about 42 million prostitutes in the world, living all over the world (though most of Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa lacks data, studied countries in that large region rank as top sex tourism destinations). Estimates place the annual revenue generated by prostitution worldwide to be over $100 billion.\nThe majority of prostitutes are female and have male clients.\nThe position of prostitution and the law varies widely worldwide, reflecting differing opinions. Some view prostitution as a form of exploitation of or violence against women, and children, that helps to create a supply of victims for human trafficking. Some critics of prostitution as an institution are supporters of the ""Nordic model"", which decriminalizes the act of selling sex, but makes the purchase of sex illegal. This approach has also been adopted by Canada, Iceland, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Norway, and France. Others view sex work as a legitimate occupation, whereby a person trades or exchanges sexual acts for money. Amnesty International is one of the notable groups calling for the decriminalization of prostitution.","wikipedia","5.7"
"3.543","Protestant Reformation","","The Reformation (alternatively named the Protestant Reformation or the European Reformation) was a movement within Western Christianity in the 16th-century Europe that posed a religious and political challenge to the Roman Catholic Church and papal authority in particular. Although the Reformation is usually considered to have started with the publication of the Ninety-five Theses by Martin Luther in 1517, there was no schism between the Catholic Church and the nascent Luther until the 1521 Edict of Worms. The edict condemned Luther and officially banned citizens of the Holy Roman Empire from defending or propagating his ideas. The end of the Reformation era is disputed: it could be considered to end with the enactment of the confessions of faith which began the Age of Orthodoxy. Other suggested ending years relate to the Counter-Reformation, the Peace of Westphalia, or that it never ended since there are still Protestants today.Movements had been made towards a Reformation prior to Luther, so some Protestants in the tradition of the Radical Reformation prefer to credit the start of the Reformation to reformers such as Arnold of Brescia, Peter Waldo, John Wycliffe, Jan Hus, Petr Chel\u010dick\u00fd, and Girolamo Savonarola. Due to the reform efforts of Hus and other Bohemian reformers, Utraquist Hussitism was acknowledged by the Council of Basel and was officially tolerated in the Crown of Bohemia, although other movements were still subject to persecution, including the Lollards in England and the Waldensians in France and Italian regions.Luther began by criticising the sale of indulgences, insisting that the Pope had no authority over purgatory and that the Treasury of Merit had no foundation in the Bible. The Reformation developed further to include a distinction between Law and Gospel, a complete reliance on Scripture as the only source of proper doctrine (sola scriptura) and the belief that faith in Jesus is the only way to receive God's pardon for sin (sola fide) rather than good works. Although this is generally considered a Protestant belief, a similar formulation was taught by Molinist and Jansenist Catholics. The priesthood of all believers downplayed the need for saints or priests to serve as mediators, and mandatory clerical celibacy was ended. Simul justus et peccator implied that although people could improve, no one could become good enough to earn forgiveness from God. Sacramental theology was simplified and attempts at imposing Aristotelian epistemology were resisted.\nLuther and his followers did not see these theological developments as changes. The 1530 Augsburg Confession concluded that ""in doctrine and ceremonies nothing has been received on our part against Scripture or the Church Catholic"", and even after the Council of Trent, Martin Chemnitz published the 1565\u201373 Examination of the Council of Trent as an attempt to prove that Trent innovated on doctrine while the Lutherans were following in the footsteps of the Church Fathers and Apostles.The initial movement in Germany diversified, and other reformers arose independently of Luther such as Zwingli in Z\u00fcrich and John Calvin in Geneva. Depending on the country, the Reformation had varying causes and different backgrounds, and also unfolded differently than in Germany. The spread of Gutenberg's printing press provided the means for the rapid dissemination of religious materials in the vernacular.\nDuring Reformation-era confessionalization, Western Christianity adopted different confessions (Catholic, Lutheran, Reformed, Anglican, Anabaptist, Unitarian, etc.). Radical Reformers, besides forming communities outside state sanction, sometimes employed more extreme doctrinal change, such as the rejection of the tenets of the councils of Nicaea and Chalcedon with the Unitarians of Transylvania. Anabaptist movements were especially persecuted following the German Peasants' War.\nLeaders within the Roman Catholic Church responded with the Counter-Reformation, initiated by the Confutatio Augustana in 1530, the Council of Trent in 1545, the Jesuits in 1540, the Defensio Tridentin\u00e6 fidei in 1578, and also a series of wars and expulsions of Protestants that continued until the 19th century. Northern Europe, with the exception of most of Ireland, came under the influence of Protestantism. Southern Europe remained predominantly Catholic apart from the much-persecuted Waldensians. Central Europe was the site of much of the Thirty Years' War and there were continued expulsions of Protestants in Central Europe up to the 19th century. Following World War II, the removal of ethnic Germans to either East Germany or Siberia reduced Protestantism in the Warsaw Pact countries, although some remain today.\nAbsence of Protestants however, does not necessarily imply a failure of the Reformation. Although Protestants were excommunicated and ended up worshiping in communions separate from Catholics, contrary to the original intention of the Reformers, they were also suppressed and persecuted in most of Europe at one point. As a result, some of them lived as crypto-Protestants, also called Nicodemites, contrary to the urging of John Calvin, who wanted them to live their faith openly. Some crypto-Protestants have been identified as late as the 19th century after immigrating to Latin America.","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.544","Prussia","","Prussia (; German: Preu\u00dfen, pronounced [\u02c8p\u0281\u0254\u028fsn\u0329] (listen), Old Prussian: Pr\u016bsa or Pr\u016bsija) was a historically prominent German state that originated in 1525 with a duchy centered on the region of Prussia on the southeast coast of the Baltic Sea. It was de facto dissolved by an emergency decree transferring powers of the Prussian government to German Chancellor Franz von Papen in 1932 and de jure by an Allied decree in 1947. For centuries, the House of Hohenzollern ruled Prussia, successfully expanding its size by way of an unusually well-organised and effective army. Prussia, with its capital first in K\u00f6nigsberg and then, in 1701, in Berlin, decisively shaped the history of Germany.\nIn 1871, most German states (notably excluding Austria and Switzerland) united to create the German Empire under Prussian leadership. In November 1918, the monarchies were abolished and the nobility lost its political power during the German Revolution of 1918\u201319. The Kingdom of Prussia was thus abolished in favour of a republic\u2014the Free State of Prussia, a state of Germany from 1918 until 1933. From 1933, Prussia lost its independence as a result of the Prussian coup, when the Nazi regime was successfully establishing its Gleichschaltung laws in pursuit of a unitary state. With the end of the Nazi regime, in 1945, the division of Germany into Allied occupation zones and the separation of its territories east of the Oder\u2013Neisse line, which were incorporated into Poland and the Soviet Union, the State of Prussia ceased to exist de facto. Prussia existed de jure until its formal abolition by the Allied Control Council Enactment No. 46 of 25 February 1947.The name Prussia derives from the Old Prussians; in the 13th century, the Teutonic Knights\u2014an organized Catholic medieval military order of German crusaders\u2014conquered the lands inhabited by them. In 1308, the Teutonic Knights conquered the region of Pomerelia with Gda\u0144sk (Danzig). Their monastic state was mostly Germanised through immigration from central and western Germany, and, in the south, it was Polonised by settlers from Masovia. The Second Peace of Thorn (1466) split Prussia into the western Royal Prussia, a province of Poland, and the eastern part, from 1525 called the Duchy of Prussia, a fief of the Crown of Poland up to 1657. The union of Brandenburg and the Duchy of Prussia in 1618 led to the proclamation of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701.\nPrussia entered the ranks of the great powers shortly after becoming a kingdom, and exercised most influence in the 18th and 19th centuries. During the 18th century it had a major say in many international affairs under the reign of Frederick the Great. During the 19th century Prussian Chancellor Otto von Bismarck united the German principalities into a ""Lesser Germany"", which excluded the Austrian Empire.\nAt the Congress of Vienna (1814\u201315), which redrew the map of Europe following Napoleon's defeat, Prussia acquired rich new territories, including the coal-rich Ruhr. The country then grew rapidly in influence economically and politically, and became the core of the North German Confederation in 1867, and then of the German Empire in 1871. The Kingdom of Prussia was now so large and so dominant in the new Germany that Junkers and other Prussian \u00e9lites identified more and more as Germans and less as Prussians.\nThe Kingdom ended in 1918 along with other German monarchies that collapsed as a result of the German Revolution. In the Weimar Republic, the Free State of Prussia lost nearly all of its legal and political importance following the 1932 coup led by Franz von Papen. Subsequently, it was effectively dismantled into Nazi German Gaue in 1935. Nevertheless, some Prussian ministries were kept and Hermann G\u00f6ring remained in his role as Minister President of Prussia until the end of World War II. Former eastern territories of Germany that made up a significant part of Prussia lost the majority of their German population after 1945 as the People's Republic of Poland and the Soviet Union both absorbed these territories and had most of its German inhabitants expelled by 1950. Prussia, deemed a bearer of militarism and reaction by the Allies, was officially abolished by an Allied declaration in 1947. The international status of the former eastern territories of Germany was disputed until the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany in 1990, while its return to Germany remains a topic among far right politicians, the Federation of Expellees and various political revisionists.\nThe term Prussian has often been used, especially outside Germany, to emphasise professionalism, aggressiveness, militarism and conservatism of the Junker class of landed aristocrats in the East who dominated first Prussia and then the German Empire.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.545","Psychiatry","","Psychiatry is the medical specialty devoted to the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of mental disorders. These include various maladaptations related to mood, behaviour, cognition, and perceptions. See glossary of psychiatry.\nInitial psychiatric assessment of a person typically begins with a case history and mental status examination. Physical examinations and psychological tests may be conducted. On occasion, neuroimaging or other neurophysiological techniques are used. Mental disorders are often diagnosed in accordance with clinical concepts listed in diagnostic manuals such as the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), edited and used by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the widely used Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). The fifth edition of the DSM (DSM-5) was published in 2013 which re-organized the larger categories of various diseases and expanded upon the previous edition to include information/insights that are consistent with current research.The combined treatment of psychiatric medication and psychotherapy has become the most common mode of psychiatric treatment in current practice, but contemporary practice also includes a wide variety of other modalities, e.g., assertive community treatment, community reinforcement, and supported employment. Treatment may be delivered on an inpatient or outpatient basis, depending on the severity of functional impairment or on other aspects of the disorder in question. An inpatient may be treated in a psychiatric hospital. Research and treatment within psychiatry as a whole are conducted on an interdisciplinary basis with other professionals, such as epidemiologists, nurses, or psychologists.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.546","Psytrance","","Psychedelic trance, psytrance or psy is a subgenre of trance music characterized by arrangements of rhythms and layered melodies created by high tempo riffs.Psytrance lies at the hardcore, underground end of the diverse trance spectrum. The genre offers variety in terms of mood, tempo, and style. Some examples include full on, darkpsy, forest, minimal (Zenonesque), hitech psy, progressive, suomi, psy-chill, psycore, psybient (fusion of psychedelic trance and ambient), psybreaks, or ""adapted"" tracks from other music genres. Goa trance preceded psytrance; when digital media became more commonly used psytrance evolved. Goa continues to develop alongside the other genres.","wikipedia","5.12"
"3.547","Public education","","State schools, called public schools in North America and many other countries, are generally primary or secondary schools mandated for or offered to all children without charge, funded in whole or in part by taxation.\nWhile such schools are to be found in virtually every country, there are significant variations in their structure and educational programs. State education generally encompasses primary and secondary education (kindergarten to twelfth grade, or equivalent), as well as post-secondary educational institutions such as universities, colleges, and technical schools that are funded and overseen by government rather than by private entities. The position before there were government-funded schools varied: in many instances there was an established educational system which served a significant, albeit often elite, sector of the population; these systems were often funded by religious institutions. The introduction of government-organised schools was in some cases able to build upon this established system, and often both systems have continued to exist, sometimes in a parallel and complementary relationship and other times less harmoniously.","wikipedia","['5.5','5.0']"
"3.548","Puerto Ricans in the United States","","A Stateside Puerto Rican, also ambiguously Puerto Rican American (Spanish: puertorrique\u00f1o-americano, puertorrique\u00f1o-estadounidense), or Puerto Ricans in the United States is a term for residents in the continental United States and Hawaii who were born in or trace family ancestry to the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico.Puerto Ricans who were born in Puerto Rico are American citizens as if they were born in the United States proper. Consequently, using the term ""Puerto Rican American"" only for those living in a U.S. state or incorporated territory is inaccurate and misleading.\nAt 9.7% of the Latino population in the United States, Puerto Ricans are the second-largest Latino group nationwide, after Mexican-Americans, and are 1.77% of the entire population of the United States.Although the 2010 Census counted the number of Puerto Ricans living in the States at 4.6 million, estimates in 2018 show the Puerto Rican population to be 5.8 million.Despite newer migration trends, New York City continues to be home by a significant margin to the largest demographic and cultural center for Puerto Ricans in the United States, with Philadelphia having the second-largest community. The portmanteau ""Nuyorican"" refers to Puerto Ricans and their descendants in the New York City metropolitan area. A large portion of the Puerto Rican population in the United States resides in the Northeastern United States and Florida, with Holyoke, Massachusetts and Buenaventura Lakes, Florida having the highest percentages of Puerto Rican residents of any municipalities in the country. There are also significant Puerto Rican populations in the Chicago metropolitan area and the South Atlantic States, from Maryland to Georgia, and other states like Ohio, Texas, and California.\n\n","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.549","Puerto Rico","","Puerto Rico (Spanish for '""Rich Port""'; abbreviated PR), officially the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (Spanish: Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico, lit.\u2009""Free Associated State of Puerto Rico"") and briefly called Porto Rico, is an unincorporated territory of the United States located in the northeast Caribbean Sea, approximately 1,000 miles (1,600 km) southeast of Miami, Florida.\nAn archipelago among the Greater Antilles, located between the Dominican Republic and the US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico includes the eponymous main island and several smaller islands, such as Mona, Culebra, and Vieques. The capital and most populous city is San Juan. The territory's total population is approximately 3.4 million, more than 21 U.S. states. Spanish and English are the official languages of the executive branch of government, though Spanish predominates.Originally populated by the indigenous Ta\u00edno people, Puerto Rico was colonized by Spain following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1493. It was contested by the French, Dutch, and British, but remained a Spanish possession for the next four centuries. The island's cultural and demographic landscapes were shaped by the displacement and assimilation of the native population, the forced migration of African slaves, and settlement from the Canary Islands and Andalusia. In the Spanish Empire, Puerto Rico played a secondary but strategic role compared to wealthier colonies like Peru and New Spain. Spain's distant administrative control continued up to the end of the 19th century, producing a distinctive creole Hispanic culture and language that combined indigenous, African, and European elements. On September 23, 1868, Ram\u00f3n Emeterio Betances unleashed a revolt against Spanish rule, declaring for the first time the idea of Puerto Ricans as a distinct people, with right to sovereignty. This revolt, known as El Grito de Lares, was eventually put down by Spanish forces, but the movement continued. In 1898, following the Spanish\u2013American War, the United States acquired Puerto Rico under the terms of the Treaty of Paris. Since then, Puerto Rico has remained an unincorporated territorial possession, making it the world's oldest colony.Puerto Ricans have been citizens of the United States since 1917, and can move freely between the island and the mainland. As it is not a state, Puerto Rico does not have a vote in the United States Congress, which governs the territory with full jurisdiction under the Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act of 1950. However, Puerto Rico does have one non-voting member of the House called a Resident Commissioner. As residents of a U.S. territory, American citizens in Puerto Rico are disenfranchised at the national level and do not vote for the president or vice president of the United States, and only some residents pay federal income tax.  Like other territories and the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico does not have U.S. senators. Congress approved a local constitution in 1952, allowing U.S. citizens of the territory to elect a governor. Puerto Rico's future political status has consistently been a matter of significant debate.In early 2017, the Puerto Rican government-debt crisis posed serious problems for the government. The outstanding bond debt had climbed to $70 billion at a time of an unemployment rate of 12.4%. The debt had been increasing during a decade-long recession. This was the second major financial crisis to affect the island after the Great Depression when the U.S. government, in 1935, provided relief efforts through the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration. On May 3, 2017, Puerto Rico's financial oversight board in the U.S. District Court for Puerto Rico filed the debt restructuring petition which was made under Title III of PROMESA. By early August 2017, the debt was $72 billion with a 45% poverty rate.In late September 2017, Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico, causing devastating damage. The island's electrical grid was largely destroyed, provoking the largest power outage in American history. Recovery efforts were slow in the first few months, and over 200,000 residents had moved to the mainland state of Florida alone by late November 2017.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.550","Punk rock","","Punk rock (or simply punk) is a music genre that emerged in the mid-1970s. Rooted in 1960s garage rock, punk bands rejected the perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. They typically produced short, fast-paced songs with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through independent record labels.\nThe term ""punk rock"" was first used by American rock critics in the early 1970s to describe 1960s garage bands and certain subsequent acts they perceived as stylistic inheritors. When the movement now bearing the name developed from 1974 to 1976, acts such as Television, Patti Smith, and the Ramones in New York City; the Sex Pistols, the Clash, and the Damned in London; and the Saints in Brisbane formed its vanguard. As 1977 approached, punk became a major cultural phenomenon in the UK. It spawned a punk subculture expressing youthful rebellion through distinctive styles of clothing and adornment (such as deliberately offensive T-shirts, leather jackets, studded or spiked bands and jewelry, safety pins, and bondage and S&M clothes) and a variety of anti-authoritarian ideologies.\nIn 1977, the influence of the music and subculture became more pervasive, spreading worldwide, especially in England. It took root in a wide range of local scenes that often rejected affiliation with the mainstream. In the late 1970s, punk experienced a second wave as new acts that were not active during its formative years adopted the style. By the early 1980s, faster and more aggressive subgenres such as hardcore punk (e.g. Minor Threat), street punk (e.g. the Exploited), and anarcho-punk (e.g. Crass) became the predominant modes of punk rock. Musicians identifying with or inspired by punk also pursued other musical directions, giving rise to spinoffs such as post-punk, new wave, and later indie pop, alternative rock, and noise rock. By the 1990s, punk re-emerged into the mainstream with the success of punk rock and pop punk bands such as Green Day, Rancid, the Offspring, and Blink-182.\n\n","wikipedia","5.13"
"3.552","Quebec","","Quebec ( (listen); French: Qu\u00e9bec [keb\u025bk] (listen)) is one of the thirteen provinces and territories of Canada. It is bordered to the west by the province of Ontario and the bodies of water James Bay and Hudson Bay; to the north by Hudson Strait and Ungava Bay; to the east by the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and the province of Newfoundland and Labrador; and to the south by the province of New Brunswick and the U.S. states of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and New York. It also shares maritime borders with Nunavut, Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia. Quebec is Canada's largest province by area and its second-largest administrative division; only the territory of Nunavut is larger. It is historically and politically considered to be part of Central Canada (with Ontario).\nQuebec is the second-most populous province of Canada, after Ontario. It is the only one to have a predominantly French-speaking population, with French as the sole provincial official language. Most inhabitants live in urban areas near the Saint Lawrence River between Montreal and Quebec City, the capital. Approximately half of Quebec residents live in the Greater Montreal Area, including the Island of Montreal. English-speaking communities and English-language institutions are concentrated in the west of the island of Montreal but are also significantly present in the Outaouais, Eastern Townships, and Gasp\u00e9 regions. The Nord-du-Qu\u00e9bec region, occupying the northern half of the province, is sparsely populated and inhabited primarily by Aboriginal peoples.The climate around the major cities is four-seasons continental with cold and snowy winters combined with warm to hot humid summers, but farther north long winter seasons dominate and as a result the northern areas of the province are marked by tundra conditions. Even in central Quebec, at comparatively southerly latitudes, winters are severe in inland areas.\nQuebec independence debates have played a large role in the politics of the province. Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois governments held referendums on sovereignty in 1980 and 1995. Although neither passed, the 1995 referendum saw the highest voter turnout in Quebec history, at over 93%, and only failed by less than 1%. In 2006, the House of Commons of Canada passed a symbolic motion recognizing the ""Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois as a nation within a united Canada"".While the province's substantial natural resources have long been the mainstay of its economy, sectors of the knowledge economy such as aerospace, information and communication technologies, biotechnology, and the pharmaceutical industry also play leading roles. These many industries have all contributed to helping Quebec become an economically influential province within Canada, second only to Ontario in economic output.","wikipedia","['5.5','5.10']"
"3.553","Quebec sovereignty movement","","The Quebec sovereignty movement (French: Mouvement souverainiste du Qu\u00e9bec) is a political movement as well as an ideology of values, concepts and ideas that advocates independence for the Canadian province of Quebec.\nSeveral diverse political groups coalesced in the late 1960s in the formation of the Parti qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, a provincial political party. Since 1968 the party has appealed for constitutional negotiations on the matter of provincial sovereignty, in addition to holding two provincial referendums on the matter. The first, which occurred in 1980, asked whether Quebecers wished to open constitutional negotiations with the federal government (and other provinces) for the intended purpose of establishing a ""sovereignty-association"" pact between the province of Quebec and the rest of Canada. Approximately 60% of Quebec's voting public rejected the idea put forth by Parti qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois leader Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque. The matter was dropped by the party for most of the 1980s, especially after the patriation of the Canadian constitution without the consent of the Parti qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois government, and the creation of the federal Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which enshrined the protection of the French language and French-Canadian culture in Canada. In 1995, after two failed attempts by the Mulroney government to secure Quebec's ratification of amendments to the constitution, the Parti qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois held a second referendum, though on this occasion the question was whether one wished for the independence of the province of Quebec from the rest of Canada. The response was again in the negative, though this time by a far closer margin, with 50.58% against the proposal.\nThough the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois has long spearheaded the sovereignty movement, it is not alone. Other minority provincial political parties, such as Option nationale and Qu\u00e9bec solidaire, also supported sovereignty, but were not always supportive of the Parti qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (the two parties merged in 2017). It should also be noted that, on the federal level, another party, the Bloc qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, also support the independance of the province. The Quebec Liberal Party, Quebec's other primary political party until the 2018 provincial elections, is opposed to increasing political sovereignty for the province, but has also been historically at odds, on occasion, with various Canadian federal governments. Thus, the Quebec politic scene was effectively divided into two camps, principally opposed over the sovereignty issue, until 2018 (on that year the Coalition avenir Qu\u00e9bec, an autonomist party, took power). Quebec sovereignty is politically opposed to the competing ideology of Canadian federalism.\nMost groups within this movement seek to gain independence through peaceful means, using negotiation-based diplomatic intervention, although fringe groups have advocated and used violent means. The overwhelming number of casualties came from attacks by the Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec (FLQ), a militant organization which perpetrated a bombing and armed robbery campaign from 1963 to 1970, culminating in the October Crisis and the death of Deputy Premier Pierre Laporte. Since this time all mainstream sovereignist groups have sworn off violence, while extremist nationalist groups, though in the minority, support violent actions in the name of liberating Quebec from Canadian sovereignty.\nThe primary mainstream political vehicle for the movement is the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, which has governed Quebec on multiple occasions. In 2012 it was elected to a minority government, in which its leader, Pauline Marois, became the first female Premier of Quebec. However, only eighteen months later, the PQ was defeated by the Liberal Party of Quebec in the 2014 election.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.551","Qu'ran","","The Quran ( kor-AHN; Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0622\u0646\u200e, romanized: al-Qur\u02bc\u0101n Arabic pronunciation: [alqur'\u0294a\u02d0n], literally meaning ""the recitation""), also romanized Qur'an or Koran, is the central religious text of Islam, which Muslims believe to be a revelation from God (Allah). It is widely regarded as the finest work in classical Arabic literature. Slightly shorter than the New Testament, it is organized in 114 chapters (Arabic: \u0633\u0648\u0631\u0629 s\u016brah, plural \u0633\u0648\u0631 suwar) \u2014 not according to chronology or subject matter, but according to length of surahs (with some exceptions).

Muslims regard the Quran as Muhammad's most important miracle, a proof of his prophethood, and the culmination of a series of divine messages starting with those revealed to Adam, including the Tawrah (Torah), the Zabur (""Psalms"") and the Injil (""Gospel""), and ending with Muhammad's revelation. The word ""Quran"" occurs some 70 times in the Quran's text, and other names and words are also said to refer to the Quran. It is thought by Muslims to be not simply divinely inspired, but the literal word of God.According to tradition, several of Muhammad's companions served as scribes and recorded the revelations. Shortly after his death, the Quran was compiled by the companions, who had written down or memorized parts of it. The codices showed differences that motivated Caliph Uthman to establish a standard version, now known as Uthman's codex, which is generally considered the archetype of the Quran known today. There are, however, variant readings, with mostly minor differences in meaning.The Quran assumes familiarity with major narratives recounted in the Biblical scriptures. It summarizes some, dwells at length on others and, in some cases, presents alternative accounts and interpretations of events. The Quran describes itself as a book of guidance for mankind (2:185). It sometimes offers detailed accounts of specific historical events, and it often emphasizes the moral significance of an event over its narrative sequence. Supplementing the Quran with  explanations for some cryptic Quranic narratives, and rulings that also provide the basis for sharia (Islamic) law (in most denominations of Islam), are Hadith \u2014 oral and written traditions believed to describe words and actions of Muhammad.  During prayers, the Quran is recited only in Arabic.Someone who has memorized the entire Quran is called a hafiz. Quranic verse (ayah) is sometimes recited with a special kind of elocution reserved for this purpose, called tajwid. During the month of Ramadan, Muslims typically complete the recitation of the whole Quran during tarawih prayers. In order to extrapolate the meaning of a particular Quranic verse, most Muslims rely on exegesis, or tafsir.","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.556","Race and intelligence","","The connection between race and intelligence has been a subject of debate in both popular science and academic research since the inception of IQ testing in the early 20th century. Since then, there have been observed differences between average IQ scores of different population groups, but whether and to what extent these differences reflect environmental factors as opposed to genetic ones, as well as what the definitions of ""race"" and ""intelligence"" are, and whether they can be objectively defined, is the subject of much debate. At present, there is no non-circumstantial evidence that these differences in test scores have a genetic component, although some researchers believe that the existing circumstantial evidence makes it at least plausible that hard evidence for a genetic component will eventually be found.\nThe first tests showing differences in IQ scores between different population groups in the United States were the tests of United States Army recruits in World War I. In the 1920s, groups of eugenics lobbyists argued that this demonstrated that African-Americans and certain immigrant groups were of inferior intellect to Anglo-Saxon white people, due to innate biological differences, using this as an argument for policies of racial segregation. However, soon, other studies appeared, contesting these conclusions and arguing instead that the Army tests had not adequately controlled for environmental factors, such as socio-economic and educational inequality between black people and white people. Later observations of phenomena such as the Flynn effect have also suggested that environmental factors play a greater role in group IQ differences than previously expected. \nThe causes of differences in IQ test scores are not well-understood, and the topic remains controversial among researchers.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.554","Race (classification of human beings)","","A race is a grouping of humans based on shared physical or social qualities into categories generally viewed as distinct by society. The term was first used to refer to speakers of a common language and then to denote national affiliations. By the 17th century the term began to refer to physical (phenotypical) traits. Modern scholarship regards race as a social construct, an identity which is assigned based on rules made by society. While partially based on physical similarities within groups, race does not have an inherent physical or biological meaning.Social conceptions and groupings of races vary over time, involving folk taxonomies that define essential types of individuals based on perceived traits. Scientists consider biological essentialism obsolete, and generally discourage racial explanations for collective differentiation in both physical and behavioral traits.Even though there is a broad scientific agreement that essentialist and typological conceptualizations of race are untenable, scientists around the world continue to conceptualize race in widely differing ways, some of which have essentialist implications. While some researchers use the concept of race to make distinctions among fuzzy sets of traits or observable differences in behaviour, others in the scientific community suggest that the idea of race often is used in a naive or simplistic way, and argue that, among humans, race has no taxonomic significance by pointing out that all living humans belong to the same species, Homo sapiens, and (as far as applicable) subspecies, Homo sapiens sapiens.Since the second half of the 20th century, the association of race with the ideologies and theories of scientific racism has led to the use of the word race itself becoming problematic. Although still used in general contexts, race has often been replaced by less ambiguous and loaded terms: populations, people(s), ethnic groups, or communities, depending on context.","wikipedia","5.8"

"3.557","Race relations","","Race relations is a concept which emerged in Chicago following the Chicago race riot of 1919. In the wake of this violence the city authorities established the Chicago Commission on Race Relations. This was composed entirely of men, six African-Americans and six European-Americans.However it was through the establishment of the Department of Social Anthropology under the leadership of Kenneth Little at the University of Edinburgh, that the concept became institutionally significant in the United Kingdom.\n\n","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.558","Racial quota","","Racial quotas in employment and education are numerical requirements for hiring, promoting, admitting and/or graduating members of a particular racial group. Racial quotas are often established as means of diminishing racial discrimination, addressing under-representation and evident racism against those racial groups or, the opposite, against the disadvantaged majority group (see numerus clausus or bhumiputra systems).\nThese quotas may be determined by governmental authority and backed by governmental sanctions. When the total number of jobs or enrollment slots is fixed, this proportion may get translated to a specific number.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.559","Racism","","Racism is the belief that groups of humans possess different behavioral traits corresponding to physical appearance, and can be divided based on the superiority of one race over another. It may also mean prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against other people because they are of a different race or ethnicity. Modern variants of racism are often based in social perceptions of biological differences between peoples. These views can take the form of social actions, practices or beliefs, or political systems in which different races are ranked as inherently superior or inferior to each other, based on presumed shared inheritable traits, abilities, or qualities.In terms of political systems (e.g., apartheid) that support the expression of prejudice or aversion in discriminatory practices or laws, racist ideology may include associated social aspects such as nativism, xenophobia, otherness, segregation, hierarchical ranking, and supremacism.\nWhile the concepts of race and ethnicity are considered to be separate in contemporary social science, the two terms have a long history of equivalence in popular usage and older social science literature. ""Ethnicity"" is often used in a sense close to one traditionally attributed to ""race"": the division of human groups based on qualities assumed to be essential or innate to the group (e.g. shared ancestry or shared behavior). Therefore, racism and racial discrimination are often used to describe discrimination on an ethnic or cultural basis, independent of whether these differences are described as racial. According to a United Nations convention on racial discrimination, there is no distinction between the terms ""racial"" and ""ethnic"" discrimination. The UN Convention further concludes that superiority based on racial differentiation is scientifically false, morally condemnable, socially unjust and dangerous. The Convention also declared that there is no justification for racial discrimination, anywhere, in theory or in practice.Racism is a relatively modern concept, arising in the European age of imperialism, the subsequent growth of capitalism, and especially the Atlantic slave trade, of which it was a major driving force.  It was also a major force behind racial segregation especially in the United States in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and South Africa under apartheid; 19th and 20th century racism in Western culture is particularly well documented and constitutes a reference point in studies and discourses about racism.  Racism has played a role in genocides such as the Holocaust, and the Armenian genocide, and colonial projects like the European colonization of the Americas, Africa, and Asia. Indigenous peoples have been\u2014and are\u2014often subject to racist attitudes.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.560","Radical right (United States)","","In United States politics, the radical right is a political preference that leans towards extreme conservatism, anti-socialism, and other right-wing beliefs in hierarchical structure. The term was first used by social scientists in the 1950s regarding small groups such as the John Birch Society in the United States and since then it has been applied to similar groups worldwide.The term ""radical"" was applied to the groups because they sought to make fundamental (hence ""radical"")  changes within institutions and remove from political life persons and institutions that threatened their values or economic interests.  They were called ""right-wing"" primarily because of their opposition to socialism, communism, Marxism, anarchism, social democracy, progressivism and liberalism and their ultraconservative or reactionary tendencies which limited new access to power and status.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.561","Rap","","Rapping (or rhyming, spitting, emceeing, MCing) is a musical form of vocal delivery that incorporates ""rhyme, rhythmic speech, and street vernacular"", which is performed or chanted in a variety of ways, usually over a backing beat or musical accompaniment.  The components of rap include ""content"" (what is being said), ""flow"" (rhythm, rhyme), and ""delivery"" (cadence, tone). Rap differs from spoken-word poetry in that it is usually performed in time to musical accompaniment. Rap being a primary ingredient of hip hop music, it is commonly associated with that genre in particular; however, the origins of rap precede hip-hop culture. The earliest precursor to modern rap is the West African griot tradition, in which ""oral historians"", or ""praise-singers"", would disseminate oral traditions and genealogies, or use their rhetorical techniques for gossip or to ""praise or critique individuals."" Griot traditions connect to rap along a lineage of black verbal reverence, through James Brown interacting with the crowd and the band between songs, to Muhammad Ali's verbal taunts and the poems of The Last Poets. Therefore, rap lyrics and music are part of the ""Black rhetorical continuum"", and aim to reuse elements of past traditions while expanding upon them through ""creative use of language and rhetorical styles and strategies"". The person credited with originating the style of ""delivering rhymes over extensive music"", that would become known as rap, was Anthony ""DJ Hollywood"" Holloway from Harlem, New York.Rap is usually delivered over a beat, typically provided by a DJ, turntablist, beatboxer, or performed a cappella without accompaniment. Stylistically, rap occupies a gray area between speech, prose, poetry, and singing. The word, which predates the musical form, originally meant ""to lightly strike"", and is now used to describe quick speech or repartee. The word had been used in British English since the 16th century. It was part of the African American dialect of English in the 1960s meaning ""to converse"", and very soon after that in its present usage as a term denoting the musical style. Today, the term rap is so closely associated with hip-hop music that many writers use the terms interchangeably.","wikipedia","5.13"
"3.562","Rape","","Rape is a type of sexual assault usually involving sexual intercourse or other forms of sexual penetration carried out against a person without that person's consent. The act may be carried out by physical force, coercion, abuse of authority, or against a person who is incapable of giving valid consent, such as one who is unconscious, incapacitated, has an intellectual disability or is below the legal age of consent. The term rape is sometimes used interchangeably with the term sexual assault.The rate of reporting, prosecuting and convicting for rape varies between jurisdictions. Internationally, the incidence of rapes recorded by the police during 2008 ranged, per 100,000 people, from 0.2 in Azerbaijan to 92.9 in Botswana with 6.3 in Lithuania as the median. Worldwide, rape is primarily committed by males against females. Rape by strangers is usually less common than rape by people the victim knows, and male-on-male and female-on-female prison rapes are common and may be the least reported forms of rape.Widespread and systematic rape (e.g., war rape) and sexual slavery can occur during international conflict. These practices are crimes against humanity and war crimes. Rape is also recognized as an element of the crime of genocide when committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a targeted ethnic group.\nPeople who have been raped can be traumatized and develop posttraumatic stress disorder. Serious injuries can result along with the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. A person may face violence or threats from the rapist, and, in some cultures, from the victim's family and relatives.","wikipedia","5.7"
"3.563","Rape during the occupation of Germany","","As Allied troops entered and occupied German territory during the later stages of World War II, mass rapes of women took place both in connection with combat operations and during the subsequent occupation. Most Western scholars agree that the majority of the rapes were committed by Soviet servicemen, while some Russian historians maintain that these crimes were not widespread. The wartime rapes had been surrounded by decades of silence. According to Antony Beevor, whose books were banned in 2015 from some Russian schools and colleges, NKVD (Soviet secret police) files have revealed that the leadership knew what was happening, but did little to stop it. Some Russian historians disagree, claiming that the Soviet leadership took some action.\n\n","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.564","Rave","","A rave (from the verb: to rave) is an organized dance party at a nightclub. The word also means excellent, great, or brilliant, and can be used to describe any genre of music and entertainment. It can also be an outdoor festival, warehouse, or other private property typically featuring performances by DJs, playing a seamless flow of electronic dance music; at its broadest definition, ""rave"" can be used to describe many forms of music, not limited to just rave music- which is why fusion genres exist, even within rave music itself. DJs at rave events play electronic dance music on vinyl, CDs and digital audio from a wide range of genres, including techno, hardcore, house, bassline, dubstep, New Beat and post-industrial. Occasionally live musicians have been known to perform at raves, in addition to other types of performance artists such as go-go dancers and fire dancers. The music is amplified with a large, powerful sound reinforcement system, typically with large subwoofers to produce a deep bass sound. The music is often accompanied by laser light shows, projected coloured images, visual effects and fog machines.\nWhile some raves may be small parties held at nightclubs or private homes, some raves have grown to immense size, such as the large festivals and events featuring multiple DJs and dance areas (e.g., the Castlemorton Common Festival in 1992). Some electronic dance music festivals have features of raves, but on a larger, often commercial scale. Raves may last for a long time, with some events continuing for twenty-four hours, and lasting all through the night. Law enforcement raids and anti-rave laws have presented a challenge to the rave scene in many countries. This is due to the association of illegal drugs such as MDMA (often referred to as a ""club drug"" or ""party drug"" along with MDA), LSD, GHB, ketamine, methamphetamine, cocaine, and cannabis. In addition to drugs, raves often make use of non-authorized, secret venues, such as squat parties at unoccupied homes, unused warehouses, or aircraft hangars. These concerns are often attributed to a type of moral panic surrounding rave culture.","wikipedia","5.13"
"3.565","Recapitulation theory","","The theory of recapitulation, also called the biogenetic law or embryological parallelism\u2014often expressed using Ernst Haeckel's phrase  ""ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny""\u2014is a historical hypothesis that the development of the embryo of an animal, from fertilization to gestation or hatching (ontogeny), goes through stages resembling or representing successive adult stages in the evolution of the animal's remote ancestors (phylogeny). It was formulated in the 1820s by  \u00c9tienne Serres  based on the work of Johann Friedrich Meckel, after whom it is also known as Meckel\u2013Serres law.\nSince embryos also evolve in different ways, the shortcomings of the theory had been recognized by the early 20th century, and it had been relegated to ""biological mythology"" by the mid-20th century.Analogies to recapitulation theory have been formulated in other fields, including cognitive development and music criticism.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.566","Recession","","In economics, a recession is a business cycle contraction when there is a general decline in economic activity. Recessions generally occur when there is a widespread drop in spending (an adverse demand shock). This may be triggered by various events, such as a financial crisis, an external trade shock, an adverse supply shock or the bursting of an economic bubble. In the United States, it is defined as ""a significant decline in economic activity spread across the market, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales"". In the United Kingdom, it is defined as a negative economic growth for two consecutive quarters.Governments usually respond to recessions by adopting expansionary macroeconomic policies, such as increasing money supply or increasing government spending and decreasing taxation","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.567","Recycling","","Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects. It is an alternative to ""conventional"" waste disposal that can save material and help lower greenhouse gas emissions. Recycling can prevent the waste of potentially useful materials and reduce the consumption of fresh raw materials, thereby reducing: energy usage, air pollution (from incineration), and water pollution (from landfilling).\nRecycling is a key component of modern waste reduction and is the third component of the ""Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle"" waste hierarchy. Thus, recycling aims at environmental sustainability by substituting raw material inputs into and redirecting waste outputs out of the economic system.There are some ISO standards related to recycling such as ISO 15270:2008 for plastics waste and ISO 14001:2015 for environmental management control of recycling practice.\nRecyclable materials include many kinds of glass, paper, cardboard, metal, plastic, tires, textiles, batteries, and electronics. The composting or other reuse of biodegradable waste\u2014such as food or garden waste\u2014is also a form of recycling. Materials to be recycled are either delivered to a household recycling center or picked up from curbside bins, then sorted, cleaned, and reprocessed into new materials destined for manufacturing new products.\nIn the strictest sense, recycling of a material would produce a fresh supply of the same material\u2014for example, used office paper would be converted into new office paper or used polystyrene foam into new polystyrene. This is accomplished when recycling certain types of materials, such as metal cans, which can become a can again and again, indefinitely, without losing purity in the product. However, this is often difficult or too expensive (compared with producing the same product from raw materials or other sources), so ""recycling"" of many products or materials involves their reuse in producing different materials (for example, paperboard) instead. Another form of recycling is the salvage of certain materials from complex products, either due to their intrinsic value (such as lead from car batteries, or gold from printed circuit boards), or due to their hazardous nature (e.g., removal and reuse of mercury from thermometers and thermostats).","wikipedia","5.9"
"3.568","Reincarnation research","","Reincarnation is the philosophical  or religious concept that the non-physical essence of a living being starts a new life in a different physical form or body after biological death. It is also called rebirth or transmigration.Reincarnation is a central tenet of Indian religions, namely Jainism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Hinduism, although there are Hindu groups that do not believe in reincarnation but believe in an afterlife. It is an esoteric belief in many streams of Orthodox Judaism and is found (in different forms) in some beliefs of North American Natives and some Native Australians (while most believe in an afterlife or spirit world). A belief in rebirth/metempsychosis was held by Greek historic figures, such as Pythagoras, Socrates, and Plato. It is also a belief in various modern religions. Although the majority of denominations within Christianity and Islam do not believe that individuals reincarnate, particular groups within these religions do refer to reincarnation; these groups include the mainstream historical and contemporary followers of Cathars, Alawites, the Druze, and the Rosicrucians. The historical relations between these sects and the beliefs about reincarnation that were characteristic of Neoplatonism, Orphism, Hermeticism, Manicheanism, and Gnosticism of the Roman era as well as the Indian religions have been the subject of recent scholarly research. In recent decades, many Europeans and North Americans have developed an interest in reincarnation, and many contemporary works mention it.\n\n","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.569","Religion and sexuality","","The views of religions and religious believers range widely, from giving sex and sexuality a rather negative connotation to believing that sex is the highest expression of the divine. Some religions distinguish between sexual activities that are practised for biological reproduction (sometimes allowed only when in formal marital status and at a certain age) and those practised only for sexual pleasure in evaluating relative morality.","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.570","Removal of Internet Explorer","","The idea of the removal of Internet Explorer (IE) from Windows was proposed during the United States v. Microsoft Corp. case. Later, security advocates took up the idea as a way to protect Windows systems from attacks via IE vulnerabilities.\nThe process of removing Internet Explorer from a personal computer has changed over the browser's version history, but the nature of many of its upgrades and installation methods has been a matter of public interest. The first version to be included was version 2 with Windows 95 in late 1996. Later, users who upgraded to IE3 (which came out in 1996), could still use the last IE, because the installation converted the previous version to separate directory. However, Internet Explorer 4 created a controversy with its shell integration with Windows Explorer. With later versions removal (or inability to do so) became more complicated. With the release of Internet Explorer 7, shell integration began being reduced, such as changing ActiveX hosting and a different look than Windows Explorer.\nIt was proposed that a special version of Windows 7, Windows 7 E, would be shipped without Internet Explorer in Europe as a result of EU antitrust investigations against Microsoft. However, in July 2009, Microsoft cancelled the Windows 7 E editions due to negative reactions from computer manufacturers. In 2015, Microsoft released Microsoft Edge, which replaced IE's status as the default browser in Windows 10. IE 11 is still available and preinstalled on Windows 10, but users setting up their computers for the first time have to actively seek it from the Windows Accessories folder in the Start menu since it is not pinned to the taskbar by default.","wikipedia","5.4"
"3.571","Republican Party (United States)","","The Republican Party, also referred to as the GOP (Grand Old Party), is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States, along with its main rival, the Democratic Party.\nThe GOP was founded in 1854 by opponents of the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act, which allowed for the potential expansion of slavery into certain U.S. territories. The party supported classical liberalism, opposed the expansion of slavery, and supported economic reform. Abraham Lincoln was the first Republican president. Under the leadership of Lincoln and a Republican Congress, slavery was banned in the United States in 1865. The Party was generally dominant during the Third Party System and the Fourth Party System. After 1912, the Party underwent an ideological shift to the right. Following the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the party's core base shifted, with Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics. The party's 21st-century base of support includes people living in rural areas, men, people without college degrees, the elderly, white Americans, and evangelical Christians.The 21st-century Republican Party ideology is American conservatism, which incorporates both economic policies and social values. The GOP supports lower taxes, free market capitalism, restrictions on immigration, increased military spending, gun rights, restrictions on abortion, deregulation and restrictions on labor unions. After the Supreme Court's 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade, the Republican Party opposed abortion in its party platform and grew its support among evangelicals. The GOP was strongly committed to protectionism and tariffs at its founding, but grew more supportive of free trade in the 20th century, although tariffs experienced a resurgence in the 21st century.\nThere have been 19 Republican presidents (including incumbent president Donald Trump, who was elected in 2016), the most from any one political party. As of 2020, the GOP controls the presidency, a majority in the U.S. Senate, a majority of state governorships, a majority (30) of state legislatures, and 21 state government trifectas (governorship and both legislative chambers). Five of the nine sitting U.S. Supreme Court justices were nominated by Republican presidents.","wikipedia","['5.5','5.1']"

Its largest city and administrative centre is Banja Luka, lying on the Vrbas river.\nThe entity encompasses most of the Bosnian Serb-populated portions of Bosnia and Herzegovina situated in the densely forested north and east of the country. Formed in 1992 at the outset of the breakup of Yugoslavia, Republika Srpska, following the Dayton Accords, achieved international recognition as part of a federal Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nToday, Republika Srpska maintains a parliamentary-style government, with the National Assembly holding legislative power within the entity. Republika Srpska is relatively centralised, although it is split into 2nd-level administrative units\u2014municipalities, or op\u0161tine\u2014of which there are 64.

"3.573","Rh blood group system","","The Rh blood group system is one of 36 known human blood group systems. It is the second most important blood group system, after the ABO blood group system. The Rh blood group system consists of 49 defined blood group antigens, among which the five antigens D, C, c, E, and e are the most important. There is no d antigen. Rh(D) status of an individual is normally described with a positive or negative suffix after the ABO type (e.g., someone who is A Positive has the A antigen and the Rh(D) antigen, whereas someone who is A Negative lacks the Rh(D) antigen). The terms Rh factor, Rh positive, and Rh negative refer to the Rh(D) antigen only. Antibodies to Rh antigens can be involved in hemolytic transfusion reactions and antibodies to the Rh(D) and Rh(c) antigens confer significant risk of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn.\nThe term ""Rh"" was originally an abbreviation of ""Rhesus factor."" It was discovered in 1937 by Karl Landsteiner and Alexander S. Wiener, who, at the time, believed it to be a similar antigen found in rhesus monkey red blood cells. It was subsequently learned the human factor is not identical to the rhesus monkey factor, but by then, ""Rhesus Group"" and like terms were already in widespread, worldwide use. Thus, notwithstanding it is a misnomer, the term survives (e.g., rhesus blood group system and the obsolete terms rhesus factor,  rhesus positive, and rhesus negative \u2013 all three of which actually refer specifically and only to the Rh D factor and are thus misleading when unmodified). Contemporary practice is to use ""Rh"" as a term of art instead of ""Rhesus"" (e.g., ""Rh Group,"" ""Rh factors,"" ""Rh D,"" etc.).","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.574","Right-wing populism","","Right-wing populism, also called national populism or right-wing nationalism, is a political ideology which combines right-wing politics and populist rhetoric and themes. The rhetoric often consists of anti-elitist sentiments, opposition to the perceived Establishment, and speaking to the ""common people"". Both right-wing populism and left-wing populism object to the perceived control of liberal democracies by elites; however, populism of the left also objects to the power of large corporations and their allies, while populism of the right normally supports strong controls on immigration.In Europe, the term right-wing populism is used to describe groups, politicians and political parties that are generally known for their opposition to immigration, especially from the Islamic world, and for Euroscepticism. Right-wing populism in the Western world is generally associated with ideologies such as anti-environmentalism, neo-nationalism, anti-globalization, nativism, and protectionism. European right-wing populists also typically support expanding the welfare state, but barring undocumented immigrants from receiving government benefits; this concept has been referred to as ""welfare chauvinism"".From the 1990s, right-wing populist parties became established in the legislatures of various democracies. Although extreme right-wing movements in the United States (where they are normally referred to as the ""radical right"") have been studied separately, some writers consider them to be a part of the right-wing populist phenomenon. Right-wing populism in the United States is also closely linked to paleoconservatism.Since the Great Recession, right-wing populist movements such as the National Rally (formerly the National Front) in France, the League in Italy, the Party for Freedom and the Forum for Democracy in the Netherlands, the UK Independence Party and the Brexit Party began to grow in popularity, in large part due to increasing opposition to immigration from the Middle East and Africa, rising Euroscepticism and discontent with the economic policies of the European Union. U.S. President Donald Trump won the 2016 United States presidential election after running on a platform that included right-wing populist themes.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.575","Riksmål","","Riksm\u00e5l is a written Norwegian language form or spelling standard, meaning the National Language, closely related and now almost identical to the dominant form of Bokm\u00e5l, known as Moderate Bokm\u00e5l.\nBoth Bokm\u00e5l and Riksm\u00e5l evolved from the Danish written language as used in Norway during the countries' union and beyond, and from the pronunciation of Danish that became the native language of Norwegian elites by the 18th century. By the late 19th century the main written language became known as Rigsm\u00e5l in both Denmark and Norway; the written language in Norway remained identical to Danish until 1907, although it was generally known as ""Norwegian"" in Norway. From 1907 successive spelling reforms gradually introduced some orthographic differences between written Norwegian and Danish. The name Riksm\u00e5l was adopted as the official name of the language, to differentiate it from Landsm\u00e5l (now Nynorsk); in 1929 the name of the official language was changed to Bokm\u00e5l.\nFrom 1938, spelling reforms introduced by the Labour government met increasing resistance as they were seen as ""radical"", and language organisations independent of the state started publishing their own spelling standard known as Riksm\u00e5l. The struggle between Bokm\u00e5l and Riksm\u00e5l eventually led to the Norwegian language struggle that was at its most intensive in the 1950s and 1960s. As a result the ""Language Peace Committee"" was appointed by the government, and subsequent reforms have moved Bokm\u00e5l and Riksm\u00e5l closer together, to the extent that few differences remain. Riksm\u00e5l and Bokm\u00e5l were clearly separate spelling standards until a major reform of Bokm\u00e5l in 2005 that (re)introduced numerous Riksm\u00e5l forms as part of Bokm\u00e5l; some subsequent reforms in the 21st century have eradicated most remaining, mostly small differences.

"3.577","Romani people","","The Romani (also spelled Romany , ), colloquially known as Roma, are an Indo-Aryan ethnic group, traditionally itinerant, living mostly in Europe and the Americas. The Romani originate from the northern Indian subcontinent, from the Rajasthan, Haryana, and Punjab regions of modern-day India.Genetic findings appear to confirm that the Romani ""came from a single group that left northwestern India"" in about 512 AD. Genetic research published in the European Journal of Human Genetics ""revealed that over 70% of males belong to a single lineage that appears unique to the Roma"". They are dispersed, but their most concentrated populations are located in Europe, especially Central, Eastern and Southern Europe (including Turkey, Spain and Southern France). The Romani arrived in Mid-West Asia and Europe around 1007. They have been associated with another Indo-Aryan group, the Dom people: the two groups have been said to have separated from each other or, at least, to share a similar history. Specifically, the ancestors of both the Romani and the Dom left North India sometime between the 6th and 11th century.The Romani are widely known in English by the exonym Gypsies (or Gipsies), which is considered by some Roma people to be pejorative due to its connotations of illegality and irregularity. Beginning in 1888, the Gypsy Lore Society started to publish a journal that was meant to dispel rumors about their lifestyle.Since the 19th century, some Romani have also migrated to the Americas. There are an estimated one million Roma in the United States; and 800,000 in Brazil, most of whose ancestors emigrated in the 19th century from Eastern Europe. Brazil also includes a notable Romani community descended from people deported by the Portuguese Empire during the Portuguese Inquisition. In migrations since the late 19th century, Romani have also moved to other countries in South America and to Canada.In February 2016, during the International Roma Conference, the Indian Minister of External Affairs stated that the people of the Roma community were children of India. The conference ended with a recommendation to the government of India to recognize the Roma community spread across 30 countries as a part of the Indian diaspora.The Romani language is divided into several dialects which together have an estimated number of speakers of more than two million. The total number of Romani people is at least twice as high (several times as high according to high estimates). Many Romani are native speakers of the dominant language in their country of residence or of mixed languages combining the dominant language with a dialect of Romani; those varieties are sometimes called Para-Romani.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.578","Roswell UFO incident","","In mid-1947, a United States Army Air Forces balloon crashed at a ranch near Roswell, New Mexico. Following wide initial interest in the crashed ""flying disc"", the US military stated that it was merely a conventional weather balloon. Interest subsequently waned until the late 1970s, when ufologists began promoting a variety of increasingly elaborate conspiracy theories, claiming that one or more alien spacecraft had crash-landed and that the extraterrestrial occupants had been recovered by the military, which then engaged in a cover-up.\nIn the 1990s, the US military published two reports disclosing the true nature of the crashed object: a nuclear test surveillance balloon from Project Mogul. Nevertheless, the Roswell incident continues to be of interest in popular media, and conspiracy theories surrounding the event persist. Roswell has been described as ""the world's most famous, most exhaustively investigated, and most thoroughly debunked UFO claim"".","wikipedia","5.6"

In 1920 the bilateral relationship between two countries was changed as Ukraine was conquered by the Russian Red Army. In 1990s immediately upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union, of which both Soviet Russia and Soviet Ukraine had been formally founding constituent republics, bilateral relations were revived. Relations between the two countries collapsed since \n2014 Ukrainian revolution, followed by Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, and over Russia's backing for the separatists fighters of the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic in a war that by early 2020 had killed more than 13,000 people and brought Western sanctions on Russia.","wikipedia","5.6"

He is known for his creation and portrayal of several fictional satirical characters, including Ali G, Borat Sagdiyev, Br\u00fcno Gehard and Admiral General Aladeen. Like his idol Peter Sellers, Baron Cohen adopts a variety of accents and guises for his characters. He interacts with unsuspecting subjects, who do not realise they have been set up for self-revealing ridicule. On these interactions, The Observer states, ""his career has been built on winding people up, while keeping a deadpan face"".Baron Cohen's other work includes voicing King Julien XIII in the Madagascar film series (2005\u20132012) and appearing in films such as Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (2006), Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007), Hugo (2011), and Les Mis\u00e9rables (2012). He made a cameo as a BBC News Anchor in Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues (2013). In 2016, Baron Cohen appeared in the comedy film Grimsby and co-starred in the fantasy sequel Alice Through the Looking Glass. Two years later, he created and starred in Who Is America? (2018) for Showtime, his first television project since Da Ali G Show, for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Musical or Comedy.

After the release of Borat, Baron Cohen said he would retire Borat and Ali G because the public had become too familiar with the characters. After the release of Br\u00fcno, he said he would retire that character. At the 2012 British Comedy Awards, he received the Outstanding Achievement Award, accepting the award while reprising his Ali G character. In 2013, he received the BAFTA Charlie Chaplin Britannia Award for Excellence in Comedy.In 2018, The Times named Baron Cohen among the 30 best living comedians, and in 2019 a panel on the television channel Gold included him in a list of the greatest ever British comedians.","wikipedia","5.13"
"3.581","Sadomasochism","","Sadomasochism ( SAY-doh-MASS-\u0259-kiz-\u0259m) is the giving or receiving of pleasure from acts involving the receipt or infliction of pain or humiliation. Practitioners of sadomasochism may seek sexual gratification from their acts. While the terms sadist and masochist refer respectively to one who enjoys giving and receiving pain, practitioners of sadomasochism may switch between activity and passivity.\nThe word sadomasochism is a portmanteau of the words sadism () and masochism. The abbreviation S&M is often used for Sadomasochism (or Sadism & Masochism), although practitioners themselves normally remove the ampersand and use the acronym S-M or SM or S/M when written throughout the literature. Sadomasochism is not considered a clinical paraphilia unless such practices lead to clinically significant distress or impairment for a diagnosis. Similarly, sexual sadism within the context of mutual consent, generally known under the heading BDSM, is distinguished from non-consensual acts of sexual violence or aggression.","wikipedia","5.7"

As a life-long committed member of the Socialist Party of Chile, whose foundation he had actively contributed to, he unsuccessfully ran for the national presidency in the 1952, 1958, and 1964 elections. In 1970, he won the presidency in a close three-way race. He was elected in a run-off by Congress as no candidate had gained a majority.\nOn 11 September 1973, the military moved to oust Allende in a coup d'\u00e9tat supported by the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). As troops surrounded La Moneda Palace, he gave his last speech vowing not to resign. Later that day, Allende committed suicide with an AK-47 rifle gifted to him by Fidel Castro, according to an investigation conducted by a Chilean court with the assistance of international experts in 2011.Following Allende's death, General Augusto Pinochet refused to return authority to a civilian government, and Chile was later ruled by a military junta that was in power up until 1990, ending more than four decades of uninterrupted democratic governance. The military junta that took over dissolved the Congress of Chile, suspended the Constitution, and began a persecution of alleged dissidents, in which at least 3,095 civilians disappeared or were killed.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.584","Same-sex marriage","","Same-sex marriage (also known as gay marriage) is the marriage of two people of the same sex or gender, entered into in a civil or religious ceremony. There are records of same-sex marriage dating back to the first century. In the modern era, same-sex marriage started being legalized at the beginning of the 21st century. Today, it is available in 28 countries.\nSame-sex marriage is legally performed and recognized (nationwide or in some jurisdictions) in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Ecuador, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Uruguay. Same-sex marriage is also due to become legal in Costa Rica. Israel recognizes same-sex marriages entered into abroad as full marriages. Furthermore, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights has issued a ruling that is expected to facilitate recognition in several countries in the Americas.The introduction of same-sex marriage (also called marriage equality) has varied by jurisdiction, and came about through legislative change to marriage law, court rulings based on constitutional guarantees of equality, recognition that it is allowed by existing marriage law, or by direct popular vote (via referendums and initiatives). The recognition of same-sex marriage is considered to be a human right and a civil right as well as a political, social, and religious issue. The most prominent supporters of same-sex marriage are human rights and civil rights organizations as well as the medical and scientific communities, while the most prominent opponents are religious fundamentalist groups. Polls consistently show continually rising support for the recognition of same-sex marriage in all developed democracies and in some developing democracies.\nScientific studies show that the financial, psychological, and physical well-being of gay people are enhanced by marriage, and that the children of same-sex parents benefit from being raised by married same-sex couples within a marital union that is recognized by law and supported by societal institutions. Social science research indicates that the exclusion of homosexuals from marriage stigmatizes and invites public discrimination against them, with research also repudiating the notion that either civilization or viable social orders depend upon restricting marriage to heterosexuals. Same-sex marriage can provide those in committed same-sex relationships with relevant government services and make financial demands on them comparable to that required of those in opposite-sex marriages, and also gives them legal protections such as inheritance and hospital visitation rights. Opposition to same-sex marriage is based on claims such as that homosexuality is unnatural and abnormal, that the recognition of same-sex unions will promote homosexuality in society, and that children are better off when raised by opposite-sex couples. These claims are refuted by scientific studies, which show that homosexuality is a natural and normal variation in human sexuality, and that sexual orientation is not a choice. Many studies have shown that children of same-sex couples fare just as well as the children of opposite-sex couples; some studies have shown benefits to being raised by same-sex couples.A study of nationwide data from across the United States from January 1999 to December 2015 revealed that the establishment of same-sex marriage is associated with a significant reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among children, with the effect being concentrated among children of a minority sexual orientation, resulting in about 134,000 fewer children attempting suicide each year in the United States.\n\n","wikipedia","5.5"

A lesser Sanhedrin of 23 judges was appointed to each city, but there was to be only one Great Sanhedrin of 71 judges, which among other roles acted as the Supreme Court, taking appeals from cases decided by lesser courts. In general usage, ""The Sanhedrin"" without qualifier normally refers to the Great Sanhedrin, which was composed of the Nasi, who functioned as head or representing president, and was a member of the court; the Av Beit Din or chief of the court, who was second to the nasi; and sixty-nine general members (Mufla).\nIn the Second Temple period, the Great Sanhedrin met in the Temple in Jerusalem, in a building called the Hall of Hewn Stones. The Great Sanhedrin convened every day except festivals and the sabbath day (Shabbat).\nAfter the destruction of the Second Temple and the failure of the Bar Kokhba Revolt, the Great Sanhedrin moved to Galilee, which became part of the Roman province of Syria Palaestina. In this period the Sanhedrin was sometimes referred as the Galilean Patriarchate or Patriarchate of Palaestina, being the governing legal body of Galilean Jewry. In the late 200s CE, to avoid persecution, the name ""Sanhedrin"" was dropped and its decisions were issued under the name of Beit HaMidrash (house of learning). The last universally binding decision of the Great Sanhedrin appeared in 358 CE, when the Hebrew Calendar was abandoned. The Great Sanhedrin was finally disbanded in 425 CE after continued persecution by the Eastern Roman Empire.\nOver the centuries, there have been attempts to revive the institution, such as the Grand Sanhedrin convened by Napoleon Bonaparte, and modern attempts in Israel.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.587","Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis","","The hypothesis of linguistic relativity, part of relativism, also known as the Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis , or Whorfianism is a principle claiming that the structure of a language affects its speakers' world view or cognition, and thus people's perceptions are relative to their spoken language. \nThe principle is often defined in one of two versions: the strong hypothesis, which was held by some of the early linguists before World War II, and the weak hypothesis, mostly held by some of the modern linguists.\nThe strong version says that language determines thought and that linguistic categories limit and determine cognitive categories.\nThe weak version says that linguistic categories and usage only influence thought and decisions.The principle had been accepted and then abandoned by linguists during the early 20th century following the changing perceptions of social acceptance for the other especially after World War II. The origin of formulated arguments against the acceptance of linguistic relativity are attributed to Noam Chomsky.","wikipedia","5.10"

"3.589","Satanism","","Satanism is a group of ideological and philosophical beliefs based on Satan. Contemporary religious practice of Satanism began with the founding of the Church of Satan in 1966, although a few historical precedents exist. Prior to the public practice, Satanism existed primarily as an accusation by various Christian groups toward perceived ideological opponents, rather than a self-identity. Satanism, and the concept of Satan, has also been used by artists and entertainers for symbolic expression.\nAccusations that various groups have been practicing Satanism have been made throughout much of Christian history. During the Middle Ages, the Inquisition attached to the Catholic Church alleged that various heretical Christian sects and groups, such as the Knights Templar and the Cathars, performed secret Satanic rituals. In the subsequent Early Modern period, belief in a widespread Satanic conspiracy of witches resulted in mass trials of alleged witches across Europe and the North American colonies. Accusations that Satanic conspiracies were active, and behind events such as Protestantism (and conversely, the Protestant claim that the Pope was the Antichrist) and the French Revolution continued to be made in Christendom during the eighteenth to the twentieth century. The idea of a vast Satanic conspiracy reached new heights with the influential Taxil hoax of France in the 1890s, which claimed that Freemasonry worshiped Satan, Lucifer, and Baphomet in their rituals. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Satanic ritual abuse hysteria spread through the United States and the United Kingdom, amid fears that groups of Satanists were regularly sexually abusing and murdering children in their rites. In most of these cases, there is no corroborating evidence that any of those accused of Satanism were actually practitioners of a Satanic religion or guilty of the allegations leveled at them.\nSince the 19th century, various small religious groups have emerged that identify as Satanists or use Satanic iconography. Satanist groups that appeared after the 1960s are widely diverse, but two major trends are theistic Satanism and atheistic Satanism. Theistic Satanists venerate Satan as a supernatural deity, viewing him not as omnipotent but rather as a patriarch. In contrast, atheistic Satanists regard Satan as merely a symbol of certain human traits.Contemporary religious Satanism is predominantly an American phenomenon, the ideas spreading elsewhere with the effects of globalization and the Internet. The Internet spreads awareness of other Satanists, and is also the main battleground for Satanist disputes. Satanism started to reach Central and Eastern Europe in the 1990s, in time with the fall of the Soviet Union, and most noticeably in Poland and Lithuania, predominantly Roman Catholic countries.\n\n","wikipedia","5.1"

"3.591","Saturday Night Live","","Saturday Night Live (known as SNL) is an American late-night live television sketch comedy and variety show created by Lorne Michaels and developed by Dick Ebersol. The show premiered on NBC on October 11, 1975, under the original title NBC's Saturday Night. The show's comedy sketches, which often parody contemporary culture and politics, are performed by a large and varying cast of repertory and newer cast members. Each episode is hosted by a celebrity guest, who usually delivers the opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast as with featured performances by a musical guest. An episode normally begins with a cold open sketch that ends with someone breaking character and proclaiming, ""Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!"", properly beginning the show.\nIn 1980, Michaels left the series to explore other opportunities. He was replaced by Jean Doumanian, who was replaced by Ebersol after a season of bad reviews. Ebersol ran the show until 1985. Since Michaels' return he has held the job of show-runner. Many SNL cast members have found national stardom while appearing on the show, and achieved success in film and television, both in front of and behind the camera. Others associated with the show, such as writers, have gone on to successful careers creating, writing, and starring in television and film.\nBroadcast from Studio 8H at NBC's headquarters in the Comcast Building at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, SNL has aired 885 episodes since its debut, and began its forty-fifth season on September 28, 2019, making it one of the longest-running network television programs in the United States. The show format has been developed and recreated in several countries, meeting with different levels of success. Successful sketches have seen life outside the show as feature films including The Blues Brothers (1980) and Wayne's World (1992). The show has been marketed in other ways, including home media releases of ""best of"" and whole seasons, and books and documentaries about behind-the-scenes activities of running and developing the show.\nThroughout four decades on air, Saturday Night Live has received a number of awards, including 71 Primetime Emmy Awards, four Writers Guild of America Awards, and two Peabody Awards. In 2000, it was inducted into the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame. It was ranked tenth in TV Guide's ""50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time"" list, and in 2007 it was listed as one of Time magazine's ""100 Best TV Shows of All-TIME."" As of 2018, the show had received 252 Primetime Emmy Award nominations, the most received by any television program. The live aspect of the show has resulted in several controversies and acts of censorship, with mistakes and intentional acts of sabotage by performers as well as guests.","wikipedia","5.13"
"3.592","Schizophrenia","","Schizophrenia is a mental illness characterized by relapsing episodes of psychosis. Major symptoms include hallucinations (often hearing voices), delusions (having beliefs not shared by others), and disorganized thinking. Other symptoms include social withdrawal, decreased emotional expression, and lack of motivation. Symptoms typically come on gradually, begin in young adulthood, and in many cases never resolve. There is no objective diagnostic test; diagnosis is based on observed behavior, a history that includes the person's reported experiences, and reports of others familiar with the person. To be diagnosed with schizophrenia, symptoms and functional impairment need to be present for six months. Many people with schizophrenia have other mental disorders that may include an anxiety disorder such as panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depressive disorder, or a substance use disorder.About 0.3% to 0.7% of people are affected by schizophrenia during their lifetimes. In 2017, there were an estimated 1.1 million new cases and a total of 19.8 million cases globally. Males are more often affected and onset is on average earlier in age. The causes of schizophrenia include environmental and genetic factors. Possible environmental factors include being raised in a city, cannabis use during adolescence, infections, the ages of a person's parents, and poor nutrition during pregnancy. Genetic factors include a variety of common and rare genetic variants.About half of those diagnosed with schizophrenia will have a significant improvement over the long term with no further relapses, and a small proportion of these will recover completely. The other half will have a lifelong impairment, and severe cases may be repeatedly admitted to hospital. Social problems such as long-term unemployment, poverty, homelessness, exploitation, and victimization are common consequences. Compared to the general population, people with schizophrenia have a higher suicide rate (about 5% overall) and more physical health problems, leading to an average decreased life expectancy of 20 years. In 2015, an estimated 17,000 people worldwide died from behavior related to, or caused by, schizophrenia.The mainstay of treatment is an antipsychotic medication, along with counselling, job training, and social rehabilitation. In those who do not improve with other antipsychotics, clozapine may be tried. In situations where there is a risk of harm to self or others, a short involuntary hospitalization may be necessary. Long-term hospitalization may be needed for a small number of people with severe schizophrenia. In countries where supportive services are limited or unavailable, long-term hospital stays are more typical.","wikipedia","5.8"

"3.594","Scientific method","","The scientific method is an empirical method of acquiring knowledge that has characterized the development of science since at least the 17th century. It involves careful observation, applying rigorous skepticism about what is observed, given that cognitive assumptions can distort how one interprets the observation. It involves formulating hypotheses, via induction, based on such observations; experimental and measurement-based testing of deductions drawn from the hypotheses; and refinement (or elimination) of the hypotheses based on the experimental findings. These are principles of the scientific method, as distinguished from a definitive series of steps applicable to all scientific enterprises.Though diverse models for the scientific method are available, there is in general a continuous process that includes observations about the natural world. People are naturally inquisitive, so they often come up with questions about things they see or hear, and they often develop ideas or hypotheses about why things are the way they are. The best hypotheses lead to predictions that can be tested in various ways. The most conclusive testing of hypotheses comes from reasoning based on carefully controlled experimental data. Depending on how well additional tests match the predictions, the original hypothesis may require refinement, alteration, expansion or even rejection. If a particular hypothesis becomes very well supported, a general theory may be developed.Although procedures vary from one field of inquiry to another, they are frequently the same from one to another. The process of the scientific method involves making conjectures (hypotheses), deriving predictions from them as logical consequences, and then carrying out experiments or empirical observations based on those predictions. A hypothesis is a conjecture, based on knowledge obtained while seeking answers to the question. The hypothesis might be very specific, or it might be broad. Scientists then test hypotheses by conducting experiments or studies. A scientific hypothesis must be falsifiable, implying that it is possible to identify a possible outcome of an experiment or observation that conflicts with predictions deduced from the hypothesis; otherwise, the hypothesis cannot be meaningfully tested.The purpose of an experiment is to determine whether observations agree with or conflict with the predictions derived from a hypothesis. Experiments can take place anywhere from a garage to CERN's Large Hadron Collider. There are difficulties in a formulaic statement of method, however. Though the scientific method is often presented as a fixed sequence of steps, it represents rather a set of general principles. Not all steps take place in every scientific inquiry (nor to the same degree), and they are not always in the same order.","wikipedia","5.2"

The foundation soon entered bankruptcy, and Hubbard lost the rights to his seminal publication Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health in 1952. He then recharacterized the subject as a religion and renamed it Scientology, retaining the terminology, doctrines, the E-meter, and the practice of auditing. Within a year, he regained the rights to Dianetics and retained both subjects under the umbrella of the Church of Scientology.The Church of Scientology says that a human is an immortal, spiritual being (thetan) that is resident in a physical body. The thetan has had innumerable past lives and it is observed in advanced Scientology texts that lives preceding the thetan's arrival on Earth were lived in extraterrestrial cultures. Based on case studies at advanced levels, it is predicted that any Scientologist undergoing auditing will eventually come across and recount a common series of events.\nHubbard describes the etymology of the word ""Scientology"" as coming from the Latin word scio, meaning know or distinguish, and the Greek word logos, meaning ""the word or outward form by which the inward thought is expressed and made known"". Hubbard writes, ""thus, Scientology means knowing about knowing, or the science of knowledge"".Hubbard's groups have encountered considerable opposition and controversy.  In January 1951, the New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners brought proceedings against Dianetics Foundation on the charge of teaching medicine without a license. During the 1970s Hubbard's followers engaged in a program of criminal infiltration of the U.S. government. Hubbard-inspired organizations and their classification are often a point of contention. Germany classifies Scientology groups as an ""anti-constitutional sect"", while in France they have been classified as a dangerous cult by parliamentary reports.","wikipedia","['5.6','5.1']"
"3.596","Sea level rise","","Since at least the start of the 20th century, the average global sea level has been rising. Between 1900 and 2016, the sea level rose by 16\u201321 cm (6.3\u20138.3 in). More precise data gathered from satellite radar measurements reveal an accelerating rise of 7.5 cm (3.0 in) from 1993 to 2017, which is a trend of roughly 30 cm (12 in) per century. This acceleration is due mostly to human-caused global warming, which is driving thermal expansion of seawater and the melting of land-based ice sheets and glaciers. Between 1993 and 2018, thermal expansion of the oceans contributed 42% to sea level rise; the melting of temperate glaciers, 21%; Greenland, 15%; and Antarctica, 8%. Climate scientists expect the rate to further accelerate during the 21st century.Projecting future sea level is challenging, due to the complexity of many aspects of the climate system. As climate research into past and present sea levels leads to improved computer models, projections have consistently increased.  For example, in 2007 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projected a high end estimate of 60 cm (2 ft) through 2099, but their 2014 report raised the high-end estimate to about 90 cm (3 ft). A number of later studies have concluded that a global sea level rise of 200 to 270 cm (6.6 to 8.9 ft) this century is ""physically plausible"". A conservative estimate of the long-term projections is that each Celsius degree of temperature rise triggers a sea level rise of approximately 2.3 meters (4.2 ft/degree Fahrenheit) over a period of two millennia (2,000 years): an example of climate inertia.The sea level will not rise uniformly everywhere on Earth, and it will even drop slightly in some locations, such as the Arctic. Local factors include tectonic effects and subsidence of the land, tides, currents and storms. Sea level rises can influence human populations considerably in coastal and island regions. Widespread coastal flooding is expected with several degrees of warming sustained for millennia. Further effects are higher storm-surges and more dangerous tsunamis, displacement of populations, loss and degradation of agricultural land and damage in cities. Natural environments like marine ecosystems are also affected, with fish, birds and plants losing parts of their habitat.Societies can respond to sea level rise in three different ways: to retreat, to accommodate and to protect. Sometimes these adaptation strategies go hand in hand, but at other times choices have to be made among different strategies. Ecosystems that adapt to rising sea levels by moving inland might not always be able to do so, due to natural or artificial barriers.\n\n","wikipedia","5.9"
"3.598","Seamus incident","","During a 1983 family vacation, Mitt Romney drove 12 hours with his dog on top of the car in a windshield-equipped carrier. This incident became the subject of negative media attention and political attacks on Romney in both the 2008 and the 2012 presidential elections.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.597","SeaWorld","","SeaWorld is a United States theme park chain headquartered out of Orlando, Florida. It is a proprietor of marine mammal parks, oceanariums, animal theme parks, and rehabilitation centers owned by SeaWorld Entertainment (one park will be owned and operated by Miral under a license). The parks feature orcas, sea lion, and dolphin shows and zoological displays featuring various other marine animals. There are operations located within the United States in Orlando, Florida; San Diego, California; San Antonio, Texas; later outside the United States such as Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; and previously Aurora, Ohio. On March 5, 2007, SeaWorld Orlando announced addition of the Aquatica water park to its adventure park, which already includes SeaWorld and Discovery Cove.\n\n \nSeaWorld parks also feature thrill rides, including roller coasters like Kraken, Mako and Manta at SeaWorld Orlando, and Steel Eel and The Great White at SeaWorld San Antonio. Journey to Atlantis, a combination roller coaster and splashdown ride, can be found at all three parks. The parks were owned by Busch Entertainment Corp., the family entertainment division of Anheuser-Busch, which is best known for brewing beer. In 2009, Busch Entertainment was sold to the Blackstone Group and subsequently renamed SeaWorld Entertainment. In 2013, Blackstone sold 37% of SeaWorld Entertainment in an initial public offering and sold its remaining 21% holding to Zhonghong Zhuoye in 2017.The parks' marine mammal collections have been the subject of public debate over the years. The 2013 documentary film Blackfish, produced after a SeaWorld Orlando trainer was killed by one of the park's orcas, led to initial decreases in attendance, profits and the company's share price. In 2018, SeaWorld's attendance and revenue began to recover with the addition of new rides, shows, and animal exhibits at its parks, as well as increased marketing about the parks' conservation and rescue efforts. It is a major theme park competitor to Six Flags, Cedar Fair, Walt Disney Parks & Resorts and Universal Parks & Resorts.\nIn 2016, SeaWorld announced that they would end their in-park Orca breeding program and eventually phase out their theatrical Orca whale shows altogether (due to state legislation in California that banned shows using orcas) starting in San Diego. It was announced later in the same year, that SeaWorld would build their first park without killer whales and outside of the United States in Abu Dhabi, UAE.","wikipedia","5.12"
"3.599","Sedition","","Sedition is overt conduct, such as speech and organization, that tends toward insurrection against the established order. Sedition often includes subversion of a constitution and incitement of discontent towards, or resistance against established authority. Sedition may include any commotion, though not aimed at direct and open violence against the laws. Seditious words in writing are seditious libel. A seditionist is one who engages in or promotes the interest of sedition.\nTypically, sedition is not considered a subversive act, and the overt acts that may be prosecutable under sedition laws vary from one legal code to another. Where the history of these legal codes has been traced, there is also a record of the change in the definition of the elements constituting sedition at certain points in history. This overview has served to develop a sociological definition of sedition as well, within the study of state persecution.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.600","Selective Service","","The Selective Service System (SSS) is an independent agency of the United States government that maintains information on those potentially subject to military conscription (i.e. the draft). All male U.S. citizens (and male immigrant non-citizens) who are between the ages of 18 and 26 are required by law to have registered within 30 days of their 18th birthdays, and must notify the Selective Service within ten days of any changes to any of the information they provided on their registration cards, such as a change of address. The Selective Service System is a contingency mechanism for the possibility that conscription becomes necessary.\nRegistration with Selective Service is required for various federal programs and benefits, including the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), student loans and Pell Grants, job training, federal employment, and naturalization.The Selective Service System provides the names of all registrants to the Joint Advertising Marketing Research & Studies (JAMRS) program for inclusion in the JAMRS Consolidated Recruitment Database. The names are distributed to the Services for recruiting purposes on a quarterly basis.Regulations are codified at Title 32 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter XVI.","wikipedia","5.0"
"3.601","Self-harm","","Self-harm, also known as self-injury, is defined as the intentional, direct injuring of body tissue, done without the intent to commit suicide. Other terms such as cutting and self-mutilation have been used for any self-harming behavior regardless of suicidal intent. The most common form of self-harm is using a sharp object to cut one's skin. Other forms include behaviour such as burning, scratching, or hitting body parts. While older definitions included behaviour such as interfering with wound healing, excessive skin picking (dermatillomania), hair pulling (trichotillomania) and the ingestion of toxic substances or objects as self-harm, in current terminology those are differentiated from the term self-harm.\nBehaviours associated with substance abuse and eating disorders are not considered self-harm because the resulting tissue damage is ordinarily an unintentional side effect. Although suicide is not the intention of self-harm, the relationship between self-harm and suicide is complex, as self-harming behaviour may be potentially life-threatening. There is also an increased risk of suicide in individuals who self-harm and self-harm is found in 40\u201360% of suicides. However, generalizing individuals who self-harm to be suicidal is, in the majority of cases, inaccurate.The desire to self-harm is a common symptom of some personality disorders. People with other mental disorders may also self-harm, including those with depression, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, eating disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, and  dissociative disorders. Studies also provide strong support for a self-punishment function, and modest evidence for anti-dissociation, interpersonal-influence, anti-suicide, sensation-seeking, and interpersonal boundaries functions. Self-harm can also occur in high-functioning individuals who have no underlying mental health diagnosis. The motivations for self-harm vary. Some use it as a coping mechanism to provide temporary relief of intense feelings such as anxiety, depression, stress, emotional numbness, or a sense of failure. Self-harm is often associated with a history of trauma, including emotional and sexual abuse. There are a number of different methods that can be used to treat self-harm and which concentrate on either treating the underlying causes or on treating the behaviour itself. When self-harm is associated with depression, antidepressant drugs and therapy may be effective. Other approaches involve avoidance techniques, which focus on keeping the individual occupied with other activities, or replacing the act of self-harm with safer methods that do not lead to permanent damage.Self-harm is most common between the ages of 12 and 24. Self-harm is more common in females than males with this risk being five times greater in the 12\u201315 age group. Self-harm in childhood is relatively rare but the rate has been increasing since the 1980s. Self-harm can also occur in the elderly population. The risk of serious injury and suicide is higher in older people who self-harm. Captive animals, such as birds and monkeys, are also known to participate in self-harming behaviour.\n\n","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.602","Semen","","Semen, also known as seminal fluid, is an organic fluid that may contain spermatozoa. It is secreted by the gonads (sexual glands) and other sexual organs of male or hermaphroditic animals and can fertilize female ova. In humans, seminal fluid contains several components besides spermatozoa: proteolytic and other enzymes as well as fructose are elements of seminal fluid which promote the survival of spermatozoa, and provide a medium through which they can move or ""swim"". Semen is produced and originates from the seminal vesicle, which is located in the pelvis. The process that results in the discharge of semen is called ejaculation. Semen is also a form of genetic material. In animals, semen has been collected for cryoconservation. Cryoconservation of animal genetic resources is a practice that calls for the collection of genetic material in efforts for conservation of a particular breed.","wikipedia","5.7"
"3.603","Separation of church and state","","The separation of church and state is a philosophic and jurisprudential concept for defining political distance in the relationship between religious organizations and the nation state. Conceptually, the term refers to the creation of a secular state (with or without legally explicit church\u2013state separation) and to disestablishment, the changing of an existing, formal relationship between the church and the state.In a society, the degree of political separation between the church and the civil state is determined by the legal structures and prevalent legal views that define the proper relationship between organized religion and the state. The arm's length principle proposes a relationship wherein the two political entities interact as organizations each independent of the authority of the other. The strict application of the secular principle of la\u00efcit\u00e9 (secularity) is used in France, while secular societies, such as Denmark and the United Kingdom, maintain a form of constitutional recognition of an official state religion.The philosophy of the separation of the church from the civil state parallels the philosophies of secularism, disestablishmentarianism, religious liberty, and religious pluralism, by way of which the European states assumed some of the social roles of the church, the welfare state, a social shift that produced a culturally secular population and public sphere. In practice, church\u2013state separation varies from total separation, mandated by the country's political constitution, as in India and Singapore, to a state religion, as in the Maldives.","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.604","Separatism","","A common definition of separatism is that it is the advocacy of a state of cultural, ethnic, tribal, religious, racial, governmental or gender separation from the larger group. While it often refers to full political secession, separatist groups may seek nothing more than greater autonomy. While some critics may equate separatism with religious segregation, racist segregation, or sexist segregation, most separatists argue that separation by choice  may serve useful purposes and is not the same as government-enforced segregation. There is some academic debate about this definition, and in particular how it relates to secessionism, as has been discussed online.Separatist groups practice a form of identity politics, or political activity and theorizing founded in the shared experiences of injustice visited upon members of certain social groups. Such groups believe attempts at integration with dominant groups compromise their identity and ability to pursue greater self-determination. However, economic and political factors usually are critical in creating strong separatist movements as opposed to less ambitious identity movements.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.605","September 11 attacks","","The September 11 attacks (also referred to as 9/11) were a series of four coordinated terrorist attacks by the Islamic terrorist group al-Qaeda against the United States on the morning of Tuesday, September 11, 2001. The attacks resulted in 2,977 victim fatalities, over 25,000 injuries, and caused at least $10 billion in infrastructure and property damage. Additional people have died of 9/11-related cancer and respiratory diseases in the months and years following the attacks.\nFour passenger airliners operated by two major U.S. passenger air carriers (United Airlines and American Airlines)\u2014all of which departed from airports in the northeastern United States bound for San Francisco and Los Angeles\u2014were hijacked by 19 al-Qaeda terrorists. Two of the planes, American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175, were crashed into the North and South towers, respectively, of the World Trade Center complex in Lower Manhattan. Within an hour and 42 minutes, both 110-story towers collapsed. Debris and the resulting fires caused a partial or complete collapse of all other buildings in the World Trade Center complex, including the 47-story 7 World Trade Center tower, as well as significant damage to ten other large surrounding structures. A third plane, American Airlines Flight 77, was crashed into the Pentagon (the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Defense) in Arlington County, Virginia, which led to a partial collapse of the building's west side. The fourth plane, United Airlines Flight 93, was initially flown toward Washington, D.C., but crashed into a field in Stonycreek Township near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, after its passengers thwarted the hijackers. 9/11 is the single deadliest terrorist attack in human history and the single deadliest incident for firefighters and law enforcement officers in the history of the United States, with 343 and 72 killed, respectively.Suspicion quickly fell on al-Qaeda. The United States responded by launching the War on Terror and invading Afghanistan to depose the Taliban, which had failed to comply with U.S. demands to extradite Osama bin Laden and expel al-Qaeda from Afghanistan. Many countries strengthened their anti-terrorism legislation and expanded the powers of law enforcement and intelligence agencies to prevent terrorist attacks. Although Osama bin Laden, al-Qaeda's leader, initially denied any involvement, in 2004 he claimed responsibility for the attacks. Al-Qaeda and bin Laden cited U.S. support of Israel, the presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, and sanctions against Iraq as motives. After evading capture for almost a decade, bin Laden was located in Pakistan and killed by SEAL Team Six of the U.S. Navy in May 2011, during the Obama administration.\nThe destruction of the World Trade Center and nearby infrastructure seriously harmed the economy of New York City and had a significant effect on global markets, which resulted in the closing of Wall Street until September 17 and the civilian airspace in the U.S. and Canada until September 13. Many closings, evacuations, and cancellations followed, out of respect or fear of further attacks. Cleanup of the World Trade Center site was completed in May 2002, and the Pentagon was repaired within a year. On November 18, 2006, construction of One World Trade Center began at the World Trade Center site. The building opened on November 3, 2014.

"3.607","Seventh-day Adventist Church","","The Seventh-day Adventist Church is a Protestant Christian denomination which is distinguished by its observance of Saturday, the seventh day of the week in Christian and Jewish calendars, as the Sabbath, and its emphasis on the imminent Second Coming (advent) of Jesus Christ. The denomination grew out of the Millerite movement in the United States during the mid-19th century and it was formally established in 1863. Among its founders was Ellen G. White, whose extensive writings are still held in high regard by the church.Much of the theology of the Seventh-day Adventist Church corresponds to common Protestant Christian teachings, such as the Trinity and the infallibility of Scripture. Distinctive teachings include the unconscious state of the dead and the doctrine of an investigative judgment. The church is known for its emphasis on diet and health, its ""holistic"" understanding of the person, its promotion of religious liberty, and its conservative principles and lifestyle.The world church is governed by a General Conference, with smaller regions administered by divisions, union conferences, and local conferences. It currently has a worldwide baptized membership of over 20 million people, and 25 million adherents.  As of May 2007, it was the twelfth-largest religious body in the world, and the sixth-largest highly international religious body. It is ethnically and culturally diverse, and maintains a missionary presence in over 215 countries and territories. The church operates over 7,500 schools including over 100 post-secondary institutions, numerous hospitals, and publishing houses worldwide, as well as a humanitarian aid organization known as the Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA).","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.608","Sex differences in intelligence","","Differences in human intelligence have long been a topic of debate among researchers and scholars. With the advent of the concept of g or general intelligence, many researchers have argued for no significant sex differences in g factor or general intelligence, while others have argued for slightly greater intelligence for males, and others for a female advantage.  These results depend on the methodology, tests researchers used for their claims, and the personal performances of the participants.Some research indicates male advantages on some cognitive tests are minimized when controlling for socioeconomic factors. Other research has concluded that there is larger variability in male scores compared to female scores, which results in more males than females in the top and bottom of the IQ distribution. Additionally, there are differences in the capacity of males and females in performing certain tasks, such as rotation of objects in space, often categorized as spatial ability.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.609","Sex differences in psychology","","Sex differences in psychology are differences in the mental functions and behaviors of the sexes, and are due to a complex interplay of biological, developmental, and cultural factors. Differences have been found in a variety of fields such as mental health, cognitive abilities, personality, emotion, sexuality, and tendency towards aggression. Such variation may be innate or learned and is often very difficult to distinguish. Modern research attempts to distinguish between these causes, and to analyze any ethical concerns raised. Since behavior is a result of interactions between nature and nurture researchers are interested in investigating how biology and environment interact to produce such differences, although this is often not possible.A number of factors combine to influence the development of sex differences, including genetics and epigenetics; differences in brain structure and function; hormones, and socialization.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.610","Sex offender","","A sex offender (sexual offender, sex abuser, or sexual abuser) is a person who has committed a sex crime.  What constitutes a sex crime differs by culture and legal jurisdiction. The majority of convicted sex offenders have convictions for crimes of a sexual nature; however, some sex offenders have simply violated a law contained in a sexual category.  Some of the crimes which usually result in a mandatory sex-offender classification are: a second prostitution conviction, sending or receiving obscene content in the form of SMS text messages (sexting), and relationship between young adults and teenagers resulting in corruption of a minor (if the age between them is greater than 1,060 days).  If any sexual contact was made by the adult to the minor, then child molestation has occurred.  Other serious offenses are sexual assault, statutory rape, bestiality, child sexual abuse, incest, rape, and sexual imposition.\nSex offender registration laws in the United States may also classify less serious offenses as sexual offenses requiring sex offender registration. In some states public urination, having sex on a beach, or unlawful imprisonment of a minor also constitute sexual offenses requiring registration.\n\n","wikipedia","5.7"
"3.611","Sexual abuse","","Sexual abuse, also referred to as molestation, is abusive sexual behavior by one person upon another. It is often perpetrated using force or by taking advantage of another. When force is immediate, of short duration, or infrequent, it is called sexual assault. The offender is referred to as a sexual abuser or (often pejoratively) molester. The term also covers any behavior by an adult or older adolescent towards a child to stimulate any of the involved sexually. The use of a child, or other individuals younger than the age of consent, for sexual stimulation is referred to as child sexual abuse or statutory rape.","wikipedia","5.7"
"3.612","Sexual harassment","","Sexual harassment is a type of harassment technique that relates to a sexual nature and the unwelcome or inappropriate promise of rewards in exchange for sexual favors. Sexual harassment includes a range of actions from mild transgressions to sexual abuse or assault. Harassment can occur in many different social settings such as the workplace, the home, school, churches, etc. Harassers or victims may be of any gender.In most modern legal contexts, sexual harassment is illegal. Laws surrounding sexual harassment generally do not prohibit simple teasing, offhand comments, or minor isolated incidents\u2014that is due to the fact that they do not impose a ""general civility code"". In the workplace, harassment may be considered illegal when it is frequent or severe thereby creating a hostile or offensive work environment or when it results in an adverse employment decision (such as the victim's demotion, firing or quitting). The legal and social understanding of sexual harassment, however, varies by culture.\nSexual harassment by an employer is a form of illegal employment discrimination. For many businesses or organizations, preventing sexual harassment and defending employees from sexual harassment charges have become key goals of legal decision-making.","wikipedia","5.5"

"3.614","Sexually transmitted disease","","Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), also referred to as sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), are infections that are commonly spread by sexual activity, especially vaginal intercourse, anal sex and oral sex. Many times STIs initially do not cause symptoms. This results in a greater risk of passing the disease on to others. Symptoms and signs of disease may include vaginal discharge, penile discharge, ulcers on or around the genitals, and pelvic pain. STIs can be transmitted to an infant before or during childbirth and may result in poor outcomes for the baby. Some STIs may cause problems with the ability to get pregnant.More than 30 different bacteria, viruses, and parasites can be transmitted through sexual activity. Bacterial STIs include chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. Viral STIs include genital herpes, HIV/AIDS, and genital warts. Parasitic STIs include trichomoniasis. While usually spread by sex, some STIs can be spread by non-sexual contact with donor tissue, blood, breastfeeding, or during childbirth. STI diagnostic tests are usually easily available in the developed world, but this is often not the case in the developing world.The most effective way of preventing STIs is by not having sex. Some vaccinations may also decrease the risk of certain infections including hepatitis B and some types of HPV. Safer sex practices such as use of condoms, having a smaller number of sexual partners, and being in a relationship where each person only has sex with the other also decreases the risk. Circumcision in adult males may be effective to prevent some infections. During school, comprehensive sex education may also be useful. Most STIs are treatable or curable. Of the most common infections, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis are curable, while herpes, hepatitis B, HIV/AIDS, and HPV are treatable but not curable. Resistance to certain antibiotics is developing among some organisms such as gonorrhea.In 2015, about 1.1 billion people had STIs other than HIV/AIDS. About 500 million were infected with either syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia or trichomoniasis. At least an additional 530 million people have genital herpes and 290 million women have human papillomavirus. STIs other than HIV resulted in 108,000 deaths in 2015. In the United States there were 19 million new cases of sexually transmitted infections in 2010. Historical documentation of STIs date back to at least the Ebers papyrus around 1550 BC and the Old Testament. There is often shame and stigma associated with these infections. The term sexually transmitted infection is generally preferred over sexually transmitted disease or venereal disease, as it includes those who do not have symptomatic disease.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.615","Sharia","","Sharia (, Arabic: \u0634\u0631\u064a\u0639\u0629\u200e [\u0283a\u02c8ri\u02d0\u0295ah]), Islamic law  or sharia law is a religious law forming part of the Islamic tradition. It is derived from the religious precepts of Islam, particularly the Quran and the hadith. In Arabic, the term shar\u012b\u02bfah refers to God's immutable divine law and is contrasted with fiqh, which refers to its human scholarly interpretations. The manner of its application in modern times has been a subject of dispute between Muslim fundamentalists and modernists.Traditional theory of Islamic jurisprudence recognizes four sources of sharia: the Quran, sunnah (authentic hadith), qiyas (analogical reasoning), and ijma (juridical consensus). Different legal schools\u2014of which the most prominent are Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, Hanbali and Jafari\u2014developed methodologies for deriving sharia rulings from scriptural sources using a process known as ijtihad. Traditional jurisprudence (fiqh) distinguishes two principal branches of law, \u02bfib\u0101d\u0101t (rituals) and mu\u02bf\u0101mal\u0101t (social relations), which together comprise a wide range of topics. Its rulings are concerned with ethical standards as much as with legal norms, assigning actions to one of five categories: mandatory, recommended, neutral, abhorred, and prohibited. Thus, some areas of sharia overlap with the Western notion of law while others correspond more broadly to living life in accordance with God\u2019s will.Classical jurisprudence was elaborated by private religious scholars, largely through legal opinions (fatwas) issued by qualified jurists (muftis). It was historically applied in sharia courts by ruler-appointed judges, who dealt mainly with civil disputes and community affairs. Sultanic courts, the police and market inspectors administered criminal justice, which was influenced by sharia but not bound by its rules. Non-Muslim (dhimmi) communities had legal autonomy to adjudicate their internal affairs. Over the centuries, Sunni muftis were gradually incorporated into state bureaucracies, and fiqh was complemented by various economic, criminal and administrative laws issued by Muslim rulers. The Ottoman civil code of 1869\u20131876 was the first partial attempt to codify sharia.In the modern era, traditional laws in the Muslim world have been widely replaced by statutes inspired by European models. Judicial procedures and legal education were likewise brought in line with European practice. While the constitutions of most Muslim-majority states contain references to sharia, its classical rules were largely retained only in personal status (family) laws. Legislators who codified these laws sought to modernize them without abandoning their foundations in traditional jurisprudence. The Islamic revival of the late 20th century brought along calls by Islamist movements for full implementation of sharia, including hudud corporal punishments, such as stoning. In some cases, this resulted in traditionalist legal reform, while other countries witnessed juridical reinterpretation of sharia advocated by progressive reformers. Some Muslim-minority countries recognize the use of sharia-based family laws for their Muslim populations. Sharia also continues to influence other aspects of private and public life.\nThe role of sharia has become a contested topic around the world. Introduction of sharia-based laws sparked intercommunal violence in Nigeria and may have contributed to the breakup of Sudan. Some jurisdictions in North America have passed bans on use of sharia, framed as restrictions on religious or foreign laws. There are ongoing debates as to whether sharia is compatible with democracy, human rights, freedom of thought, women's rights, LGBT rights, and banking.","wikipedia","5.1"

"3.617","Sigmund Freud","","Sigmund Freud ( FROYD; German: [\u02c8zi\u02d0km\u028ant \u02c8f\u0281\u0254\u028ft]; born Sigismund Schlomo Freud; 6 May 1856 \u2013 23 September 1939) was an Austrian neurologist and the founder of psychoanalysis, a clinical method for treating psychopathology through dialogue between a patient and a psychoanalyst.Freud was born to Galician Jewish parents in the Moravian town of Freiberg, in the Austrian Empire. He qualified as a doctor of medicine in 1881 at the University of Vienna. Upon completing his habilitation in 1885, he was appointed a docent in neuropathology and became an affiliated professor in 1902. Freud lived and worked in Vienna, having set up his clinical practice there in 1886. In 1938, Freud left Austria to escape the Nazis. He died in exile in the United Kingdom in 1939.\nIn founding psychoanalysis, Freud developed therapeutic techniques such as the use of free association and discovered transference, establishing its central role in the analytic process. Freud's redefinition of sexuality to include its infantile forms led him to formulate the Oedipus complex as the central tenet of psychoanalytical theory. His analysis of dreams as wish-fulfillments provided him with models for the clinical analysis of symptom formation and the underlying mechanisms of repression. On this basis Freud elaborated his theory of the unconscious and went on to develop a model of psychic structure comprising id, ego and super-ego. Freud postulated the existence of libido, a sexualised energy with which mental processes and structures are invested and which generates erotic attachments, and a death drive, the source of compulsive repetition, hate, aggression and neurotic guilt. In his later works, Freud developed a wide-ranging interpretation and critique of religion and culture.\nThough in overall decline as a diagnostic and clinical practice, psychoanalysis remains influential within psychology, psychiatry, and psychotherapy, and across the humanities. It thus continues to generate extensive and highly contested debate with regard to its therapeutic efficacy, its scientific status, and whether it advances or is detrimental to the feminist cause. Nonetheless, Freud's work has suffused contemporary Western thought and popular culture. W. H. Auden's 1940 poetic tribute to Freud describes him as having created ""a whole climate of opinion / under whom we conduct our different lives.""","wikipedia","5.3"
"3.618","Silesia","","Silesia (, also UK: , US: ; Polish: \u015al\u0105sk [\u0255l\u0254\u0303sk] (listen); Czech: Slezsko [\u02c8sl\u025bsko]; German: Schlesien [\u02c8\u0283le\u02d0zi\u032f\u0259n] (listen); Lower Silesian: Schl\u00e4sing; Silesian: \u015al\u014dnsk [\u0255lonsk]; Lower Sorbian: \u0160lazy\u0144ska; Upper Sorbian: \u0160leska; Latin: Silesia) is a historical region of Central Europe located mostly in modern Poland, with small parts in the Czech Republic and Germany. Its area is about 40,000 km2 (15,400 sq mi), and its population about 8,000,000. Silesia is located along the Oder River. It consists of Lower Silesia and Upper Silesia.\nThe region is rich in mineral and natural resources, and includes several important industrial areas. Silesia's largest city and historical capital is Wroc\u0142aw. The biggest metropolitan area is the Upper Silesian metropolitan area, the centre of which is Katowice. Parts of the Czech city of Ostrava fall within the borders of Silesia.\nSilesia's borders and national affiliation have changed over time, both when it was a hereditary possession of noble houses and after the rise of modern nation-states. The first known states to hold power there were probably those of Greater Moravia at the end of the 9th century and Bohemia early in the 10th century. In the 10th century, Silesia was incorporated into the early Polish state, and after its division in the 12th century became a Piast duchy. In the 14th century, it became a constituent part of the Bohemian Crown Lands under the Holy Roman Empire, which passed to the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy in 1526.\nMost of Silesia was conquered by Prussia in 1742 and transferred from Austria to Prussia in the Treaty of Berlin. Later, Silesia became, as a province of Prussia, a part of the German Empire and the subsequent Weimar Republic. The varied history with changing aristocratic possessions resulted in an abundance of castles in Silesia, especially in the Jelenia G\u00f3ra valley. After World War I, the easternmost part of this region, i.e. an eastern strip of Upper Silesia, was awarded to Poland by the Entente Powers after insurrections by Poles and the Upper Silesian plebiscite. The remaining former Austrian parts of Silesia were partitioned to Czechoslovakia, forming part of Czechoslovakia's Sudetenland region, and are today part of the Czech Republic. In 1945, after World War II, the bulk of Silesia was transferred, on demand of the Polish delegation, to Polish jurisdiction by the Potsdam Agreement between the victorious Allies and became part of Poland, whose Communist government expelled the majority of Silesia's previous population. The small Lusatian strip west of the Oder\u2013Neisse line, which had belonged to Silesia since 1815, remained in Germany. The largest town and cultural centre of this region is G\u00f6rlitz.\nAs the result of the forced population shifts of 1945-48, today's inhabitants of Silesia speak the national languages of their respective countries. Previously German-speaking Lower Silesia has developed a new mixed Polish dialect. An ongoing debate exists whether Silesian speech should be considered a dialect of Polish or a separate language. A Lower Silesian German dialect remains, although today it is almost extinct due to their speakers' expulsion.","wikipedia","['5.5','5.6']"

"3.621","Slavery","","Slavery is any system in which principles of property law are applied to people, allowing individuals to own, buy and sell other individuals, as a de jure form of property. A slave is unable to withdraw unilaterally from such an arrangement and works without remuneration. Many scholars now use the term chattel slavery to refer to this specific sense of legalized, de jure slavery. In a broader sense, however, the word slavery may also refer to any situation in which an individual is de facto forced to work against their own will. Scholars also use the more generic terms such as unfree labour or forced labour to refer to such situations.  However, and especially under slavery in broader senses of the word, slaves may have some rights and protections according to laws or customs.\nSlavery existed in many cultures, dating back to early human civilizations. A person could become enslaved from the time of their birth, capture, or purchase. Slavery was legal in most societies at some time in the past but is now outlawed in all recognized countries. The last country to officially abolish slavery was Mauritania in 1981. Nevertheless, there are an estimated 40.3 million people worldwide subject to some form of modern slavery. The most common form of modern slave trade is commonly referred to as human trafficking. In other areas, slavery continues through practices such as debt bondage, the most widespread form of slavery today; serfdom; domestic servants kept in captivity; certain adoptions in which children are forced to work as slaves; child soldiers; and forced marriage.\n\n","wikipedia","5.6"

"3.623","Smoking","","Smoking is a practice in which a substance is burned and the resulting smoke breathed in to be tasted and absorbed into the bloodstream. Most commonly, the substance used is the dried leaves of the tobacco plant, which have been rolled into a small square of rice paper to create a small, round cylinder called a ""cigarette"". Smoking is primarily practiced as a route of administration for recreational drug use because the combustion of the dried plant leaves vaporizes and delivers active substances into the lungs where they are rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream and reach bodily tissue. In the case of cigarette smoking these substances are contained in a mixture of aerosol particles and gases and include the pharmacologically active alkaloid  nicotine; the vaporization creates heated aerosol and gas into a form that allows inhalation and deep penetration into the lungs where absorption into the bloodstream of the active substances occurs. In some cultures, smoking is also carried out as a part of various rituals, where participants use it to help induce trance-like states that, they believe, can lead them to spiritual enlightenment.\nSmoking generally has negative health effects, because smoke inhalation inherently poses challenges to various physiologic processes such as respiration. Diseases related to tobacco smoking have been shown to kill approximately half of long-term smokers when compared to average mortality rates faced by non-smokers. Smoking caused over five million deaths a year from 1990 to 2015.Smoking is one of the most common forms of recreational drug use. Tobacco smoking is the most popular form, being practiced by over one billion people globally, of whom the majority are in the developing countries. Less common drugs for smoking include cannabis and opium. Some of the substances are classified as hard narcotics, like heroin, but the use of these is very limited as they are usually not commercially available. Cigarettes are primarily industrially manufactured but also can be hand-rolled from loose tobacco and rolling paper. Other smoking implements include pipes, cigars, bidis, hookahs, and bongs.\nSmoking can be dated to as early as 5000 BCE, and has been recorded in many different cultures across the world. Early smoking evolved in association with religious ceremonies; as offerings to deities, in cleansing rituals or to allow shamans and priests to alter their minds for purposes of divination or spiritual enlightenment. After the European exploration and conquest of the Americas, the practice of smoking tobacco quickly spread to the rest of the world. In regions like India and Sub-Saharan Africa, it merged with existing practices of smoking (mostly of cannabis). In Europe, it introduced a new type of social activity and a form of drug intake which previously had been unknown.\nPerception surrounding smoking has varied over time and from one place to another: holy and sinful, sophisticated and vulgar, a panacea and deadly health hazard. In the 20th century, smoking came to be viewed in a decidedly negative light, especially in Western countries. This is due to smoking tobacco being among the leading causes of many diseases such as lung cancer, heart attack, COPD, erectile dysfunction, and birth defects. The health hazards of smoking have caused many countries to institute high taxes on tobacco products, run ads to discourage use, limit ads that promote use, and provide help with quitting for those who do smoke.","wikipedia","5.8"

"3.626","Social Credit System","","The Social Credit System (Chinese: \u793e\u4f1a\u4fe1\u7528\u4f53\u7cfb; pinyin: sh\u00e8hu\u00ec x\u00ecny\u00f2ng t\u01d0x\u00ec) is a national reputation system being developed by the Chinese government. The program initiated regional trials in 2009, before launching a national pilot with eight credit scoring firms in 2014. In 2018, these efforts were centralized under the People's Bank of China with participation from the eight firms. By 2020, it is intended to standardize the assessment of citizens' and businesses' economic and social reputation, or 'Social Credit'.The social credit initiative calls for the establishments of unified record system for individuals, businesses and the government to be tracked and evaluated for trustworthiness. Initial reports suggest the system utilizes numerical score as the reward and punishment mechanism; recently conducted reports suggest the numerical system has been implemented only in several regional pilot programs, while the nationwide regulatory method has been based primarily on blacklisting and whitelisting. The credit system is closely related to China's mass surveillance systems such as the Skynet, which incorporates facial recognition system and big data analysis technology.By 2018, some restrictions had been placed on citizens which state-owned media described as the first step toward creating a nationwide social credit system. As of November 2019, in addition to dishonest and fraudulent financial behavior, other behavior that some cities have officially listed as negative factors of credit ratings includes playing loud music or eating in rapid transits, violating traffic rules such as jaywalking and red-light violations, making reservations at restaurants or hotels but not showing up, failing to correctly sort personal waste, fraudulently using other people's public transportation ID cards, etc; on the other hand, behavior listed as positive factors of credit ratings includes donating blood, donating to charity, volunteering for community services, and so on.As of June 2019, according to the National Development and Reform Commission of China, 26.82 million air tickets as well as 5.96 million high-speed rail tickets have been denied to people who were deemed ""untrustworthy (\u5931\u4fe1)"" (on a blacklist), and 4.37 million ""untrustworthy"" people have chosen to fulfill their duties required by the law. In general, it takes 2\u20135 years to be removed from the blacklist, but early removal is also possible if the blacklisted person has done enough remedies. Certain personal information of the blacklisted people is deliberately made accessible to the society and is displayed online as well as at various public venues such as movie theaters and buses, while some cities have also banned children of ""untrustworthy"" residents from attending private schools and even universities. On the other hand, people with high credit ratings may receive rewards such as less waiting time at hospitals and governmental agencies, discounts at hotels, greater likelihood of receiving employment offers and so on.Supporters of the Credit System claim that the system helps to regulate social behavior, improve the ""trustworthiness"" which includes paying taxes and bills on time and promote traditional moral values, while critics of the system claim that it oversteps the rule of law and infringes the legal rights of residents and organizations, especially the right to reputation, the right to privacy as well as personal dignity, and that the system may be a tool for comprehensive government surveillance and for suppression of dissent from the Communist Party of China.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.627","Socialism","","Socialism is a political, social and economic philosophy encompassing a range of economic and social systems characterised by social ownership of the means of production and workers' self-management of enterprises. It includes the political theories and movements associated with such systems. Social ownership can be public, collective, cooperative or of equity. While no single definition encapsulates many types of socialism, social ownership is the one common element. It aims to circumvent the inefficiencies and crises traditionally associated with capital accumulation and the profit system in capitalism.Socialist systems are divided into non-market and market forms. Non-market socialism involves replacing factor markets and money with engineering and technical criteria based on calculation performed in-kind, thereby producing an economic mechanism that functions according to different economic laws from those of capitalism. The socialist calculation debate, originated by the economic calculation problem, concerns the feasibility and methods of resource allocation for a planned socialist system. By contrast, market socialism retains the use of monetary prices, factor markets and in some cases the profit motive, with respect to the operation of socially owned enterprises and the allocation of capital goods between them. Profits generated by these firms would be controlled directly by the workforce of each firm or accrue to society at large in the form of a social dividend.Socialist politics has been both internationalist and nationalist in orientation; organised through political parties and opposed to party politics; at times overlapping with trade unions and at other times independent and critical of them; and present in both industrialised and developing nations. Social democracy originated within the socialist movement, supporting economic and social interventions to promote social justice. While retaining socialism as a long-term goal, since the post-war period it has come to embrace a Keynesian mixed economy within a predominantly developed capitalist market economy and liberal democratic polity that expands state intervention to include income redistribution, regulation and a welfare state. Economic democracy proposes a sort of market socialism, with more democratic control of companies, currencies, investments and natural resources.The socialist political movement includes a set of political philosophies that originated in the revolutionary movements of the mid-to-late 18th century and out of concern for the social problems that were associated with capitalism. By the late 19th century, after the work of Karl Marx and his collaborator Friedrich Engels, socialism had come to signify opposition to capitalism and advocacy for a post-capitalist system based on some form of social ownership of the means of production. By the 1920s, communism and social democracy had become the two dominant political tendencies within the international socialist movement, with socialism itself becoming ""the most influential secular movement of the twentieth century"". While the emergence of the Soviet Union as the world's first nominally socialist state led to socialism's widespread association with the Soviet economic model, some economists and intellectuals argued that in practice the model functioned as a form of state capitalism or a non-planned administrative or command economy. Socialist parties and ideas remain a political force with varying degrees of power and influence on all continents, heading national governments in many countries around the world. Today, many socialists have also adopted the causes of other social movements such as environmentalism, feminism and progressivism.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.628","Socrates","","Socrates (; Ancient Greek: \u03a3\u03c9\u03ba\u03c1\u1fb0\u0301\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, romanized: S\u014dkr\u00e1t\u0113s, [s\u0254\u02d0kr\u00e1t\u025b\u02d0s]; c.\u2009470 \u2013 399 BC) was a classical  Greek (Athenian) philosopher credited as one of the founders of Western philosophy, and as being the first moral philosopher of the Western ethical tradition of thought.\nAn enigmatic figure, he made no writings, and is known chiefly through the accounts of classical writers writing after his lifetime, particularly his students Plato and Xenophon. Other sources include the contemporaneous Antisthenes, Aristippus, and Aeschines of Sphettos. Aristophanes, a playwright, is the main contemporary author to have written plays mentioning Socrates during Socrates' lifetime, though a fragment of Ion of Chios' Travel Journal provides important information about Socrates' youth.Plato's dialogues are among the most comprehensive accounts of Socrates to survive from antiquity, from which Socrates has become renowned for his contributions to the fields of ethics and epistemology. It is this Platonic Socrates who lends his name to the concepts of Socratic irony and the Socratic method, or elenchus. However, questions remain regarding the distinction between the real-life Socrates and Plato's portrayal of Socrates in his dialogues.\nSocrates exerted a strong influence on philosophers in later antiquity and in the modern era. Depictions of Socrates in art, literature and popular culture have made him one of the most widely known figures in the Western philosophical tradition.","wikipedia","5.2"

It is the largest of the Japanese new religions and claims the largest membership among Nichiren Buddhist groups. ""The organization bases its teachings on Nichiren's interpretation of the Lotus Sutra and places chanting ""Nam My\u014dh\u014d Renge Ky\u014d"" at the center of devotional practice. The organization promotes its goals as supporting ""peace, culture, and education"".The movement was founded by educators Makiguchi and Toda on 18 November 1930, and held its inaugural meeting in 1937. It was disbanded during the Second World War when much of the leadership was imprisoned for violations of the 1925 Peace Preservation Law and charges of l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9.  After the war, it expanded to a claimed total of 750,000 households in 1958 through explosive recruitment, held to be unprecedented in Japanese media. Further expansion was led by its former third president Daisaku Ikeda. According to its own account, it has 12 million members in 192 countries and territories around the world.\nMoving the group toward mainstream acceptance, the organization is still viewed with suspicion in Japan and has found itself embroiled in public controversies, especially in the first three decades following World War II. From 1952 to 1991, it was affiliated with the Nichiren Sh\u014dsh\u016b Buddhist sect.

"3.630","Solar power","","Solar power is the conversion of energy from sunlight into electricity, either directly using photovoltaics (PV), indirectly using concentrated solar power, or a combination. Concentrated solar power systems use lenses or mirrors and solar tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. Photovoltaic cells convert light into an electric current using the photovoltaic effect.Photovoltaics were initially solely used as a source of electricity for small and medium-sized applications, from the calculator powered by a single solar cell to remote homes powered by an off-grid rooftop PV system. Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s. As the cost of solar electricity has fallen, the number of grid-connected solar PV systems has grown into the millions and utility-scale photovoltaic power stations with hundreds of megawatts are being built. Solar PV is rapidly becoming an inexpensive, low-carbon technology to harness renewable energy from the Sun. The current largest photovoltaic power station in the world is the Pavagada Solar Park, Karnataka, India with a generation capacity of 2050 MW.The International Energy Agency projected in 2014 that under its ""high renewables"" scenario, by 2050, solar photovoltaics and concentrated solar power would contribute about 16 and 11 percent, respectively, of the worldwide electricity consumption, and solar would be the world's largest source of electricity. Most solar installations would be in China and India. In 2017, solar power provided 1.7% of total worldwide electricity production, growing 35% from the previous year. As of 2018, the unsubsidised levelised cost of electricity for utility-scale solar power is around $43/MWh.","wikipedia","5.4"

"3.631","South Park","","South Park is an American animated sitcom created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone and developed by Brian Graden for the Comedy Central television network. The series revolves around four boys\u2014Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick\u2014and their exploits in and around the titular Colorado town. The show became infamous for its profanity and dark, surreal humor that satirizes a wide range of topics towards a mature audience. \nParker and Stone developed the show from The Spirit of Christmas, two consecutive animated shorts. The latter became one of the first Internet viral videos, ultimately leading to South Park's production. The pilot episode was produced using cutout animation, leading to all subsequent episodes being produced with computer animation that emulated the cutout technique. South Park features a very large ensemble cast of recurring characters.\nSince its debut on August 13, 1997, 307 episodes of South Park have been broadcast. It debuted with great success, consistently earning the highest ratings of any basic cable program. Subsequent ratings have varied but it remains one of Comedy Central's highest-rated shows and is slated to air new episodes through 2022. Since 2000, each episode has typically been written and produced in the week preceding its broadcast, with Parker serving as the primary writer and director. The show's twenty-third season premiered on September 25, 2019.South Park has received numerous accolades, including five Primetime Emmy Awards, a Peabody Award, and numerous inclusions in various publications' lists of greatest television shows. The show's popularity resulted in a feature-length theatrical film, South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut which was released in June 1999, less than two years after the show's premiere, and became a commercial and critical success, and garnered a nomination for an Academy Award. In 2013, TV Guide ranked South Park the tenth Greatest TV Cartoon of All Time.","wikipedia","5.13"

The Russian Republic was composed of sixteen smaller constituent units of autonomous republics, five autonomous oblasts, ten autonomous okrugs, six krais and forty oblasts. Russians formed the largest ethnic group. The capital of the Russian SFSR was Moscow and the other major urban centers included Leningrad, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara.\nThe economy of Russia became heavily industrialized, accounting for about two-thirds of the electricity produced in the USSR. By 1961, it was the third largest producer of petroleum due to new discoveries in the Volga-Urals region and Siberia, trailing in production to only the United States and Saudi Arabia. In 1974, there were 475 institutes of higher education in the republic providing education in 47 languages to some 23,941,000 students. A network of territorially organized public-health services provided health care. After 1985, the ""perestroika"" restructuring policies of the Gorbachev administration relatively liberalised the economy, which had become stagnant since the late 1970s under General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev, with the introduction of non-state owned enterprises such as cooperatives.\nThe Russian Soviet Republic was proclaimed on 7 November 1917 (October Revolution) as a sovereign state and the world's first constitutionally socialist state with the ideology of Communism. The first Constitution was adopted in 1918. In 1922, the Russian SFSR signed the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR officially setting up of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The 1977 Soviet Constitution stated that ""[a] Union Republic is a sovereign [...] state that has united [...] in the Union"" and ""each Union Republic shall retain the right freely to secede from the USSR"". On 12 June 1990, the Congress of People's Deputies adopted the Declaration of State Sovereignty, established separation of powers (instead of Soviet form of government), established citizenship of Russia and stated that the RSFSR shall retain the right of free secession from the USSR. On 12 June 1991, Boris Yeltsin (1931\u20132007), supported by the Democratic Russia pro-reform movement, was elected the first and only President of the RSFSR, a post that would later become the presidency of the Russian Federation.\nThe August 1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt with the temporary brief internment of President Mikhail Gorbachev destabilised the Soviet Union. On 8 December 1991, the heads of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus signed the Belavezha Accords. The agreement declared dissolution of the USSR by its original founding states (i.e., renunciation of the 1922 Treaty on the Creation of the USSR) and established the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) as a loose confederation. On 12 December, the agreement was ratified by the Supreme Soviet (the Russian SFSR parliament); therefore the Russian SFSR had renounced the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR and de facto declared Russia's independence from the USSR itself and the ties with the other Soviet Socialist Republics.\nOn 25 December 1991, following the resignation of Gorbachev as President of the Soviet Union (and former General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union), the Russian SFSR was renamed the Russian Federation, with President Yeltsin re-establishing the sovereign and independent state (see history of Russia from 1991 onwards). With the lowering at 12 midnight of the flag of the now former USSR from the top of the Kremlin Senate building in Moscow on 26 December 1991, the USSR was self-dissolved by the Soviet of the Republics, which by that time was the only functioning chamber of the parliamentary Supreme Soviet (the other house, Soviet of the Union, had already lost the quorum after recall of its members by the several union republics). After dissolution of the USSR, Russia declared that it assumed the rights and obligations of the dissolved central Soviet government, including UN membership and permanent membership on the Security Council, but originally excluding foreign debt and foreign assets of the USSR (also parts of the former Soviet Red Army and nuclear weapons remained under overall CIS command as CIS United Armed Forces).\nThe 1978 RSFSR Constitution was amended several times to reflect the transition to democracy, private property and market economy. The new Russian Constitution, coming into effect on 25 December 1993 after a constitutional crisis, completely abolished the Soviet form of government and replaced it with a semi-presidential system.\n\n","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.634","Soviet Union","","The Soviet Union, officially known as the  Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR or \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420), was a federal sovereign state in northern Eurasia that existed from 1922 to 1991. Nominally a union of multiple national Soviet republics, in practice its government and economy were highly centralized. The country was a one-party state, governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital in its largest republic, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (Russian SFSR). Other major urban centers were Leningrad, Kiev, Minsk, Tashkent, Alma-Ata, and Novosibirsk. It spanned over 10,000 kilometers (6,200 mi) east to west across 11 time zones, and over 7,200 kilometers (4,500 mi) north to south. Its territory included much of Eastern Europe, as well as part of Northern Europe and all of Northern and Central Asia. It had five climate zones: tundra, taiga, steppes, desert and mountains.\nThe Soviet Union had its roots in the 1917 October Revolution, when the Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, overthrew the Russian Provisional Government which had replaced the autocratic regime of Tsar Nicholas II during World War I. In 1922, after a civil war ending in the Bolsheviks' victory, the USSR was formed by a treaty which united the Russian, Transcaucasian, Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics. Following Lenin's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle, Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s. Stalin formalized the Communist Party's ideology of Marxism\u2013Leninism and replaced the market economy with a command economy which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization. During this period, rapid economic development resulted in dramatic improvements in the average standard of living, particularly in urban areas. Despite these improvements, significant tragedies also occurred.  In addition to drought, which was a primary factor in a long history of regularly occurring famines in the region, agricultural collectivization contributed to a major famine in 1932\u201333, causing millions of deaths.  Political paranoia fermented, especially after the rise of the Nazis in Germany in 1933, culminating in the Great Purge, during which hundreds of thousands of persons accused of spying or sabotage were arrested and executed without trial.On 23 August 1939, after unsuccessful efforts to form an anti-fascist alliance with Western powers, the Soviets signed the non-aggression agreement with Nazi Germany. After the start of World War II, the formally neutral Soviets invaded and annexed territories of several Eastern European states, including Poland and the Baltic states. In June 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union, opening the most extensive and bloodiest theater of war in history. Soviet casualties accounted for the highest proportion of the war in the effort of acquiring the upper hand over the Axis forces at intense battles such as Stalingrad and Kursk. In most of the territories occupied by the Red Army after its westward advance, local communists assumed power and formed governments allied with the Soviets. The post-war division of Europe into capitalist and communist halves led to increased tensions with the United States-led Western Bloc, known as the Cold War. Stalin died in 1953 and was eventually succeeded by Nikita Khrushchev, who in 1956 denounced Stalin and began a period of liberal reforms known as de-Stalinization. The Cuban Missile Crisis occurred during Khrushchev's rule, which was among the many factors that led to his removal in 1964. In the early 1970s, there was a brief d\u00e9tente of relations with the United States, but tensions resumed with the Soviet\u2013Afghan War in 1979. In 1985, the last Soviet premier, Mikhail Gorbachev, sought to reform and liberalize the economy through his policies of glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring). These policies caused political instability arising from nationalist and separatist movements. In 1989, Soviet-allied states in Eastern Europe were overthrown in a wave of revolutions which ended communist rule.\nAs part of an attempt to prevent the country's collapse, a referendum was held in March 1991, boycotted by three republics, that resulted in a majority favoring the preservation of the union as a renewed federation. Gorbachev's power was greatly diminished after Russian President Boris Yeltsin's high-profile role in facing down a coup d'\u00e9tat by party hardliners. In late 1991, Gorbachev resigned, and the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union met and formally dissolved the union. The remaining 12 constituent republics emerged as independent post-Soviet states. Russian Federation\u2014formerly the Russian SFSR\u2014assumed the Soviet Union's rights and obligations and became recognized as the de facto successor state. At the same time, Ukraine by law declared that it is a state-successor of both Ukrainian SSR and the Soviet Union. Today, Russia and Ukraine have an ongoing dispute over formerly-Soviet property.The Soviet Union produced many significant technological achievements and innovations of the 20th century, including the world's first human-made satellite, the first humans in space and the first probe to land on another planet, Venus. The country had the world's second-largest economy and the largest standing military in the world. The USSR was recognized as one of the five nuclear weapons states and possessed the largest stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. It was a founding permanent member of the United Nations Security Council as well as a member of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) and the leading member of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) and the Warsaw Pact.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.636","Soviet war crimes","","War crimes perpetrated by the Soviet Union and its armed forces from 1919 to 1991 include acts committed by the Red Army (later called the Soviet Army) as well as the NKVD, including the NKVD's Internal Troops. In some cases, these acts were committed upon the orders of the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin in pursuance of the early Soviet Government's policy of Red Terror. In other instances they were committed without orders by Soviet troops against prisoners of war or civilians of countries that had been in armed conflict with the USSR, or they were committed during partisan warfare.A significant number of these incidents occurred in Northern, Central, and Eastern Europe before, during and in the aftermath of World War II, involving summary executions and the mass murder of prisoners of war, such as in the Katyn massacre and mass rape by troops of the Red Army in territories they occupied.\nWhen the Allied Powers of World War II founded the post-war International Military Tribunal to examine war crimes committed during the conflict by Nazi Germany, with officials from the Soviet Union taking an active part in the judicial processes, there was no examination of Soviet Forces' actions and no charges were ever brought against its troops, because they were also an undefeated power which then held Eastern Europe under military occupation, marring the historical authority of the Tribunal's activity as being, in part, victor's justice.Today, the Russian government regularly dismisses the war crimes as ""Western myth"". In Russian history textbooks, the atrocities are either altered to portray the Soviets positively or omitted entirely. In a June 2017 interview, Russian president Vladimir Putin acknowledged the ""horrors of Stalinism"", but he also criticized the ""excessive demonization of Stalin"" by ""Russia's enemies"".","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.640","Spanish–American War","","The Spanish\u2013American War (Spanish: Guerra Hispano-Americana; Filipino: Digmaang Espanyol-Amerikano) was an armed conflict between Spain and the United States in 1898. Hostilities began in the aftermath of the internal explosion of USS Maine in Havana Harbor in Cuba, leading to U.S. intervention in the Cuban War of Independence. The war led to emergence of U.S. predominance in the Caribbean region, and resulted in U.S. acquisition of Spain's Pacific possessions. That led to U.S. involvement in the Philippine Revolution and ultimately in the Philippine\u2013American War.The main issue was Cuban independence. Revolts had been occurring for some years in Cuba against Spanish rule. The U.S. later backed these revolts upon entering the Spanish\u2013American War. There had been war scares before, as in the Virginius Affair in 1873, but in the late 1890s, American public opinion was agitated by reports of gruesome Spanish atrocities. The business community had just recovered from a deep depression and feared that a war would reverse the gains. It lobbied vigorously against going to war. President William McKinley ignored the exaggerated yellow press and sought a peaceful settlement. The United States Navy armored cruiser USS Maine mysteriously exploded and sank in Havana Harbor; political pressures from the Democratic Party pushed McKinley into a war that he had wished to avoid.\nMcKinley signed a joint Congressional resolution demanding Spanish withdrawal and authorizing the President to use military force to help Cuba gain independence on April 20, 1898. In response, Spain severed diplomatic relations with the United States on April 21. On the same day, the U.S. Navy began a blockade of Cuba. Both sides declared war; neither had allies.\nThe ten-week war was fought in both the Caribbean and the Pacific. As U.S. agitators for war well knew, U.S. naval power would prove decisive, allowing expeditionary forces to disembark in Cuba against a Spanish garrison already facing nationwide Cuban insurgent attacks and further wasted by yellow fever.  The invaders obtained the surrender of Santiago de Cuba and Manila despite the good performance of some Spanish infantry units and fierce fighting for positions such as San Juan Hill. Madrid sued for peace after two Spanish squadrons were sunk in Santiago de Cuba and Manila Bay and a third, more modern, fleet was recalled home to protect the Spanish coasts.The result was the 1898 Treaty of Paris, negotiated on terms favorable to the U.S. which allowed it temporary control of Cuba and ceded ownership of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippine islands. The cession of the Philippines involved payment of $20 million ($614,640,000 today) to Spain by the U.S. to cover infrastructure owned by Spain.The defeat and loss of the last remnants of the Spanish Empire was a profound shock to Spain's national psyche and provoked a thorough philosophical and artistic reevaluation of Spanish society known as the Generation of '98. The United States gained several island possessions spanning the globe and a rancorous new debate over the wisdom of expansionism.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.637","Spanish Civil War","","The Spanish Civil War (Spanish: Guerra Civil Espa\u00f1ola) was a civil war in Spain fought from 1936 to 1939. Republicans loyal to the left-leaning Second Spanish Republic, in alliance with anarchists, of the communist and syndicalist variety, fought against a revolt by the Nationalists, an alliance of Falangists, monarchists, conservatives and Catholics, led by a military group among whom General Francisco Franco soon achieved a preponderant role. Due to the international political climate at the time, the war had many facets and was variously viewed as class struggle, a war of religion, a struggle between dictatorship and republican democracy, between revolution and counterrevolution, and between fascism and communism. It has been frequently called the ""dress rehearsal"" for World War II. The Nationalists won the war, which ended in early 1939, and ruled Spain until Franco's death in November 1975.\nThe war began after a pronunciamiento (a declaration of military opposition) against the Republican government by a group of generals of the Spanish Republican Armed Forces, originally under the leadership of Jos\u00e9 Sanjurjo. The government at the time was a coalition of Republicans, supported in the Cortes by communist and socialist parties, under the leadership of centre-left President Manuel Aza\u00f1a. The Nationalist group was supported by a number of conservative groups, including CEDA, monarchists, including both the opposing Alfonsists and the religious conservative Carlists, and the FE de las JONS, a fascist political party. After the deaths of Sanjurjo, Emilio Mola and Manuel Goded Llopis, Franco emerged as the remaining leader of the Nationalist side.\nThe coup was supported by military units in the Spanish protectorate in Morocco, Pamplona, Burgos, Zaragoza, Valladolid, C\u00e1diz, C\u00f3rdoba, and Seville. However, rebelling units in some important cities\u2014such as Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Bilbao, and M\u00e1laga\u2014did not gain control, and those cities remained under the control of the government. This left Spain militarily and politically divided. The Nationalists and the Republican government fought for control of the country. The Nationalist forces received munitions, soldiers, and air support from Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, while the Republican side received support from the Soviet Union and Mexico. Other countries, such as the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, continued to recognise the Republican government, but followed an official policy of non-intervention. Despite this policy, tens of thousands of citizens from non-interventionist countries directly participated in the conflict. They fought mostly in the pro-Republican International Brigades, which also included several thousand exiles from pro-Nationalist regimes.\nThe Nationalists advanced from their strongholds in the south and west, capturing most of Spain's northern coastline in 1937. They also besieged Madrid and the area to its south and west for much of the war. After much of Catalonia was captured in 1938 and 1939, and Madrid cut off from Barcelona, the Republican military position became hopeless. Following the fall without resistance of Barcelona in January 1939, the recognition of the Francoist regime by France and the United Kingdom in February 1939, and internal conflict between Republican factions in Madrid in March 1939, Franco entered the capital and declared victory on 1 April 1939. Hundreds of thousands of Spaniards fled to refugee camps in southern France. Those associated with the losing Republicans who stayed were persecuted by the victorious Nationalists. Franco established a dictatorship in which all right-wing parties were fused into the structure of the Franco regime.The war became notable for the passion and political division it inspired and for the many atrocities that occurred, on both sides. Organised purges occurred in territory captured by Franco's forces so they could consolidate their future regime. Mass executions on a lesser scale also took place in areas controlled by the Republicans, with the participation of local authorities varying from location to location.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.638","Spanish Inquisition","","The Tribunal of the Holy Office of the Inquisition (Spanish: Tribunal del Santo Oficio de la Inquisici\u00f3n), commonly known as the Spanish Inquisition (Inquisici\u00f3n espa\u00f1ola), was established in 1478 by Catholic Monarchs Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile. It was intended to maintain Catholic orthodoxy in their kingdoms and to replace the Medieval Inquisition, which was under Papal control. It became the most substantive of the three different manifestations of the wider Catholic Inquisition along with the Roman Inquisition and Portuguese Inquisition. The ""Spanish Inquisition"" may be defined broadly, operating in Spain and in all Spanish colonies and territories, which included the Canary Islands, the Kingdom of Naples, and all Spanish possessions in North, Central, and South America. According to modern estimates, around 150,000 were prosecuted for various offenses during the three-century duration of the Spanish Inquisition, out of which between 3,000 and 5,000 were executed (~2.7% of all cases).\nThe Inquisition was originally intended primarily to identify heretics among those who converted from Judaism and Islam to Catholicism. The regulation of the faith of newly converted Catholics was intensified after the royal decrees issued in 1492 and 1502 ordering Jews and Muslims to convert to Catholicism or leave Castile.  The Inquisition was not definitively abolished until 1834, during the reign of Isabella II, after a period of declining influence in the preceding century.\nThe Spanish Inquisition is often cited in popular literature and history as an example of religious intolerance and repression. Some historians have come to conclude that many of the charges levied against the Inquisition are exaggerated, and are a result of the Black Legend produced by political and religious enemies of Spain, especially England.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.639","Spanish in the United States","","The United States (Spanish: Estados Unidos) has 41 million people aged five or older who speak Spanish at home, making Spanish the second most spoken language of the United States by far. Spanish is the most studied foreign language in the United States, with about six million students. With over 50 million native speakers, heritage language speakers and second language speakers, the United States now has the second largest Spanish-speaking population in the world after Mexico, although it is not an official language of the country. About half of all American Spanish speakers also assessed themselves as speaking English ""very well"" in the 2000 U.S. Census. This percentage increased to 57% in the 2013\u20132017 American Community Survey. The United States is among the Spanish-speaking countries that has its own Academy of the Spanish Language.There are more Spanish-speakers in the United States than speakers of French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Hawaiian, varieties of Chinese and Native American languages combined. According to the 2012 American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, Spanish is spoken at home by 38.3 million people aged five or older, more than twice that of 1990.The Spanish language has been present in what is now the United States since the 15th century, with the arrival of Spanish colonization in North America. Colonizers settled in areas that would later become the states of Florida, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, and California, as well as the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The Spanish explorers explored areas of 42 future U.S. states leaving behind a varying range of Hispanic legacy in the North American continent. Western regions of the Louisiana Territory were also under Spanish rule between 1763 and 1800, after the French and Indian War, further extending the Spanish influence throughout the modern-day United States of America.\nAfter the incorporation of these areas into the United States in the first half of the 19th century, the Spanish language was later reinforced in the country by the acquisition of Puerto Rico in 1898. Later waves of emigration from Mexico, Cuba, Venezuela, El Salvador and elsewhere in Hispanic America to the United States beginning in the second half of the 19th century to the present-day have strengthened the role of the Spanish language in the country. Today, Hispanics are one of the fastest growing ethnic groups in the United States, thus increasing the use and importance of American Spanish in the United States.","wikipedia","5.10"
"3.641","Speciesism","","Speciesism () or specism is a form of discrimination based on species membership. It involves treating members of one species as morally more important than members of other species even when their interests are equivalent. More precisely, speciesism is the failure to consider interests of equal strength to an equal extent because of the species of which the individuals have been classified as belonging to.The term is often used by ethical vegans and animal rights advocates, who state that speciesism is a prejudice similar to racism or sexism, in that the treatment of individuals is predicated on group membership and morally irrelevant physical differences. It is thought that speciesism plays a role in inspiring or justifying cruelty in the forms of factory farming, the use of animals for entertainment such as in bullfighting and rodeos, the taking of animals' fur and skin, experimentation on animals, and the refusal to aid wild animals that suffer due to natural processes.An example of a speciesist belief would be the following: Suppose that both a dog and a cow need their tails removed for medical reasons. Suppose someone believes that the dog and the cow have equivalent interests, but insists that the dog receive pain relief for the operation, yet is fine with the cow's tail being docked without pain relief, remarking, ""it's just a cow."" This belief is speciesist because it disregards her interest in not suffering intense pain due to her species membership.It is possible to give more consideration to members of one species than to members of another species without being speciesist. For example, consider the belief that a typical human has an interest in voting but that a typical gorilla does not. This belief can involve starting with a premise that a certain feature of a being\u2014such as being able to understand and participate in a political system in which one has a political representative\u2014is relevant no matter the being's species. For someone holding this belief, a test for whether the belief is speciesist would be whether they would believe a gorilla who could understand and participate in a political system in which she had a political representative would have an interest in voting.\nThere are a few common speciesist paradigms. \n\nSimply considering humans superior to other animals. This is often called human supremacism\u2014the exclusion of all nonhuman animals from the rights, freedoms, and protections afforded to humans.\nConsidering certain nonhuman animals to be superior to others because of an arbitrary similarity, familiarity, or usefulness to humans. For example, what could be called ""human-chimpanzee speciesism"" would involve human beings favoring rights for chimpanzees over rights for (say) dolphins, because of happenstance similarities chimpanzees have to humans that dolphins do not. Similarly, the common practice of humans treating dogs much better than cattle may have to do with the fact that many humans live in closer proximity to dogs and/or find the cattle easier to use for their own gain.\nSimply considering individuals of certain species as superior to others. For example, treating pigs as though their well-being is unimportant, but treating horses as though their well-being is very important, even with the awareness that their mental capacities are similar.\nDeliberately harming or refusing aid to nonhuman animals in the wild classified as belonging to a certain species, in the name of preserving species, populations, biodiversity or ecosystems.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.642","Sperm donor","","Sperm donation is the provision by a man of his sperm with the intention that it be used in the artificial insemination or other 'fertility treatment' of a woman or women who are not his sexual partners in order that they may become pregnant by him.\nThe man is known as a 'sperm donor' and the sperm he provides is known as 'donor sperm' because the intention is that the man will give up all legal rights to any child produced from his sperm, and will not be the legal father.\nHowever conception is achieved, the nature and course of the pregnancy will be the same as one achieved by sexual intercourse, and the sperm donor will be the biological father of every child born from his donations.Sperm donation enables a man to father a child for third-party women, and is therefore, categorized as a form of third party reproduction.\nSperm may be donated by the donor directly to the intended recipient woman, or through a sperm bank or fertility clinic. Pregnancies are usually achieved by using donor sperm in assisted reproductive technology (ART) techniques which include artificial insemination (either by intracervical insemination (ICI) or intrauterine insemination (IUI) in a clinic, or intravaginal insemination at home). Less commonly, donor sperm may be used in in vitro fertilization (IVF). The primary recipients of donor sperm are single women, lesbian couples and heterosexual couples suffering from male infertility.Donor sperm and 'fertility treatments' using donor sperm may be obtained at a sperm bank or fertility clinic. Sperm banks or clinics may be subject to state or professional regulations, including restrictions on donor anonymity and the number of offspring that may be produced, and there may be other legal protections of the rights and responsibilities of both recipient and donor. Some sperm banks, either by choice or regulation, limit the amount of information available to potential recipients; a desire to obtain more information on donors is one reason why recipients may choose to use a known donor or private donation (i.e. a de-identified donor).","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.643","Stalking","","Stalking is unwanted and/or repeated surveillance by an individual or group toward another person. Stalking behaviors are interrelated to harassment and intimidation and may include following the victim in person or monitoring them. The term stalking is used with some differing definitions in psychiatry and psychology, as well as in some legal jurisdictions as a term for a criminal offense.According to a 2002 report by the U.S. National Center for Victims of Crime, ""virtually any unwanted contact between two people that directly or indirectly communicates a threat or places the victim in fear can be considered stalking"", although in practice the legal standard is usually somewhat stricter.","wikipedia","5.7"

"3.645","Star Trek","","Star Trek is an American media franchise based on the science fiction television series created by Gene Roddenberry. The first television series, called Star Trek and now known as ""The Original Series"", debuted on September 8, 1966 and aired for three seasons on NBC. It followed the voyages of the starship USS Enterprise on its five-year mission, the purpose of which was ""to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before!"". The USS Enterprise was a space exploration vessel built by the United Federation of Planets in the 23rd century. The Star Trek canon includes the Original Series, an animated series, six spin-off television series, the film franchise, and further adaptations in several media.\nIn creating Star Trek, Roddenberry was inspired by C. S. Forester's Horatio Hornblower series of novels, Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels, and television westerns such as Wagon Train. These adventures continued in the 22-episode Star Trek: The Animated Series and six feature films. six other television series were eventually produced: Star Trek: The Next Generation follows the crew of a new starship Enterprise, set a century after the original series; Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and Star Trek: Voyager are set contemporaneously with the Next Generation, and Enterprise is set before the original series in the early days of human interstellar travel. The most recent Star Trek television series, Star Trek: Discovery and Star Trek: Picard, stream exclusively on digital platforms. The adventures of the Next Generation crew continued in four additional feature films. In 2009, the film franchise underwent a reboot called the Kelvin Timeline. Three films were made in this alternate universe. An additional television series is in development, Star Trek: Lower Decks. Appearing on CBS All Access, it is scheduled to debut in 2020.\nStar Trek has been a cult phenomenon for decades. Fans of the franchise are called ""Trekkies"" or ""Trekkers"". The franchise spans a wide range of spin-offs including games, figurines, novels, toys, and comics. Star Trek had a themed attraction in Las Vegas that opened in 1998 and closed in September 2008. At least two museum exhibits of props travel the world. The series has its own full-fledged constructed language, Klingon. Several parodies have been made of Star Trek. In addition, viewers have produced several fan productions. As of July 2016, the franchise had generated $10 billion in revenue, making Star Trek one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.Star Trek is noted for its cultural influence beyond works of science fiction. The franchise is also noted for its progressive civil rights stances. The Original Series included one of television's first multiracial casts.","wikipedia","5.13"
"3.646","Star Wars","","Star Wars is an American epic space-opera media franchise created by George Lucas, which began with the eponymous 1977 film and quickly became a worldwide pop-culture phenomenon. The franchise has been expanded into various films and other media, including television series, video games, novels, comic books, theme park attractions, and themed areas, comprising an all-encompassing fictional universe. The franchise holds a Guinness World Records title for the ""Most successful film merchandising franchise"". In 2020, the total value of the Star Wars franchise was estimated at US$70 billion, and it is currently the fifth-highest-grossing media franchise of all time.\nThe original film, retroactively subtitled Episode IV: A New Hope, was followed by the sequels Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (1983), forming the original Star Wars trilogy. A prequel trilogy was later released, consisting of Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999), Episode II: Attack of the Clones (2002), and Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005). In 2012, Lucas sold his production company to Disney, relinquishing his ownership of the franchise. The subsequently-produced sequel trilogy consists of Episode VII: The Force Awakens (2015), Episode VIII: The Last Jedi (2017), and Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker (2019). Together, the three trilogies form what has been referred to as the ""Skywalker saga"". All nine films were nominated for Academy Awards (with wins going to the first two released) and were commercially successful. Together with the theatrical spin-off films Rogue One (2016) and Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018), the combined box office revenue of the films equates to over US$10 billion, and it is currently the second-highest-grossing film franchise.\n\n","wikipedia","5.13"
"3.647","Stem cell research","","Stem cells are cells that can differentiate into other types of cells, and can also divide in self-renewal to produce more of the same type of stem cells.\nTelomerase is active in normal stem cells.\nIn mammals, there are two broad types of stem cells: embryonic stem cells, which are isolated from the inner cell mass of blastocysts in early embryonic development, and adult stem cells, which are found in various tissues of fully developed mammals. In adult organisms, stem cells and progenitor cells act as a repair system for the body, replenishing adult tissues. In a developing embryo, stem cells can differentiate into all the specialized cells\u2014ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm (see induced pluripotent stem cells)\u2014but also maintain the normal turnover of regenerative organs, such as blood, skin, or intestinal tissues.\nThere are three known accessible sources of autologous adult stem cells in humans:\nbone marrow, adipose tissue, and blood. Stem cells can also be taken from umbilical cord blood just after birth. Of all stem cell therapy types, autologous harvesting involves the least risk.\nAdult stem cells are frequently used in various medical therapies (e.g., bone marrow transplantation). Stem cells can now be artificially grown and transformed (differentiated) into specialized cell types with characteristics consistent with cells of various tissues such as muscles or nerves. Embryonic cell lines and autologous embryonic stem cells generated through somatic cell nuclear transfer or dedifferentiation have also been proposed as promising candidates for future therapies. Research into stem cells grew out of findings by Ernest A. McCulloch and James E. Till at the University of Toronto in the 1960s.\n\n","wikipedia","['5.6','5.8']"
"3.648","Steven Universe","","Steven Universe is an American animated television series created by Rebecca Sugar for Cartoon Network. It is Cartoon Network's first animated series to be created solely by a woman. It is the coming-of-age story of a young boy, Steven Universe (voiced by Zach Callison), who lives with the Crystal Gems\u2014magical, humanoid aliens named Garnet (Estelle), Amethyst (Michaela Dietz), and Pearl (Deedee Magno Hall)\u2014in the fictional town of Beach City. Steven, who is half-Gem, has adventures with his friends and helps the Gems protect the world from their own kind. Its pilot was first shown on May 21, 2013, and the series premiered on November 4, 2013. Its fifth and final season concluded in January 2019. The TV film Steven Universe: The Movie was released on September 2, 2019, and an epilogue limited series, Steven Universe Future, premiered on December 7, 2019.\nThe themes of the series include love, family, and the importance of healthy interpersonal relationships. Sugar based the lead character on her younger brother Steven, who is an artist for the series. She developed Steven Universe while she was a writer and storyboard artist on Adventure Time, which she left when Cartoon Network commissioned her series for full production. The series is storyboard-driven; when episodes are being produced the show's storyboard artists are responsible for writing the dialogue and creating the action. Books, comics and video games based on the series have been released. \nThe series has developed a broad fan base and has been critically acclaimed for its design, music, voice acting, characterization, prominence of LGBTQ themes and science fantasy worldbuilding. The series won its first GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Kids & Family Program in 2019, becoming the first animated series to win the award. It also received its first Peabody Award for Children's & Youth Programming in 2019. It has been nominated for five Emmy Awards and five Annie Awards.","wikipedia","5.13"
"3.649","String theory","","In physics, string theory is a theoretical framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. It describes how these strings propagate through space and interact with each other. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string looks just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. In string theory, one of the many vibrational states of the string corresponds to the graviton, a quantum mechanical particle that carries gravitational force. Thus string theory is a theory of quantum gravity.\nString theory is a broad and varied subject that attempts to address a number of deep questions of fundamental physics. String theory has been applied to a variety of problems in black hole physics, early universe cosmology, nuclear physics, and condensed matter physics, and it has stimulated a number of major developments in pure mathematics. Because string theory potentially provides a unified description of gravity and particle physics, it is a candidate for a theory of everything, a self-contained mathematical model that describes all fundamental forces and forms of matter. Despite much work on these problems, it is not known to what extent string theory describes the real world or how much freedom the theory allows in the choice of its details. \nString theory was first studied in the late 1960s as a theory of the strong nuclear force, before being abandoned in favor of quantum chromodynamics. Subsequently, it was realized that the very properties that made string theory unsuitable as a theory of nuclear physics made it a promising candidate for a quantum theory of gravity. The earliest version of string theory, bosonic string theory, incorporated only the class of particles known as bosons. It later developed into superstring theory, which posits a connection called supersymmetry between bosons and the class of particles called fermions. Five consistent versions of superstring theory were developed before it was conjectured in the mid-1990s that they were all different limiting cases of a single theory in eleven dimensions known as M-theory. In late 1997, theorists discovered an important relationship called the AdS/CFT correspondence, which relates string theory to another type of physical theory called a quantum field theory.\nOne of the challenges of string theory is that the full theory does not have a satisfactory definition in all circumstances. Another issue is that the theory is thought to describe an enormous landscape of possible universes, and this has complicated efforts to develop theories of particle physics based on string theory. These issues have led some in the community to criticize these approaches to physics and question the value of continued research on string theory unification.\n\n","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.650","Strip club","","A strip club is a venue where strippers provide adult entertainment, predominantly in the form of striptease or other erotic or exotic dances. Strip clubs typically adopt a nightclub or bar style, and can also adopt a theatre or cabaret-style. American-style strip clubs began to appear outside North America after World War II, arriving in Asia in the late 1980s and Europe in 1978, where they competed against the local English and French styles of striptease and erotic performances.\nAs of 2005, the size of the global strip club industry was estimated to be US$75 billion. In 2019, the size of the U.S. strip club industry was estimated to be US$8 billion, generating 19% of the total gross revenue in legal adult entertainment. SEC filings and state liquor control records available at that time indicated that there were at least 3,862 strip clubs in the United States, and since that time, the number of clubs in the U.S. has grown. Profitability of strip clubs, as with other service-oriented businesses, is largely driven by location and customer spending habits. The better appointed a club is, in terms of its quality of facilities, equipment, furniture, and other elements, the more likely customers are to encounter cover charges and fees for premium features such as VIP rooms. The popularity of a given club is an indicator of its quality, as is the word-of-mouth among customers who have visited a cross section of clubs in different regions.\nThe strip club as an outlet for salacious entertainment is a recurrent theme in popular culture. In some media, these clubs are portrayed primarily as gathering places of vice and ill repute. Clubs themselves and various aspects of the business are highlighted in these references. ""Top Strip Club"" lists in some media have demonstrated that U.S.-style striptease is a global phenomenon and that it has also become a culturally accepted form of entertainment, despite its scrutiny in legal circles and popular media. Popular Internet sites for strip club enthusiasts also have lists calculated from the inputs of site visitors. The legal status of strip clubs has evolved over the course of time, with national and local laws becoming progressively more liberal on the issue around the world, although some countries (such as Iceland) have implemented strict limits and bans. Strip clubs are frequent targets of litigation around the world, and the sex industry, which includes strip clubs, is a contentious issue in popular culture and politics. Some clubs have been linked to organized crime.","wikipedia","5.12"
"3.651","Student athlete","","A student athlete (sometimes written student\u2013athlete) is a participant in an organized competitive sport sponsored by the educational institution in which the student is enrolled. Student-athletes are full-time students and athletes at the same time. Colleges offer athletic scholarships in many sports. Many student athletes receive scholarships to these institutions, but having a scholarship is not mandatory for a student athlete. In the United States, athletic scholarships are largely regulated\u2014by either the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) or the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), which sets minimum standards for both the individuals awarded the scholarships (in terms of GPAs and standardized test scores) and for the institutions that grant them (in terms of the form and value of the scholarships and the proportion of recipients who must ultimately earn degrees). Also students that are very talented may get scholarships for playing a particular sport. The term student-athlete was coined in 1964 by Walter Byers, the first-ever executive director of the NCAA, to counter attempts to require universities to pay workers' compensation.When choosing a college, a student may sign The National Letter of Intent. The NLI is an agreement between the athlete and the institution that certifies they are entering a four-year institution for the first time. The school must offer financial aid, and the student must meet the institution's admission requirements. It is a belief that student athletes comprise one of the most diverse groups of people on our college campuses today, particularly with regard to factors such as personal history, academic preparedness, life goals and expectations, physical and psychological skills, and developmental readiness. Student athletes are likely to come into contact with important and influential alumni who can help them during their college years and - most importantly- after college.","wikipedia","5.11"

[by particular] values, ritual practices, doctrines and institutions"" which began very early in Islamic history and represents ""the main manifestation and the most important and central crystallization of"" mystical practice in Islam. Practitioners of Sufism have been referred to as ""Sufis"" (from \u0635\u064f\u0648\u0641\u0650\u064a\u0651\u200e \u1e63\u016bfiyy / \u1e63\u016bf\u012b).Historically, Sufis have often belonged to different \u1e6duruq or ""orders"" \u2013 congregations formed around a grand master referred to as a wali who traces a direct chain of successive teachers back to the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. These orders meet for spiritual sessions (majalis) in meeting places known as zawiyas, khanqahs or tekke. They strive for ihsan (perfection of worship), as detailed in a hadith: ""Ihsan is to worship Allah as if you see Him; if you can't see Him, surely He sees you."" Sufis regard Muhammad as al-Ins\u0101n al-K\u0101mil, the primary perfect man who exemplifies the morality of God, and see him as their leader and prime spiritual guide.\nAll Sufi orders trace most of their original precepts from Muhammad through his cousin and son-in-law Ali, with the notable exception of the Naqshbandi order, who trace their original precepts to Muhammad through his companion and father-in-law, Abu Bakr.\nIt has historically been mistaken as a sect of Islam, when it is in fact a religious order for any Islamic denomination.Although the overwhelming majority of Sufis, both pre-modern and modern, were and are adherents of Sunni Islam, there also developed certain strands of Sufi practice within the ambit of Shia Islam during the late medieval period, particularly after the forced conversion of Iran from majority Sunni to Shia. Traditional Sufi orders during the first five centuries of Islam were all based in Sunni Islam. Although Sufis were opposed to dry legalism, they strictly observed Islamic law and belonged to various schools of Islamic jurisprudence and theology.Sufis have been characterized by their asceticism, especially by their attachment to dhikr, the practice of remembrance of God, often performed after prayers. They gained adherents among a number of Muslims as a reaction against the worldliness of the early Umayyad Caliphate (661\u2013750)\nand have spanned several continents and cultures over a millennium, initially expressing their beliefs in Arabic and later expanding into Persian, Turkish, and Urdu, among others. Sufis played an important role in the formation of Muslim societies through their missionary and educational activities. According to William Chittick, ""In a broad sense, Sufism can be described as the interiorization, and intensification of Islamic faith and practice.""Despite a relative decline of Sufi orders in the modern era and criticism of some aspects of Sufism by modernist thinkers and conservative Salafists, Sufism has continued to play an important role in the Islamic world, and has also influenced various forms of spirituality in the West.","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.654","Super Bowl XXXVIII","","Super Bowl XXXVIII was an American football game between the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Carolina Panthers and the American Football Conference (AFC) champion New England Patriots to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 2003 season. The Patriots  defeated the Panthers by a score of 32\u201329.  The game was played at Reliant Stadium in Houston, Texas, on February 1, 2004. At the time, this was the most watched Super Bowl ever with 144.4 million viewers.The Panthers were making their first ever Super Bowl appearance after posting an 11\u20135 regular season record. They also made it the second straight year that a team from the NFC South division made the Super Bowl, with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers winning Super Bowl XXXVII.  The Patriots were seeking their second Super Bowl title in three years after posting a 14\u20132 record.\nNFL fans and sports writers widely consider this game one of the most well-played and thrilling Super Bowls; Sports Illustrated writer Peter King hailed it as the ""Greatest Super Bowl of all time."" Although neither team could score in the first and third quarters, they ended up with a combined total of 868 yards and 61 points. The game was scoreless for a Super Bowl record 26:55 before the two teams combined for 24 points prior to halftime. The clubs then combined for a Super Bowl record 37 points in the fourth quarter. The contest was finally decided when the Patriots kicker Adam Vinatieri's 41-yard field goal was made with four seconds left. Patriots quarterback Tom Brady was named Super Bowl MVP for the second time in his career.\nThe game is also known for its controversial halftime show in which Janet Jackson's breast, adorned with a nipple shield, was exposed by Justin Timberlake for about half a second, in what was later referred to as a ""wardrobe malfunction"". Along with the rest of the halftime show, it led to an immediate crackdown by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and widespread debate on perceived indecency in broadcasting.\n\n","wikipedia","5.11"
"3.655","Surrogate mother","","Surrogacy is an arrangement, often supported by a legal agreement, whereby a woman (the surrogate mother) agrees to bear a child for another person or persons, who will become the child's parent(s) after birth.\nPeople may seek a surrogacy arrangement when pregnancy is medically impossible, when pregnancy risks are too dangerous for the intended mother, or when a single man or a male couple wish to have a child. Surrogacy is considered one of many assisted reproductive technologies.\nIn surrogacy arrangements, monetary compensation may or may not be involved. Receiving money for the arrangement is known as commercial surrogacy. The legality and cost of surrogacy varies widely between jurisdictions, sometimes resulting in problematic international or interstate surrogacy arrangements. Couples seeking a surrogacy arrangement in a country where it is banned sometimes travel to a jurisdiction that permits it. In some countries, surrogacy is only legal if money does not exchange hands. (See surrogacy laws by country and fertility tourism.)\nWhere commercial surrogacy is legal, couples may use the help of third-party agencies to assist in the process of surrogacy by finding a surrogate and arranging a surrogacy contract with her. These agencies often screen surrogates' psychological and other medical tests to ensure the best chance of healthy gestation and delivery. They also usually facilitate all legal matters concerning the intended parents and the surrogate.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.656","Swinging (sexual practice)","","Swinging, sometimes called wife swapping, husband swapping or partner swapping, is sexual activity in which both singles and partners in a committed relationship engage in such activities with others as a recreational or social activity. Swinging is a form of non-monogamy and is an open relationship. People may choose a swinging lifestyle for a variety of reasons. Many cite an increased quality and quantity of sex. Some people may engage in swinging to add variety into their otherwise conventional sex lives or due to their curiosity. Some couples see swinging as a healthy outlet and means to strengthen their relationship.The phenomenon of swinging, or at least its wider discussion and practice, is regarded by some as arising from the freer attitudes to sexual activity after the sexual revolution of the 1960s, the invention and availability of the contraceptive pill, and the emergence of treatments for many of the sexually transmitted diseases that were known at that time. The adoption of safe sex practices became more common in the late 1980s.\nThe swinger community sometimes refers to itself as ""the lifestyle"", or as ""the alternative lifestyle"".","wikipedia","5.7"

It advocates the establishment of a Syrian nation state spanning the Fertile Crescent, including present day Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Kuwait, Jordan, Palestine, Israel, Cyprus, Sinai, southeastern Turkey (Alexandrette and Cilicia), based on geographical boundaries and the common history people within the boundaries share.With over 100,000 members as of 2016, it is the second largest legal political group in Syria after the ruling Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party, In Lebanon, it has been a major secular and highly organised elite party in the political history of the country for over 80 years.  Until recent times it was a key group in the March 8 Alliance.\nFounded in Beirut in 1932 as an anticolonial and national liberation organization hostile to French colonialism,  the party played a significant role in Lebanese politics and was involved in attempted coups d'etat in 1949 and 1961 following which it was thoroughly repressed. It was active in resistance against the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and the subsequent occupation of southern Lebanon until 2000 while continuously supporting the Syrian presence in Lebanon out of both belief in Syrian irredentism but also due to the decades-long repression it endured at the hands of the Baath Party in Syria. In Syria, the SSNP had become a major Right-wing political force in the early 1950s, but was thoroughly repressed in 1955-56. It remained organized, and by the late 1990s had joined the Left and allied itself with the PLO and the Lebanese Communist Party, despite the ideological rivalry that persists among them. In 2005, it was legalized in Syria and joined the Ba'ath Party-led National Progressive Front. From 2012 to 6 May 2014, the party was part of the Popular Front for Change and Liberation.During the course of the Syrian Civil War the party has seen its relevance increasing in Syria, where almost 12,000 fighters of the Party's armed branch, the Eagles of the Whirlwind, fight alongside the Syrian Armed Forces against the Syrian opposition and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.661","Taboo","","A taboo is an implicit prohibition on something (usually against an utterance or behavior) based on a cultural sense that it is excessively repulsive or, perhaps, too sacred for ordinary people. Such prohibitions are present in virtually all societies. On a comparative basis taboos, for example related to food items, seem to make no sense at all as what may be declared unfit for one group by custom or religion may be perfectly acceptable to another.\nTaboos are often meant to protect the human individual, but there are numerous other reasons for their existence. An ecological or medical background is apparent in many, including some that are seen as religious or spiritual in origin. Taboos can help use a resource more efficiently, but when applied to only a subsection of the community they can also serve to suppress a subsection of the community. A taboo acknowledged by a particular group or tribe as part of their ways, aids in the cohesion of the group, helps that particular group to stand out and maintain its identity in the face of others and therefore creates a feeling of ""belonging"".The meaning of the word ""taboo"" has been somewhat expanded in the social sciences to strong prohibitions relating to any area of human activity or custom that is sacred or forbidden based on moral judgment, religious beliefs, or cultural norms. ""Breaking a taboo"" is usually considered objectionable by society in general, not merely a subset of a culture.","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.662","Taliban","","The Taliban (Pashto: \u0637\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0627\u0646\u200e, \u1e6d\u0101lib\u0101n ""students"") or Taleban, who refer to themselves as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA), are a Sunni Islamic fundamentalist political movement and military organization in Afghanistan currently waging war (an insurgency, or jihad) within that country. Since 2016, the Taliban's leader is Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada.From 1996 to 2001, the Taliban held power over roughly three quarters of Afghanistan, and enforced there a strict interpretation of Sharia, or Islamic law. The Taliban emerged in 1994 as one of the prominent factions in the Afghan Civil War and largely consisted of students (talib) from the Pashtun areas of eastern and southern Afghanistan who had been educated in traditional Islamic schools, and fought during the Soviet\u2013Afghan War. Under the leadership of Mohammed Omar, the movement spread throughout most of Afghanistan, sequestering power from the Mujahideen warlords. The totalitarian Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan was established in 1996 and the Afghan capital was transferred to Kandahar. It held control of most of the country until being overthrown after the American-led invasion of Afghanistan in December 2001 following the September 11 attacks. At its peak, formal diplomatic recognition of the Taliban's government was acknowledged by only three nations: Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. The group later regrouped as an insurgency movement to fight the American-backed Karzai administration and the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in the War in Afghanistan.\nThe Taliban have been condemned internationally for the harsh enforcement of their interpretation of Islamic Sharia law, which has resulted in the brutal treatment of many Afghans, especially women.  During their rule from 1996 to 2001, the Taliban and their allies committed massacres against Afghan civilians, denied UN food supplies to 160,000 starving civilians and conducted a policy of scorched earth, burning vast areas of fertile land and destroying tens of thousands of homes.  According to the United Nations, the Taliban and their allies were responsible for 76% of Afghan civilian casualties in 2010, 80% in 2011, and 80% in 2012. Taliban has also engaged in cultural genocide, destroying numerous monuments including the famous 1500-year old Buddhas of Bamiyan.The Taliban's ideology has been described as combining an ""innovative"" form of sharia Islamic law based on Deobandi fundamentalism and the militant Islamism and Salafi jihadism of Osama bin Laden with Pashtun social and cultural norms known as Pashtunwali, as most Taliban are Pashtun tribesmen.\nThe Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence and military are widely alleged by the international community and the Afghan government to have provided support to the Taliban during their founding and time in power, and of continuing to support the Taliban during the insurgency. Pakistan states that it dropped all support for the group after the September 11 attacks. In 2001, reportedly 2,500 Arabs under command of Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden fought for the Taliban.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.663","Talk radio","","Talk radio is a radio format containing discussion about topical issues and consisting entirely or almost entirely of original spoken word content rather than outside music. Most shows are regularly hosted by a single individual, and often feature interviews with a number of different guests. Talk radio typically includes an element of listener participation, usually by broadcasting live conversations between the host and listeners who ""call in"" (usually via telephone) to the show. Listener contributions are usually screened by a show's producers in order to maximize audience interest and, in the case of commercial talk radio, to attract advertisers. Generally, the shows are organized into segments, each separated by a pause for advertisements; however, in public or non-commercial radio, music is sometimes played in place of commercials to separate the program segments. Variations of talk radio include conservative talk, hot talk, liberal talk (increasingly known as progressive talk) and sports talk.\nWhile talk radio has historically been associated with broadcast radio, starting around 2005 the technology for Internet-based talk-radio shows became cost effective in the form of live Internet website streaming and podcasts. Now, it is possible for an individual to use a variety of services to host an Internet-based talk-radio show without carriage by a traditional radio station. In addition, TV programming from talk and news outlets such as BBC, CNN, Bloomberg and Fox is now often available expanding the world of talk radio further. Talk radio listening is enjoyed not only on radios, but a wide variety of other devices and services including PCs using iTunes, station directories such as TuneIn, show directory smartphones with apps such as Stitcher and time-shifting services like DAR.fm.","wikipedia","5.13"
"3.664","Tax","","A tax (from the Latin taxo) is a compulsory financial charge or some other type of levy imposed upon a taxpayer (an individual or legal entity) by a governmental organization in order to fund various public expenditures. A failure to pay, along with evasion of or resistance to taxation, is punishable by law. Taxes consist of direct or indirect taxes and may be paid in money or as its labour equivalent. The first known taxation took place in Ancient Egypt around 3000\u20132800 BC.\nMost countries have a tax system in place to pay for public, common or agreed national needs and government functions. Some levy a flat percentage rate of taxation on personal annual income, but most scale taxes based on annual income amounts. Most countries charge a tax on an individual's income as well as on corporate income. Countries or subunits often also impose wealth taxes, inheritance taxes, estate taxes, gift taxes, property taxes, sales taxes, payroll taxes or tariffs.\nIn economic terms, taxation transfers wealth from households or businesses to the government. This has effects which can both increase and reduce economic growth and economic welfare. Consequently, taxation is a highly debated topic.","wikipedia","5.0"
"3.665","Tay–Sachs disease","","Tay\u2013Sachs disease is a genetic disorder that results in the destruction of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. The most common type, known as infantile Tay\u2013Sachs disease, becomes apparent around three to six months of age with the baby losing the ability to turn over, sit, or crawl. This is then followed by seizures, hearing loss, and inability to move. Death usually occurs in early childhood. Less commonly the disease may occur in later childhood or adulthood. These forms are generally milder in nature.Tay\u2013Sachs disease is caused by a genetic mutation in the HEXA gene on chromosome 15. It is inherited from a person's parents in an autosomal recessive manner. The mutation results in problems with an enzyme called beta-hexosaminidase A which results in the buildup of the molecule GM2 ganglioside within cells, leading to toxicity. Diagnosis may be supported by measuring the blood hexosaminidase A level or genetic testing. It is a type of GM2 gangliosidosis and a type of sphingolipidosis.The treatment of Tay\u2013Sachs disease is supportive in nature. This may involve multiple specialities as well as psychosocial support for the family. The disease is rare in the general population. In Ashkenazi Jews, French Canadians of southeastern Quebec, the Old Order Amish of Pennsylvania, and the Cajuns of southern Louisiana, the condition is more common. Approximately 1 in 3,600 Ashkenazi Jews at birth are affected.The disease is named after Waren Tay, who in 1881 first described a symptomatic red spot on the retina of the eye; and Bernard Sachs, who described in 1887 the cellular changes and noted an increased rate of disease in Ashkenazi Jews. Carriers of a single Tay\u2013Sachs allele are typically normal. It has been hypothesized that being a carrier may confer protection from tuberculosis, explaining the persistence of the allele in certain populations. Researchers are looking at gene therapy or enzyme replacement therapy as possible treatments..\n\n","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.666","Tea Party movement","","The Tea Party movement is an American fiscally conservative political movement within the Republican Party. Members of the movement have called for lower taxes, and for a reduction of the national debt of the United States and federal budget deficit through decreased government spending. The movement supports small-government principles and opposes government-sponsored universal healthcare. The Tea Party movement has been described as a popular constitutional movement composed of a mixture of libertarian, right-wing populist, and conservative activism. It has sponsored multiple protests and supported various political candidates since 2009. According to the American Enterprise Institute, various polls in 2013 estimated that slightly over 10 percent of Americans identified as part of the movement.The Tea Party movement was launched following a February 19, 2009, call by CNBC reporter Rick Santelli on the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for a ""tea party"", several conservative activists agreed by conference call to coalesce against President Obama's agenda and scheduled series of protests. Supporters of the movement subsequently have had a major impact on the internal politics of the Republican Party. Although the Tea Party is not a party in the classic sense of the word, some research suggests that members of the Tea Party Caucus vote like a significantly farther right third party in Congress. A major force behind it was Americans for Prosperity (AFP), a conservative political advocacy group founded by businessmen and political activist David H. Koch. It is unclear exactly how much money is donated to AFP by David and his brother Charles Koch. By 2019, it was reported that the conservative wing of the Republican Party ""has basically shed the tea party moniker"".The movement's name refers to the Boston Tea Party of December 16, 1773, a watershed event in the launch of the American Revolution. The 1773 event demonstrated against taxation by the British government without political representation for the American colonists, and references to the Boston Tea Party and even costumes from the 1770s era are commonly heard and seen in the Tea Party movement.","wikipedia","5.5"

The plaza is dominated by three monumental structures from the early Umayyad period: the al-Aqsa Mosque, the Dome of the Rock and the Dome of the Chain, as well as four minarets. Herodian walls and gates, with additions from the late Byzantine and early Islamic periods, cut through the flanks of the Mount. Currently it can be reached through eleven gates, ten reserved for Muslims and one for non-Muslims, with guard posts of Israeli police in the vicinity of each.According to Jewish tradition and scripture, the First Temple was built by King Solomon the son of King David in 957 BCE and destroyed by the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 586 BCE \u2013 however no substantial archaeological evidence has verified this. The Second Temple was constructed under the auspices of Zerubbabel in 516 BCE and destroyed by the Roman Empire in 70 CE. Jewish tradition maintains it is here that a third and final Temple will also be built. The location is the holiest site in Judaism and is the place Jews turn towards during prayer. Due to its extreme sanctity, many Jews will not walk on the Mount itself, to avoid unintentionally entering the area where the Holy of Holies stood, since according to Rabbinical law, some aspect of the divine presence is still present at the site.Among Muslims, the Mount is the site of one of the three Sacred Mosques, the holiest sites in Islam. Amongst Sunni Muslims, it is considered the third holiest site in Islam. Revered as the Noble Sanctuary, the location of Muhammad's journey to Jerusalem and ascent to heaven, the site is also associated with Jewish biblical prophets who are also venerated in Islam. Umayyad Caliphs commissioned the construction of the al-Aqsa Mosque and Dome of the Rock on the site. The Dome was completed in 692 CE, making it one of the oldest extant Islamic structures in the world. The Al Aqsa Mosque rests on the far southern side of the Mount, facing Mecca. The Dome of the Rock currently sits in the middle, occupying or close to the area where the Holy Temple previously stood.In light of the dual claims of both Judaism and Islam, it is one of the most contested religious sites in the world. Since the Crusades, the Muslim community of Jerusalem has managed the site as a Waqf. The Temple Mount is within the Old City, which has been controlled by Israel since 1967. After the Six-Day War, Israel handed administration of the site back to the Waqf under Jordanian custodianship, while maintaining Israeli security control. It remains a major focal point of the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict. In an attempt to keep the status quo, the Israeli government enforces a controversial ban on prayer by non-Muslims.","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.669","Terrorism","","Terrorism is, in the broadest sense, the use of intentional violence for political or religious purposes. It is used in this regard primarily to refer to violence during peacetime or in the context of war against non-combatants (mostly civilians and neutral military personnel). The terms ""terrorist"" and ""terrorism"" originated during the French Revolution of the late 18th century but gained mainstream popularity in the 1970s during the conflicts of Northern Ireland, the Basque Country and Palestine. The increased use of suicide attacks from the 1980s onwards was typified by the September 11 attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C. in 2001.\nThere are different definitions of terrorism. Terrorism is a charged term. It is often used with the connotation of something that is ""morally wrong"". Governments and non-state groups use the term to abuse or denounce opposing groups. Varied political organizations have been accused of using terrorism to achieve their objectives. These include right-wing and left-wing political organizations, nationalist groups, religious groups, revolutionaries and ruling governments. Legislation declaring terrorism a crime has been adopted in many states. When terrorism is perpetrated by nation states, it is not considered terrorism by the state conducting it, making legality a largely grey-area issue. There is no consensus as to whether or not terrorism should be regarded as a war crime.The Global Terrorism Database, maintained by the University of Maryland, College Park, has recorded more than 61,000 incidents of non-state terrorism, resulting in at least 140,000 deaths, between 2000 and 2014.\n\n","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.670","Terrorist groups","","A number of national governments and international organisations have created lists of designated terrorist organisations, though there is no consistency as to which organisations are so designated. The following list of designated terrorist groups have been created by national governments, former governments, and inter-governmental organizations. Such designations have had a significant effect on the groups\u2019 activities. Many organizations that have been designated as terrorist organization have denied using terrorism as a military tactic to achieve their goals, and there is no international consensus on the legal definition of terrorism. Some organisations have multiple wings or components, one or more of which may be designated as terrorist while others are not.\nThis listing does not include unaffiliated individuals accused of terrorism, which are considered under lone wolf terrorism. This list also excludes groups which might be widely considered terrorist, but who are not officially so designated according to the criteria specified above.\nThis list is not all inclusive. For more inclusive lists, including people, entities (corporations), and specific vehicles, refer to lists under Process of designation.\nThere are near about 210 recognised terrorist organisations.\n\n","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.671","Test-tube babies","","In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is a process of fertilisation where an egg is combined with sperm outside the body, in vitro (""in glass""). The process involves monitoring and stimulating a woman's ovulatory process, removing an ovum or ova (egg or eggs) from the woman's ovaries and letting sperm fertilise them in a liquid in a laboratory. After the fertilised egg (zygote) undergoes embryo culture for 2\u20136 days, it is implanted in the same or another woman's uterus, with the intention of establishing a successful pregnancy.\nIVF is a type of assisted reproductive technology used for infertility treatment and gestational surrogacy. A fertilised egg may be implanted into a surrogate's uterus, and the resulting child is genetically unrelated to the surrogate. Some countries have banned or otherwise regulate the availability of IVF treatment, giving rise to fertility tourism. Restrictions on the availability of IVF include costs and age, in order for a woman to carry a healthy pregnancy to term. IVF is generally not used until less invasive or expensive options have failed or been determined unlikely to work.\nIn 1978 Louise Brown was the first child successfully born after her mother received IVF treatment. Brown was born as a result of natural-cycle IVF, where no stimulation was made. The procedure took place at Dr Kershaw's Cottage Hospital (now Dr Kershaw's Hospice) in Royton, Oldham, England. Robert G. Edwards was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2010. The physiologist co-developed the treatment together with Patrick Steptoe and embryologist Jean Purdy but the latter two were not eligible for consideration as they had died and the Nobel Prize is not awarded posthumously.With egg donation and IVF, women who are past their reproductive years, have infertile male partners, have idiopathic female-fertility issues, or have reached menopause can still become pregnant. After the IVF treatment, some couples get pregnant without any fertility treatments. In 2018 it was estimated that eight million children had been born worldwide using IVF and other assisted reproduction techniques. However, a recent study that explores 10 adjuncts with IVF (screening hysteroscopy, DHEA, testosterone, GH, aspirin, heparin, antioxidants in males and females, seminal plasma, and PRP) suggests that until more evidence is done to show that these adjuncts are safe and effective, they should be avoided. \n\n","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.672","Texas Revolution","","The Texas Revolution (October 2, 1835 \u2013 April 21, 1836) was a rebellion of colonists from the United States and Tejanos (Texas Mexicans) in putting up armed resistance to the centralist government of Mexico. While the uprising was part of a larger one that included other provinces opposed to the regime of President Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna, the Mexican government believed the United States had instigated the Texas insurrection with the goal of annexation. The Mexican Congress passed the Tornel Decree, declaring that any foreigners fighting against Mexican troops ""will be deemed pirates and dealt with as such, being citizens of no nation presently at war with the Republic and fighting under no recognized flag."" Only the province of Texas succeeded in breaking with Mexico, establishing the Republic of Texas, and eventually being annexed by the United States.\nThe revolution began in October 1835, after a decade of political and cultural clashes between the Mexican government and the increasingly large population of American settlers in Texas. The Mexican government had become increasingly centralized and the rights of its citizens had become increasingly curtailed, particularly regarding immigration from the United States. Colonists and Tejanos disagreed on whether the ultimate goal was independence or a return to the Mexican Constitution of 1824.  While delegates at the Consultation (provisional government) debated the war's motives, Texians and a flood of volunteers from the United States defeated the small garrisons of Mexican soldiers by mid-December 1835. The Consultation declined to declare independence and installed an interim government, whose infighting led to political paralysis and a dearth of effective governance in Texas.  An ill-conceived proposal to invade Matamoros siphoned much-needed volunteers and provisions from the fledgling Texian Army.  In March 1836, a second political convention declared independence and appointed leadership for the new Republic of Texas.\nDetermined to avenge Mexico's honor, Santa Anna vowed to personally retake Texas.  His Army of Operations entered Texas in mid-February 1836 and found the Texians completely unprepared. Mexican General Jos\u00e9 de Urrea led a contingent of troops on the Goliad Campaign up the Texas coast, defeating all Texian troops in his path and executing most of those who surrendered. Santa Anna led a larger force to San Antonio de B\u00e9xar (or B\u00e9xar), where his troops defeated the Texian garrison in the Battle of the Alamo, killing almost all of the defenders. \nA newly created Texian army under the command of Sam Houston was constantly on the move, while terrified civilians fled with the army, in a melee known as the Runaway Scrape. On March 31, Houston paused his men at Groce's Landing on the Brazos River, and for the next two weeks, the Texians received rigorous military training. Becoming complacent and underestimating the strength of his foes, Santa Anna further subdivided his troops. On April 21, Houston's army staged a surprise assault on Santa Anna and his vanguard force at the Battle of San Jacinto. The Mexican troops were quickly routed, and vengeful Texians executed many who tried to surrender.  Santa Anna was taken hostage; in exchange for his life, he ordered the Mexican army to retreat south of the Rio Grande.  Mexico refused to recognize the Republic of Texas, and intermittent conflicts between the two countries continued into the 1840s.  The annexation of Texas as the 28th state of the United States, in 1845, led directly to the Mexican\u2013American War.","wikipedia","5.6"

It involved a large-scale purge of the Communist Party and government officials, repression of kulaks (affluent peasants) and the Red Army leadership, widespread police surveillance, suspicion of saboteurs, counter-revolutionaries, imprisonment, and arbitrary executions. Historians estimate the total number of deaths due to Stalinist repression in 1937\u201338 to be between 680,000 and 1,200,000.\nIn the Western world, Robert Conquest's 1968 book The Great Terror popularized that phrase. Conquest's title was in turn an allusion to the period called the Reign of Terror during the French Revolution (French: la Terreur, and, from June to July 1794, la Grande Terreur, the Great Terror).","wikipedia","5.6"

It describes the events leading up to the Nanking Massacre and the atrocities that were committed. The book presents the view that the Japanese government has not done enough to redress the atrocities. It is one of the first major English-language books to introduce the Nanking Massacre to Western and Eastern readers alike, and has been translated into several languages.The book received both acclaim and criticism by the public and by academics. It has been praised as a work that ""shows more clearly than any previous account"" the extent and brutality of the episode, while at the same time it was criticized as ""seriously flawed"" and ""full of misinformation and harebrained explanations"". Chang's research on the book was credited with the finding of the diaries of John Rabe and Minnie Vautrin, both of whom played important roles in the Nanking Safety Zone, a designated area in Nanjing that protected Chinese civilians during the Nanking Massacre.The book prompted AOL executive Ted Leonsis to fund and produce Nanking, a 2007 documentary film about the Nanking Massacre.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.677","Therapeutic touch","","Therapeutic touch (commonly shortened to ""TT""), known by some as ""non-contact therapeutic touch"" (NCTT), is a pseudoscientific energy therapy which practitioners claim promotes healing and reduces pain and anxiety. ""Therapeutic Touch"" is a registered trademark in Canada for the ""[s]tructured and standardized healing practice performed by practitioners trained to be sensitive to the receiver's energy field that surrounds the body;...no touching is required.""Practitioners of therapeutic touch state that by placing their hands on, or near, a patient, they are able to detect and manipulate what they say is the patient's energy field. One highly cited study, designed by the then-nine-year-old Emily Rosa and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1998, found that practitioners of therapeutic touch could not detect the presence or absence of a hand placed a few inches above theirs when their vision was obstructed. Simon Singh and Edzard Ernst concluded in their 2008 book Trick or Treatment that ""the energy field was probably nothing more than a figment in the imaginations of the healers"". The American Cancer Society has noted, ""Available scientific evidence does not support any claims that TT can cure cancer or other diseases."" A 2014 Cochrane review found no good evidence that it helped with wound healing.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.676","The Simpsons","","The Simpsons is an American animated sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series is a satirical depiction of working-class life, epitomized by the Simpson family, which consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. The show is set in the fictional town of Springfield and parodies American culture and society, television, and the human condition.\nThe family was conceived by Groening shortly before a solicitation for a series of animated shorts with producer James L. Brooks. Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after his own family members, substituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987. After three seasons, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and became Fox's first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season (1989\u201390).\nSince its debut on December 17, 1989, 676 episodes of The Simpsons have been broadcast. It is the longest-running American sitcom, and the longest-running American scripted primetime television series, both in terms of seasons and number of episodes. The Simpsons Movie, a feature-length film, was released in theaters worldwide on July 27, 2007, and grossed over $527 million. Then on October 30, 2007, a video game was released. The Simpsons was renewed on February 6, 2019 for a thirty-first and thirty-second season. The former began airing September 29, 2019 and will conclude in March, 2020, and the latter of which will contain the 700th episode. The Simpsons is a joint production by Gracie Films and 20th Century Fox Television and syndicated by 20th Television.The Simpsons received acclaim throughout its first nine or ten seasons, which are generally considered its ""Golden Age"".

On January 14, 2000, the Simpson family was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It has won dozens of awards since it debuted as a series, including 34 Primetime Emmy Awards, 34 Annie Awards, and a Peabody Award. Homer's exclamatory catchphrase ""D'oh!"" has been adopted into the English language, while The Simpsons has influenced many other later adult-oriented animated sitcoms.

He served for most of his career as professor of psychiatry at the State University of New York Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, New York. A distinguished lifetime fellow of the American Psychiatric Association and a life member of the American Psychoanalytic Association, he was best known as a social critic of the moral and scientific foundations of psychiatry, as what he saw as the social control aims of medicine in modern society, as well as scientism. His books The Myth of Mental Illness (1961) and The Manufacture of Madness (1970) set out some of the arguments most associated with him.\nSzasz argued throughout his career that mental illness is a metaphor for human problems in living, and that mental illnesses are not ""illnesses"" in the sense that physical illnesses are; and that except for a few identifiable brain diseases, there are ""neither biological or chemical tests nor biopsy or necropsy findings for verifying DSM diagnoses.""Szasz maintained throughout his career that he was not anti-psychiatry but was rather anti-coercive psychiatry. He was a staunch opponent of civil commitment and involuntary psychiatric treatment but believed in, and practiced, psychiatry and psychotherapy between consenting adults.\nHis views on special treatment followed from libertarian roots, based on the principles that each person has the right to bodily and mental self-ownership and the right to be free from violence from others, and he criticized the ""Free World"" as well as the communist states for their use of psychiatry.","wikipedia","5.3"
"3.680","Three Gorges Dam","","The Three Gorges Dam is a hydroelectric gravity dam that spans the Yangtze River by the town of Sandouping, in Yiling District, Yichang, Hubei province, China. The Three Gorges Dam has been the world's largest power station in terms of installed capacity (22,500 MW) since 2012. In 2018, the dam generated 101.6 terawatt-hours (TWh), breaking its previous record, but was still slightly lower than the Itaip\u00fa Dam, which had set the world record in 2016 after producing 103.1 TWh.The dam body was completed in 2006. The power plant of the dam project was completed and fully functional as of July 4, 2012, when the last of the main water turbines in the underground plant began production. Each main water turbine has a capacity of 700 MW. Coupling the dam's 32 main turbines with two smaller generators (50 MW each) to power the plant itself, the total electric generating capacity of the dam is 22,500 MW.The last major component of the project, the ship lift, was complete in December 2015.As well as producing electricity, the dam is intended to increase the Yangtze River's shipping capacity. By providing flood storage space, the dam reduces the potential for floods downstream which could possibly affect millions. China regards the project as monumental as well as a success socially and economically, with the design of state-of-the-art large turbines, and a move toward limiting greenhouse gas emissions. However, the dam flooded archaeological and cultural sites, displaced some 1.3 million people, and had caused significant ecological changes including an increased risk of landslides. The dam has been controversial both domestically and abroad.","wikipedia","5.9"
"3.681","Tiananmen Square protests of 1989","","The Tiananmen Square protests or Tiananmen Square Incident, commonly known in mainland China as the June Fourth Incident (Chinese: \u516d\u56db\u4e8b\u4ef6; pinyin: li\u00f9s\u00ec sh\u00ecji\u00e0n, literally six-four incident), were student-led demonstrations held in Tiananmen Square in Beijing during 1989. The popular national movement inspired by the Beijing protests is sometimes called the '89 Democracy Movement (Chinese: \u516b\u4e5d\u6c11\u8fd0; pinyin: b\u0101ji\u01d4 m\u00edny\u00f9n). The protests started on April 15 and were forcibly suppressed on June 4 when the government declared martial law and sent the military to occupy central parts of Beijing. In what became known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre (Chinese: \u5929\u5b89\u95e8\u5927\u5c60\u6740; pinyin: ti\u0101n'\u0101nm\u00e9n d\u00e0 t\u00fash\u0101), troops with assault rifles and tanks fired at the demonstrators and those trying to block the military's advance into Tiananmen Square. Estimates of the death toll vary from several hundred to several thousand, with thousands more wounded.Set off by the death of pro-reform Communist general secretary Hu Yaobang in April 1989, amid the backdrop of rapid economic development and social changes in post-Mao China, the protests reflected anxieties about the country's future in the popular consciousness and among the political elite. The reforms of the 1980s had led to a nascent market economy which benefited some people but seriously disaffected others, and the one-party political system also faced a challenge of legitimacy. Common grievances at the time included inflation, corruption, limited preparedness of graduates for the new economy, and restrictions on political participation. The students called for greater accountability, constitutional due process, democracy, freedom of the press, and freedom of speech, although they were highly disorganized and their goals varied. At the height of the protests, about 1 million people assembled in the Square.As the protests developed, the authorities responded with both conciliatory and hardline tactics, exposing deep divisions within the party leadership. By May, a student-led hunger strike galvanized support for the demonstrators around the country, and the protests spread to some 400 cities. Ultimately, China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping and other Communist Party elders believed the protests to be a political threat and resolved to use force. The State Council declared martial law on May 20 and mobilized as many as 300,000 troops to Beijing. The troops advanced into central parts of Beijing on the city's major thoroughfares in the early morning hours of June 4, killing both demonstrators and bystanders in the process.\nThe international community, human rights organizations, and political analysts condemned the Chinese government for the massacre. Western countries imposed arms embargoes on China. The Chinese government made widespread arrests of protesters and their supporters, suppressed other protests around China, expelled foreign journalists, strictly controlled coverage of the events in the domestic press, strengthened the police and internal security forces, and demoted or purged officials it deemed sympathetic to the protests. More broadly, the suppression halted the policies of liberalization in the 1980s. Considered a watershed event, the protests set the limits on political expression in China up to the present day. Its memory is widely associated with questioning the legitimacy of Communist Party rule and remains one of the most sensitive and most widely censored topics in China.","wikipedia","5.6"

It is the traditional homeland of the Tibetan people as well as some other ethnic groups such as Monpa, Tamang, Qiang, Sherpa, and Lhoba peoples and is now also inhabited by considerable numbers of Han Chinese and Hui people. Tibet is the highest region on Earth, with an average elevation of 5,000 m (16,000 ft). The highest elevation in Tibet is Mount Everest, Earth's highest mountain, rising 8,848 m (29,029 ft) above sea level.\nThe Tibetan Empire emerged in the 7th century, but with the fall of the empire the region soon divided into a variety of territories. The bulk of western and central Tibet (\u00dc-Tsang) was often at least nominally unified under a series of Tibetan governments in Lhasa, Shigatse, or nearby locations. The eastern regions of Kham and Amdo often maintained a more decentralized indigenous political structure, being divided among a number of small principalities and tribal groups, while also often falling more directly under Chinese rule after the Battle of Chamdo; most of this area was eventually incorporated into the Chinese provinces of Sichuan and Qinghai. The current borders of Tibet were generally established in the 18th century.Following the Xinhai Revolution against the Qing dynasty in 1912, Qing soldiers were disarmed and escorted out of Tibet Area (\u00dc-Tsang). The region subsequently declared its independence in 1913 without recognition by the subsequent Chinese Republican government. Later, Lhasa took control of the western part of Xikang, China. The region maintained its autonomy until 1951 when, following the Battle of Chamdo, Tibet became incorporated into the People's Republic of China, and the previous Tibetan government was abolished in 1959 after a failed uprising. Today, China governs western and central Tibet as the Tibet Autonomous Region while the eastern areas are now mostly ethnic autonomous prefectures within Sichuan, Qinghai and other neighbouring provinces. There are tensions regarding Tibet's political status and dissident groups that are active in exile.\nTibetan activists in Tibet have reportedly been arrested or tortured.The economy of Tibet is dominated by subsistence agriculture, though tourism has become a growing industry in recent decades. The dominant religion in Tibet is Tibetan Buddhism; in addition there is B\u00f6n, which is similar to Tibetan Buddhism, and there are also Tibetan Muslims and Christian minorities. Tibetan Buddhism is a primary influence on the art, music, and festivals of the region. Tibetan architecture reflects Chinese and Indian influences. Staple foods in Tibet are roasted barley, yak meat, and butter tea.\n\n","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.683","Time Warner","","WarnerMedia, LLC is an American multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate owned by AT&T and headquartered in New York City. It was originally formed in 1990 as Time Warner, from the merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications. The company has film, television and cable operations, with its assets including WarnerMedia Entertainment (consisting of the entertainment assets of Turner, HBO, Otter Media, and Cinemax, as well as HBO Max streaming service), WarnerMedia News & Sports (consisting of the news and sports assets of Turner, as well as AT&T SportsNet), and Warner Bros. (consisting of the film, animation, and television studios, DC Comics, New Line Cinema, the family-friendly assets of Turner, and with ViacomCBS, a 50% interest in The CW television network).\nOn October 22, 2016, AT&T announced an offer to acquire Time Warner for $108.7 billion (including assumed Time Warner debt). The proposed merger was confirmed on June 12, 2018, after AT&T won an antitrust lawsuit that the U.S. Justice Department filed in 2017 to attempt to block the acquisition. The merger closed two days later, with the company becoming a subsidiary of AT&T.Despite spinning off Time Inc. in 2014, the company retained the Time Warner name until AT&T's acquisition in 2018, after which it became WarnerMedia. The company's previous assets included Time Inc., TW Telecom, AOL, Time Warner Cable, Warner Books, and Warner Music Group; these operations were either sold to others or spun off as independent companies. The company was ranked No. 98 in the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.","wikipedia","5.13"
"3.684","Tobin tax","","A Tobin tax was originally defined as a tax on all spot conversions of one currency into another. It was suggested by James Tobin, an economist who won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. Tobin's tax was originally intended to penalize short-term financial round-trip excursions into another currency.  By the late 1990s, however, the term Tobin tax was being incorrectly used to apply to all forms of short term transaction taxation, whether across currencies or not. Another term for these broader tax schemes is Robin Hood tax, due to tax revenues from the (presumably richer) speculator funding general revenue (of whom the primary beneficiaries are less wealthy).  More exact terms, however, apply to different scopes of tax.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.685","Torture","","Torture (from Latin tortus: to twist, to torment) is the act of deliberately inflicting severe physical or psychological suffering on someone by another as a punishment or in order to fulfill some desire of the torturer or force some action from the victim. (Not to be confused with abuse, a form of  forcing action) Torture, by definition, is a knowing and intentional act; deeds which unknowingly or negligently inflict suffering or pain, without a specific intent to do so, are not typically considered torture.Torture has been carried out or sanctioned by individuals, groups, and states throughout history from ancient times to modern day, and forms of torture can vary greatly in duration from only a few minutes to several days or longer. Reasons for torture can include punishment, revenge, extortion, persuasion, political re-education, deterrence, coercion of the victim or a third party, interrogation to extract information or a confession irrespective of whether it is false, or simply the sadistic gratification of those carrying out or observing the torture. Alternatively, some forms of torture are designed to inflict psychological pain or leave as little physical injury or evidence as possible while achieving the same psychological devastation. The torturer may or may not kill or injure the victim, but torture may result in a deliberate death and serves as a form of capital punishment. Depending on the aim, even a form of torture that is intentionally fatal may be prolonged to allow the victim to suffer as long as possible (such as half-hanging). In other cases, the torturer may be indifferent to the condition of the victim.\nAlthough torture is sanctioned by some states, it is prohibited under international law and the domestic laws of most countries. Although widely illegal and reviled, there is an ongoing debate as to what exactly is and is not legally defined as torture. It is a serious violation of human rights, and is declared to be unacceptable (but not illegal) by Article 5 of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Signatories of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the Additional Protocols I and II of 8 June 1977 officially agree not to torture captured persons in armed conflicts, whether international or internal. Torture is also prohibited for the signatories of the United Nations Convention Against Torture, which has 163 state parties.National and international legal prohibitions on torture derive from a consensus that torture and similar ill-treatment are immoral, as well as impractical, and information obtained by torture is far less reliable than that obtained by other techniques. Despite these findings and international conventions, organizations that monitor abuses of human rights (e.g., Amnesty International, the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims, Freedom from Torture, etc.) report widespread use condoned by states in many regions of the world. Amnesty International estimates that at least 81 world governments currently practice torture, some of them openly.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.686","Toxic waste","","Toxic waste is any unwanted material in all forms that can cause harm (e.g. by being inhaled, swallowed, or absorbed through the skin). Many of today's household products such as televisions, computers and phones contain toxic chemicals that can pollute the air and contaminate soil and water. Disposing of such waste is a major public health issue.","wikipedia","5.9"
"3.687","Trail of Tears","","The Trail of Tears was a series of forced relocations of approximately 60,000 Native Americans in the United States from their ancestral homelands in the Southeastern United States, to areas to the west of the Mississippi River that had been designated as Indian Territory. The forced relocations were carried out by government authorities following the passage of the Indian Removal Act in 1830. The relocated peoples suffered from exposure, disease, and starvation while en route to their new designated reserve, and approximately 4,000 died before reaching their destinations or shortly after from disease. The forced removals included members of the Cherokee, Muscogee (Creek), Seminole, Chickasaw, and Choctaw nations, as well as their African slaves. The phrase ""Trail of Tears"" originates from a description of the removal of many Native American tribes, including the Cherokee Nation relocation in 1838.Between 1830 and 1850, the Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, Seminole, and Cherokee people (including mixed-race and black slaves who lived among them) were forcibly removed from their traditional lands in the Southeastern United States, and later relocated farther west. State and local militias forced Native Americans who were relocated to march to their destinations. The Cherokee removal in 1838 (the last forced removal east of the Mississippi) was brought on by the discovery of gold near Dahlonega, Georgia in 1828, resulting in the Georgia Gold Rush. Approximately 2,000\u20138,000 of the 16,543 relocated Cherokee perished along the way.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.688","Transgender","","Transgender people have a gender identity or gender expression that differs from their sex assigned at birth. Some transgender people who desire medical assistance to transition from one sex to another identify as transsexual. Transgender, often shortened as trans, is also an umbrella term: in addition to including people whose gender identity is the opposite of their assigned sex (trans men and trans women), it may include people who are not exclusively masculine or feminine (people who are non-binary or genderqueer, including bigender, pangender, genderfluid, or agender). Other definitions of transgender also include people who belong to a third gender, or else conceptualize transgender people as a third gender. The term transgender may be defined very broadly to include cross-dressers.Being transgender is independent of sexual orientation. Transgender people may identify as heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, asexual, or may decline to label their sexual orientation. The term transgender is also distinguished from intersex, a term that describes people born with physical sex characteristics ""that do not fit typical binary notions of male or female bodies"". The opposite of transgender is cisgender, which describes persons whose gender identity or expression matches their assigned sex.The degree to which individuals feel genuine, authentic, and comfortable within their external appearance and accept their genuine identity has been called transgender congruence. Many transgender people experience gender dysphoria, and some seek medical treatments such as hormone replacement therapy, sex reassignment surgery, or psychotherapy. Not all transgender people desire these treatments, and some cannot undergo them for financial or medical reasons.Many transgender people face discrimination in the workplace and in accessing public accommodations and healthcare. In many places, they are not legally protected from discrimination.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.689","Transsexual","","Transsexual people experience a gender identity that is inconsistent with, or not culturally associated with, their assigned sex and desire to permanently transition to the gender with which they identify, usually seeking medical assistance (including hormone replacement therapy and other sex reassignment therapies) to help them align their body with their identified sex or gender.\nTranssexual is a subset of transgender, but some transsexual people reject the label of transgender. A medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria can be made if a person expresses a desire to live and be accepted as a member of their identified sex and if a person experiences impaired functioning or distress as a result of their gender identity.","wikipedia","5.7"

"3.691","Truth","","Truth is most often used to mean being in accord with fact or reality, or fidelity to an original or standard. Truth is also sometimes defined in modern contexts as an idea of ""truth to self"", or authenticity.\nTruth is usually held to be opposite to falsehood, which, correspondingly, can also suggest a logical, factual, or ethical meaning. The concept of truth is discussed and debated in several contexts, including philosophy, art, theology, and science. Most human activities depend upon the concept, where its nature as a concept is assumed rather than being a subject of discussion; these include most of the sciences, law, journalism, and everyday life. Some philosophers view the concept of truth as basic, and unable to be explained in any terms that are more easily understood than the concept of truth itself. To some, truth is viewed as the correspondence of language or thought to an independent reality, in what is sometimes called the correspondence theory of truth.\nVarious theories and views of truth continue to be debated among scholars, philosophers, and theologians. Language is a means by which humans convey information to one another. The method used to determine whether something is a truth is termed a criterion of truth. There are varying stances on such questions as what constitutes truth: what things are truthbearers capable of being true or false; how to define, identify, and distinguish truth; what roles do faith and empirical knowledge play; and whether truth can be subjective or if it is objective (in other words, relative truth versus absolute truth).","wikipedia","5.2"
"3.692","Turanism","","Turanism, also known as pan-Turanianism or pan-Turanism, is a nationalist cultural and political movement born in the 19th century to counter the effects of pan-nationalist ideologies pan-Germanism and pan-Slavism. It proclaimed the need for close cooperation between or an alliance with culturally, linguistically or ethnically related peoples of Inner and Central Asian origin like the Finns, Japanese, Koreans, Sami, Samoyeds, Hungarians, Turks, Mongols, Manchus and other smaller ethnic groups as a means of securing and furthering shared interests and countering the threats posed by the policies of the great powers of Europe. The idea of a ""Turanian brotherhood and collaboration"" was borrowed from the pan-Slavic concept of ""Slavic brotherhood and collaboration"".The term itself originates from the name of a geographical area, the Turan Depression. The term Turan was widely used in scientific literature from the 18th century onwards to denote Central Asia. European scholars borrowed the term from the historical works of Abu al-Ghazi Bahadur; the annotated English translation of his Shajare-i T\u00fcrk was published in 1729 and quickly became an oft used source for European scholars.\nThis political ideology originated in the work of the Finnish nationalist and linguist Matthias Alexander Castr\u00e9n, who championed the ideology of pan-Turanism\u2014the belief in the racial unity and the future greatness of the Ural-Altaic peoples. He concluded that the Finns originated in Central Asia (more specifically in the Altai Mountains) and far from being a small isolated people, they were part of a larger polity that included such peoples as the Magyars, Turks, Mongols and the like. It implies not only the unity of all Turkic peoples (as in pan-Turkism), but also the alliance of a wider Turanian or Ural-Altaic family believed to include all peoples speaking ""Turanian languages"".\nAlthough Turanism is a political movement for the union of all Uralo-Altaic peoples, there are different opinions about inclusiveness. In the opinion of the famous Turanist Ziya G\u00f6kalp, Turanism is for Turkic peoples only as the other Turanian peoples (Finns, Hungarians, Mongolians and so on) are too different culturally, thus he narrowed Turanism into pan-Turkism.

"3.660","TWA Flight 800","","Trans World Airlines Flight 800 (TWA 800) was a Boeing 747-100 that exploded and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean near East Moriches, New York, on July 17, 1996, at about 8:31 p.m. EDT, 12 minutes after takeoff from John F. Kennedy International Airport on a scheduled international passenger flight to Rome, with a stopover in Paris. All 230 people on board died in the crash; it is the third-deadliest aviation accident in U.S. history.\nAccident investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) traveled to the scene, arriving the following morning amid speculation that a terrorist attack was the cause of the crash. Consequently, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and New York Police Department Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) initiated a parallel criminal investigation. Sixteen months later, the JTTF announced that no evidence of a criminal act had been found  and closed its active investigation.The four-year NTSB investigation concluded with the approval of the Aircraft Accident Report on August 23, 2000, ending the most extensive, complex and costly air disaster investigation in U.S. history to that time. The report's conclusion was that the probable cause of the accident was explosion of flammable fuel vapors in the center fuel tank. Although it could not be determined with certainty, the likely ignition source was a short circuit. Problems with the aircraft's wiring were found, including evidence of arcing in the Fuel Quantity Indication System (FQIS) wiring that enters the tank. The FQIS on Flight 800 is known to have been malfunctioning; the captain remarked on what he called ""crazy"" readings from the system approximately two minutes and thirty seconds before the aircraft exploded. As a result of the investigation, new requirements were developed for aircraft to prevent future fuel tank explosions.\n\n","wikipedia","5.6"

"3.694","Twin paradox","","In physics, the twin paradox is a thought experiment in special relativity involving identical twins, one of whom makes a journey into space in a high-speed rocket and returns home to find that the twin who remained on Earth has aged more. This result appears puzzling because each twin sees the other twin as moving, and so, according to an incorrect and naive application of time dilation and the principle of relativity, each should paradoxically find the other to have aged less. However, this scenario can be resolved within the standard framework of special relativity: the travelling twin's trajectory involves two different inertial frames, one for the outbound journey and one for the inbound journey, and so there is no symmetry between the spacetime paths of the twins. Therefore, the twin paradox is not a paradox in the sense of a logical contradiction. \nStarting with Paul Langevin in 1911, there have been various explanations of this paradox. These explanations ""can be grouped into those that focus on the effect of different standards of simultaneity in different frames, and those that designate the acceleration [experienced by the travelling twin] as the main reason"". Max von Laue argued in 1913 that since the traveling twin must be in two separate inertial frames, one on the way out and another on the way back, this frame switch is the reason for the aging difference, not the acceleration per se. Explanations put forth by Albert Einstein and Max Born invoked gravitational time dilation to explain the aging as a direct effect of acceleration. General relativity is not necessary to explain the twin paradox; special relativity alone can explain the phenomenon.Time dilation has been verified experimentally by precise measurements of atomic clocks flown in aircraft and satellites. For example, gravitational time dilation and special relativity together have been used to explain the Hafele\u2013Keating experiment. It was also confirmed in particle accelerators by measuring the time dilation of circulating particle beams.","wikipedia","5.8"

"3.699","United Nations","","The United Nations (UN) is an intergovernmental organization that aims to maintain international peace and security, develop friendly relations among nations, achieve international cooperation, and be a center for harmonizing the actions of nations. It is the largest, most familiar, most internationally represented and most powerful intergovernmental organization in the world. The UN is headquartered on international territory in New York City; other main offices are in Geneva, Nairobi, Vienna and The Hague.\nThe UN was established after World War II with the aim of preventing future wars, succeeding the ineffective League of Nations. On 25 April 1945, 50 governments met in San Francisco for a conference and started drafting the UN Charter, which was adopted on 25 June 1945 and took effect on 24 October 1945, when the UN began operations. Pursuant to the Charter, the organization's objectives include maintaining international peace and security, protecting human rights, delivering humanitarian aid, promoting sustainable development, and upholding international law. At its founding, the UN had 51 member states; this number grew to 193 in 2011, representing the vast majority of the world's sovereign states.\nThe organization's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union and their respective allies. Its missions have consisted primarily of unarmed military observers and lightly armed troops with primarily monitoring, reporting and confidence-building roles. UN membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization beginning in the 1960s. Since then, 80 former colonies have gained independence, including 11 trust territories that had been monitored by the Trusteeship Council. By the 1970s, the UN's budget for economic and social development programmes far outstripped its spending on peacekeeping. After the end of the Cold War, the UN shifted and expanded its field operations, undertaking a wide variety of complex tasks.The UN has six principal organs: the General Assembly; the Security Council; the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC); the Trusteeship Council; the International Court of Justice; and the UN Secretariat. The UN System includes a multitude of specialized agencies, such as the World Bank Group, the World Health Organization, the World Food Programme, UNESCO, and UNICEF. Additionally, non-governmental organizations may be granted consultative status with ECOSOC and other agencies to participate in the UN's work. The UN's chief administrative officer is the Secretary-General, currently Portuguese politician and diplomat Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, since 1 January 2017. The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states.\nThe UN, its officers, and its agencies have won many Nobel Peace Prizes, though other evaluations of its effectiveness have been mixed. Some commentators believe the organization to be an important force for peace and human development, while others have called it ineffective, biased, or corrupt.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.700","United States presidential election, 2000","","The 2000 United States presidential election was the 54th quadrennial presidential election. It was held on Tuesday, November 7, 2000. Republican candidate George W. Bush, the governor of Texas and eldest son of the 41st president, George H. W. Bush, won the election, defeating Democratic nominee Al Gore, the incumbent vice president. It was the fourth of five presidential elections in which the winning candidate lost the popular vote, and is considered one of the closest elections in US history.Gore secured the Democratic nomination with relative ease, defeating a challenge by former Senator Bill Bradley. Bush was seen as the early favorite for the Republican nomination and, despite a contentious primary battle with Senator John McCain and others, secured the nomination by Super Tuesday. Bush chose former Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney as his running mate, while Gore chose Senator Joe Lieberman. The left-wing Green Party nominated political activists Ralph Nader and Winona LaDuke.\nBoth major-party candidates focused primarily on domestic issues, such as the budget, tax relief, and reforms for federal social insurance programs, although foreign policy was not ignored. Due to President Bill Clinton's sex scandal with Monica Lewinsky and subsequent impeachment, Gore avoided campaigning with Clinton. Republicans denounced Clinton's indiscretions, while Gore criticized Bush's lack of experience. On election night, it was unclear who had won, with the electoral votes of the state of Florida still undecided. The returns showed that Bush had won Florida by such a close margin that state law required a recount. A monthlong series of legal battles led to the highly controversial 5\u20134 Supreme Court decision Bush v. Gore, which ended the recount.\nWith the end of the recount, Bush won Florida by a margin of 0.009%, or 537 votes. The Florida recount and subsequent litigation resulted in major post-election controversy, and various people and organizations have speculated about who would have won the election in various scenarios. Ultimately, Bush won 271 electoral votes, one more than a majority, despite Gore receiving 543,895 more votes (a margin of 0.51% of all votes cast). Bush flipped 11 states that went Democratic in the 1996 election: Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio, Tennessee and West Virginia. Some of the Southern and Midwestern states flipped in this election have since become safe states in presidential elections for the Republican Party.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.701","United States presidential election, 2016","","The 2016 United States presidential election was the 58th quadrennial presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 8, 2016. The Republican ticket of businessman Donald Trump and Indiana Governor Mike Pence defeated the Democratic ticket of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and U.S. Senator from Virginia Tim Kaine, despite losing the popular vote. Trump took office as the 45th president, and Pence as the 48th vice president, on January 20, 2017.\nTrump emerged as his party's front-runner amidst a wide field of Republican primary candidates, while Clinton defeated Senator Bernie Sanders and became the first female presidential nominee of a major American party. Trump's populist, nationalist campaign, which promised to ""Make America Great Again"" and opposed political correctness, illegal immigration, and many free-trade agreements, garnered extensive free media coverage. Clinton emphasized her extensive political experience, denounced Trump and many of his supporters as bigots, and advocated the expansion of President Obama's policies; racial, LGBT, and women's rights; and ""inclusive capitalism"". The tone of the general election campaign was widely characterized as divisive and negative. Trump faced controversy over his views on race and immigration, incidents of violence against protestors at his rallies, and numerous sexual misconduct allegations including a controversial tape, while Clinton's campaign was undermined by declining approval ratings due to concerns about her ethics and trustworthiness, and an FBI investigation of her improper use of a private email server, which received more media coverage than any other topic during the campaign.Clinton led in nearly every pre-election nationwide poll and in most swing state polls, leading some commentators to compare Trump's victory to that of Harry S. Truman in 1948 as one of the greatest political upsets in modern U.S. history. While Clinton received 2.87 million more votes than Trump did (the largest margin ever for a losing presidential candidate), Trump received the majority in the Electoral College and won upset victories in the pivotal Rust Belt region. Trump won six states that Democrat Barack Obama had won in 2012: Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Ultimately, Trump received 304 electoral votes and Clinton 227, as two faithless electors defected from Trump and five defected from Clinton. Trump is the fifth person in U.S. history to become president while losing the nationwide popular vote. He is the first president with neither prior public service nor military experience, and the oldest person to be inaugurated for a first presidential term.\nThe United States government's intelligence agencies concluded on January 6, 2017, that the Russian government had interfered in the 2016 elections in order to ""undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency"". A Special Counsel investigation of alleged collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign began in May 2017 and ended in March 2019. The investigation concluded that Russian interference to favor Trump's candidacy occurred ""in sweeping and systematic fashion"", but ""did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government"". It did, however, find that members of the campaign had communicated with people connected to Russian intelligence.\n\n","wikipedia","5.6"

Quranists believe that God's message in the Quran is clear and complete as it is, and that it can therefore be fully understood without referencing the hadith. Quranists affirm that the hadith literature which exists today is apocryphal, as it had been written three centuries after the death of the Islamic prophet Muhammad; thus, it cannot have the same status as the Quran. \nIn matters of faith, jurisprudence, and legislation, Quranists differ from ahl al-Hadith, which today comprises the Sunnis, and to some limited extent, the Ibadis and Shias, and which first emerged during the 2nd/3rd Islamic centuries of the Islamic era (late 8th and 9th century CE) as a movement of Hadith scholars who considered the Quran and Hadith to be the only legislative authority in matters of law and creed.Quran alone-Islam is similar to movements in Abrahamic religions such as the Karaite movement in Judaism and the Sola scriptura view of Protestant Christianity.","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.704","Universal health care","","Universal healthcare (also called universal health coverage, universal coverage, or universal care) is a health care system in which all residents of a particular country or region are assured access to health care. It is generally organized around providing either all residents or only those who cannot afford on their own with either health services or the means to acquire them, with the end goal of improving health outcomes.Universal healthcare does not imply coverage for all people for everything, only that all people have access to healthcare. Some universal healthcare systems are government funded, while others are based on a requirement that all citizens purchase private health insurance. Universal healthcare can be determined by three critical dimensions: who is covered, what services are covered, and how much of the cost is covered. It is described by the World Health Organization as a situation where citizens can access health services without incurring financial hardship. The Director General of WHO describes universal health coverage as the \u201csingle most powerful concept that public health has to offer\u201d since it unifies \u201cservices and delivers them in a comprehensive and integrated way\u201d. One of the goals with universal healthcare is to create a system of protection which provides equality of opportunity for people to enjoy the highest possible level of health.As part of Sustainable Development Goals, United Nations member states have agreed to work toward worldwide universal health coverage by 2030.\n\n","wikipedia","5.5"

The ULC has ordained ministers from a wide range of backgrounds and beliefs, including Christians, atheists, Wiccans and pagans, and people of many other faiths. The ULC's popularity stems in part from a rising interest in having friends or loved ones host weddings, a trend which has attracted a range of celebrities to become ordained including Adele, Benedict Cumberbatch, Ian McKellen, Conan O\u2019Brien and Steven Tyler, among others. However, four U.S. states have held that they will not recognize marriages solemnized by ULC ministers, while eight states have specifically held such marriages to be valid, these being Alabama, Illinois, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, and Washington. The remainder have not addressed the issue.","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.706","Universe","","The Universe (Latin: universus) is all of space and time and their contents, including planets, stars, galaxies, and all other forms of matter and energy. While the spatial size of the entire Universe is unknown, it is possible to measure the size of the observable universe, which is currently estimated to be 93 billion light-years in diameter. In various multiverse hypotheses, a universe is one of many causally disconnected constituent parts of a larger multiverse, which itself comprises all of space and time and its contents; as a consequence, \u2018the Universe\u2019 and \u2018the multiverse\u2019 are synonymous in such theories.\nThe earliest cosmological models of the Universe were developed by ancient Greek and Indian philosophers and were geocentric, placing Earth at the center. Over the centuries, more precise astronomical observations led Nicolaus Copernicus to develop the heliocentric model with the Sun at the center of the Solar System. In developing the law of universal gravitation, Isaac Newton built upon Copernicus' work as well as Johannes Kepler's laws of planetary motion and observations by Tycho Brahe.\nFurther observational improvements led to the realization that the Sun is one of hundreds of billions of stars in the Milky Way, which is one of at least hundreds of billions of galaxies in the Universe. Many of the stars in our galaxy have planets. At the largest scale, galaxies are distributed uniformly and the same in all directions, meaning that the Universe has neither an edge nor a center. At smaller scales, galaxies are distributed in clusters and superclusters which form immense filaments and voids in space, creating a vast foam-like structure. Discoveries in the early 20th century have suggested that the Universe had a beginning and that space has been expanding since then, and is currently still expanding at an increasing rate.The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological description of the development of the Universe. Under this theory, space and time emerged together 13.799\u00b10.021 billion years ago and the energy and matter initially present have become less dense as the Universe expanded. After an initial accelerated expansion called the inflationary epoch at around 10\u221232 seconds, and the separation of the four known fundamental forces, the Universe gradually cooled and continued to expand, allowing the first subatomic particles and simple atoms to form. Dark matter gradually gathered, forming a foam-like structure of filaments and voids under the influence of gravity. Giant clouds of hydrogen and helium were gradually drawn to the places where dark matter was most dense, forming the first galaxies, stars, and everything else seen today. It is possible to see objects that are now further away than 13.799 billion light-years because space itself has expanded, and it is still expanding today. This means that objects which are now up to 46.5 billion light-years away can still be seen in their distant past, because in the past, when their light was emitted, they were much closer to Earth.\nFrom studying the movement of galaxies, it has been discovered that the universe contains much more matter than is accounted for by visible objects; stars, galaxies, nebulas and interstellar gas. This unseen matter is known as dark matter (dark means that there is a wide range of strong indirect evidence that it exists, but we have not yet detected it directly). The \u039bCDM model is the most widely accepted model of our universe. It suggests that about 69.2%\u00b11.2% [2015] of the mass and energy in the universe is a cosmological constant (or, in extensions to \u039bCDM, other forms of dark energy, such as a scalar field) which is responsible for the current expansion of space, and about 25.8%\u00b11.1% [2015] is dark matter. Ordinary ('baryonic') matter is therefore only 4.84%\u00b10.1% [2015] of the physical universe. Stars, planets, and visible gas clouds only form about 6% of ordinary matter, or about 0.29% of the entire universe.There are many competing hypotheses about the ultimate fate of the universe and about what, if anything, preceded the Big Bang, while other physicists and philosophers refuse to speculate, doubting that information about prior states will ever be accessible. Some physicists have suggested various multiverse hypotheses, in which our universe might be one among many universes that likewise exist.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.707","Unmanned combat air vehicle","","An unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV), also known as a combat drone or simply a drone, is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that usually carries aircraft ordnance such as missiles, ATGMs, and/or bombs and is used for drone strikes. These drones are usually under real-time human control, with varying levels of autonomy. Aircraft of this type have no onboard human pilot. As the operator runs the vehicle from a remote terminal,  equipment necessary for a human pilot is not needed, resulting in a lower weight and a smaller size than a manned aircraft. China, Israel, Turkey and the United States are widely recognized as industry leaders in UCAV technology. Several other countries have operational domestic UCAVs and many more have imported armed drones or have development programs underway.","wikipedia","5.4"
"3.697","USA PATRIOT Act","","The USA PATRIOT Act (commonly known as the Patriot Act) is an Act of the United States Congress that was signed into law by U.S. President George W. Bush on October 26, 2001. The title of the Act is a contrived three letter initialism (USA) preceding a seven letter acronym (PATRIOT), which in combination stand for Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001. The acronym was created by 23-year-old Congressional staffer Chris Cylke.\nIn response to the September 11 attacks and the 2001 anthrax attacks, Congress passed legislation to strengthen national security. On October 23, 2001, Republican Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner introduced H.R. 3162 incorporating provisions from a previously-sponsored House bill and a Senate bill also introduced earlier in the month. The next day, the Act passed the House by a vote of 357\u201366, with Democrats comprising the overwhelming portion of dissent. The three Republicans voting ""no"" were Robert Ney of Ohio, Butch Otter of Idaho, and Ron Paul of Texas. On October 25, the Act passed the Senate by a 98\u20131 vote, the only dissident being Russ Feingold of Wisconsin.Those opposing the law have criticized its authorization of indefinite detentions of immigrants; the permission given to law enforcement to search a home or business without the owner's or the occupant's consent or knowledge; the expanded use of National Security Letters, which allows the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to search telephone, e-mail, and financial records without a court order; and the expanded access of law enforcement agencies to business records, including library and financial records. Since its passage, several legal challenges have been brought against the act, and federal courts have ruled that a number of provisions are unconstitutional.\nMany of the act's provisions were to sunset beginning December 31, 2005, approximately four years after its passage. In the months preceding the sunset date, supporters of the act pushed to make its sun-setting provisions permanent, while critics sought to revise various sections to enhance civil liberty protections. In July 2005, the U.S. Senate passed a reauthorization bill with substantial changes to several of the act's sections, while the House reauthorization bill kept most of the act's original language. The two bills were then reconciled in a conference committee criticized by Senators from both the Republican and Democratic parties for ignoring civil liberty concerns.The bill, which removed most of the changes from the Senate version, passed Congress on March 2, 2006, and was signed by President Bush on March 9 and 10 of that year.\nOn May 26, 2011, President Barack Obama signed the PATRIOT Sunsets Extension Act of 2011, a four-year extension of three key provisions in the Act: roving wiretaps, searches of business records, and conducting surveillance of ""lone wolves""\u2014individuals suspected of terrorist-related activities not linked to terrorist groups.Following a lack of Congressional approval, parts of the Patriot Act expired on June 1, 2015. With passing the USA Freedom Act on June 2, 2015, the expired parts were restored and renewed through 2019. However, Section 215 of the law was amended to stop the National Security Agency (NSA) from continuing its mass phone data collection program. Instead, phone companies will retain the data and the NSA can obtain information about targeted individuals with permission from a federal court.\n\n","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.696","U.S. Civil War","","The American Civil War (also known by other names) was a civil war in the United States from 1861 to 1865, fought between the northern United States (loyal to the Union) and the southern United States (that had seceded from the Union and formed the Confederacy). The civil war began primarily as a result of the long-standing controversy over the enslavement of black people. War broke out in April 1861 when secessionist forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina shortly after Abraham Lincoln had been inaugurated as the President of the United States. The loyalists of the Union in the North, which also included some geographically western and southern states, proclaimed support for the Constitution. They faced secessionists of the Confederate States in the South, who advocated for states' rights in order to uphold slavery.\nOf the 34 U.S. states in February 1861, seven Southern ""slave states"" were declared by their state governments to have seceded from the country, and the  Confederate States of America was organized in rebellion against the U.S. constitutional government. The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in eleven states, and it claimed the additional states of Kentucky and Missouri by assertions from native secessionists fleeing Union authority. These states were given full representation in the Confederate Congress throughout the Civil War. The two remaining ""slave states"", Delaware and Maryland, were invited to join the Confederacy, but nothing substantial developed due to intervention by federal troops.\nThe Confederate states were never diplomatically recognized as a joint entity by the government of the United States, nor by that of any foreign country. The states that remained loyal to the U.S. were known as the Union. The Union and the Confederacy quickly raised volunteer and conscription armies that fought mostly in the South over the course of four years. Intense combat left 620,000 to 750,000 people dead, more than the number of U.S. military deaths in all other wars combined.The war effectively ended April 9, 1865, when General Robert E. Lee surrendered to General Ulysses S. Grant at the Battle of Appomattox Court House. Confederate generals throughout the southern states followed suit, the last surrender on land occurring June 23. Much of the South's infrastructure was destroyed, especially the transportation systems. The Confederacy collapsed, slavery was abolished, and four million black slaves were freed. During the Reconstruction era that followed the war, national unity was slowly restored, the national government expanded its power, and civil and political rights were granted to freed black slaves through amendments to the Constitution and federal legislation. The war is one of the most studied and written about episodes in U.S. history.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.708","Ustaše","","The Usta\u0161a \u2013 Croatian Revolutionary Movement (Croatian: Usta\u0161a \u2013 Hrvatski revolucionarni pokret), commonly known as Usta\u0161e (pronounced [\u00fbsta\u0283e], Croatian: Usta\u0161e), was a Croatian fascist, ultranationalist and terrorist organization, active, as one organization, between 1929 and 1945. Its members murdered hundreds of thousands of Serbs, Jews, and Roma as well as political dissidents in Yugoslavia during World War II. They were known for their particularly brutal and sadistic methods of execution, which often included torture and dismemberment.Much of the ideology of the Usta\u0161e was based on Nazi racial theory. Like the Nazis, the Usta\u0161e deemed Jews, Romani, and Slavs to be sub-humans (Untermenschen). They endorsed the claims from German racial theorists that Croats were not Slavs but a Germanic race. Their genocides against Serbs, Jews, and Romani were thus expressions of Nazi racial ideology. However, the Usta\u0161e viewed the Bosniaks as ""Muslim Croats,"" not Slavs, and as a result did not persecute Muslim Bosniaks on the basis of race.In addition to Nazi racial theory, the Usta\u0161e ideology incorporated fascism, Roman Catholicism and Croatian nationalism. The Usta\u0161e supported the creation of a Greater Croatia that would span the Drina River and extend to the border of Belgrade. The movement emphasized the need for a racially ""pure"" Croatia and promoted genocide against Serbs, Jews and Romani people, and persecution of anti-fascist or dissident Croats and Bosniaks. \nThey are variously known in English as the Usta\u0161e, Ustashe, Ustashi, Ustahis, or Ustashas; with the associated adjective sometimes being Ustashe or Ustasha, apart from Usta\u0161e. This variance stems from the fact that Usta\u0161e is the plural form of Usta\u0161a in the Serbo-Croatian language.\nFiercely Roman Catholic, the Usta\u0161e espoused Roman Catholicism and Islam as the religions of the Croats and Bosniaks and condemned Orthodox Christianity, which was the main religion of the Serbs. Roman Catholicism was identified with Croatian nationalism, while Islam, which had a large following in Bosnia and Herzegovina, was praised by the Usta\u0161e as the religion that ""keeps true the blood of Croats.""When it was founded in 1930, it was a nationalist organization that sought to create an independent Croatian state. When the Usta\u0161e came to power in the NDH, a quasi-protectorate established by Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany during World War II, its military wings became the Army of the Independent State of Croatia and the Usta\u0161e militia (Croatian: Usta\u0161ka vojnica). However the Ustashe never received massive support from ordinary Croats. The Ustashe regime was backed by parts of the Croatian population that during the interwar period had felt oppressed in  the Serbian-led Yugoslavia. Most of the support it had initially gained by creating a Croat national state was lost because of the brutal practices it used.The movement functioned as a terrorist organization before World War II but in April 1941, they were appointed to rule a part of Axis-occupied Yugoslavia as the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), which has been described as both an Italian-German quasi-protectorate, and as a puppet state of Nazi Germany.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.709","Vaccine controversies","","Vaccine hesitancy, also known as anti-vaccination or anti-vax, is a reluctance or refusal to be vaccinated or to have one's children vaccinated against contagious diseases. It is identified by the World Health Organization as one of the top ten global health threats of 2019. The term encompasses outright refusal to vaccinate, delaying vaccines, accepting vaccines but remaining uncertain about their use, or using certain vaccines but not others. Arguments against vaccination are contradicted by overwhelming scientific consensus about the safety and efficacy of vaccines.Hesitancy primarily results from public debates around the medical, ethical and legal issues related to vaccines. Vaccine hesitancy stems from multiple key factors including a person's lack of confidence (mistrust of the vaccine and/or healthcare provider), complacency (the person does not see a need for the vaccine or does not see the value of the vaccine), and convenience (access to vaccines). It has existed since the invention of vaccination, and pre-dates the coining of the terms ""vaccine"" and ""vaccination"" by nearly 80 years. The specific hypotheses raised by anti-vaccination advocates have been found to change over time. Vaccine hesitancy often results in disease outbreaks and deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases.Bills for mandatory vaccination have been considered for legislation, including California Senate Bill 277 and Australia's No Jab No Pay, all of which have been strenuously opposed by anti-vaccination activists. Opposition to mandatory vaccination may be based on anti-vaccine sentiment, concern that it violates civil liberties or reduces public trust in vaccination, or suspicion of profiteering by the pharmaceutical industry.","wikipedia","5.8"

"3.712","Veganism","","Veganism is the practice of abstaining from the use of animal products, particularly in diet, and an associated philosophy that rejects the commodity status of animals. A follower of the diet or the philosophy is known as a vegan. Distinctions may be made between several categories of veganism. Dietary vegans (also known as ""strict vegetarians"") refrain from consuming meat, eggs, dairy products, and any other animal-derived substances. An ethical vegan (also known as a ""moral vegetarian"") is someone who not only follows a vegan diet but extends the philosophy into other areas of their lives, and opposes the use of animals for any purpose. Another term is ""environmental veganism"", which refers to the avoidance of animal products on the premise that the industrial farming of animals is environmentally damaging and unsustainable.Well-planned vegan diets are regarded as appropriate for all stages of life, including infancy and pregnancy, by the American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, Dietitians of Canada, the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council, New Zealand Ministry of Health, Harvard Medical School, and the British Dietetic Association. The German Society for Nutrition does not recommend vegan diets for children or adolescents, or during pregnancy and breastfeeding. In preliminary clinical research, vegan diets lowered the risk of type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, and ischemic heart disease. Vegan diets tend to be higher in dietary fiber, magnesium, folic acid, vitamin C, vitamin E, iron, and phytochemicals; and lower in dietary energy, saturated fat, cholesterol, long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12. As with a poorly-planned diet of any other variation, an unbalanced vegan diet may lead to nutritional deficiencies that nullify any beneficial effects and may cause serious health issues. Some of these deficiencies can only be prevented through the choice of fortified foods or the regular intake of dietary supplements. Vitamin B12 supplementation is especially important because its deficiency causes blood disorders and potentially irreversible neurological damage.Donald Watson coined the term ""vegan"" in 1944 when he co-founded the Vegan Society in the UK. At first he used it to mean ""non-dairy vegetarian"", and by May 1945 vegans explicitly abstained from ""eggs, honey; and animals' milk, butter and cheese"". From 1951 the Society defined it as ""the doctrine that man should live without exploiting animals"". Interest in veganism increased in the 2010s, especially in the latter half. More vegan stores opened and vegan options became increasingly available in supermarkets and restaurants worldwide.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.713","Video game controversies","","Video game controversies refers to a wide range of debates on the social effects of video games on players and broader society, as well as debates within the video game industry. Since the early 2000s, advocates of video games have emphasized their use as an expressive medium, arguing for their protection under the laws governing freedom of speech and also as an educational tool. Detractors argue that video games are harmful and therefore should be subject to legislative oversight and restrictions. The positive and negative characteristics and effects of video games are the subject of scientific study. Academic research has examined the links between video games and addiction, aggression, violence, social development, and a variety of stereotyping and sexual morality issues.\n\n","wikipedia","5.12"
"3.714","Vietnam War","","The Vietnam War (Vietnamese: Chi\u1ebfn tranh Vi\u1ec7t Nam), also known as the Second Indochina War, and in Vietnam as the Resistance War Against America (Vietnamese: Kh\u00e1ng chi\u1ebfn ch\u1ed1ng M\u1ef9) or simply the American War, was a conflict in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia from 1 November 1955 to the fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975. It was the second of the Indochina Wars and was officially fought between North Vietnam and South Vietnam. North Vietnam was supported by the Soviet Union, China, and other communist allies; South Vietnam was supported by the United States, South Korea, the Philippines, Australia, Thailand and other anti-communist allies. The war, considered a Cold War-era proxy war by some, lasted 19 years, with direct U.S. involvement ending in 1973, and included the Laotian Civil War and the Cambodian Civil War, which ended with all three countries becoming communist in 1975.\nThe conflict emerged from the First Indochina War against the communist-led Viet Minh. Most of the funding for the French war effort was provided by the U.S. After the French quit Indochina in 1954, the US assumed financial and military support for the South Vietnamese state. The Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng, also known as Front national de lib\u00e9ration du Sud-Vi\u00eat Nam or NLF (the National Liberation Front), a South Vietnamese common front under the direction of North Vietnam, initiated a guerrilla war in the south. North Vietnam had also invaded Laos in the mid-1950s in support of insurgents, establishing the Ho Chi Minh Trail to supply and reinforce the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng. U.S. involvement escalated under President John F. Kennedy through the MAAG program from just under a thousand military advisors in 1959 to 16,000 in 1963. By 1963, the North Vietnamese had sent 40,000 soldiers to fight in South Vietnam. North Vietnam was heavily backed by the USSR and the People's Republic of China. China also sent hundreds of PLA servicemen to North Vietnam to serve in air-defense and support roles.By 1964, there were 23,000 US advisors in South Vietnam. In August, the Gulf of Tonkin incident occurred, in which a U.S. destroyer was alleged to have clashed with North Vietnamese fast attack craft. In response, the U.S Congress passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, giving President Lyndon B. Johnson broad authorization to increase U.S. military presence. He ordered the deployment of combat units for the first time and increased troop levels to 184,000. Past this point, the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) (also known as the North Vietnamese Army or NVA) engaged in more conventional warfare with U.S and South Vietnamese forces. Every year onward, there was significant build-up of U.S forces, despite little progress. U.S Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, one of the principal architects of the war, began expressing doubts of victory by the end of 1966. U.S. and South Vietnam forces relied on air superiority and overwhelming firepower to conduct search and destroy operations, involving ground forces, artillery, and airstrikes. The U.S. also conducted a large-scale strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnam and Laos.\nThe Tet Offensive of 1968 showed the lack of progress with these doctrines. With the VC and PAVN mounting large-scale urban offensives throughout 1968, U.S domestic support for the war began fading. The Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) expanded following a period of neglect after Tet and was modeled after U.S doctrine. The VC sustained heavy losses during the Tet Offensive and subsequent U.S.-ARVN operations in the rest of 1968, losing over 50,000 men. The CIA's Phoenix Program further degraded the VC's membership and capabilities. By the end of the year, the VC insurgents held almost no territory in South Vietnam, and their recruitment dropped by over 80% in 1969, signifying a drastic reduction in guerrilla operations, necessitating increased use of PAVN regular soldiers from the north. In 1969, North Vietnam declared a Provisional Revolutionary Government in South Vietnam in an attempt to give the reduced VC a more international stature, but the southern guerrillas from then on were sidelined as PAVN forces begun more conventional Combined arms warfare. Operations crossed national borders: Laos was invaded by North Vietnam early on, while Cambodia was used by North Vietnam as a supply route starting in 1967; the route through Cambodia began to be bombed by the U.S. in 1969, while the Laos route had been heavily bombed since 1964. The deposing of the monarch Norodom Sihanouk by the Cambodian National Assembly resulted in a PAVN invasion of the country at the request of the Khmer Rouge, escalating the Cambodian Civil War and resulting in a U.S.-RVN counter-invasion.\nIn 1969, following the election of U.S President Richard Nixon, a policy of ""Vietnamization"" began, which saw the conflict fought by an expanded ARVN, with U.S. forces sidelined and increasingly demoralized by domestic opposition and reduced recruitment. U.S. ground forces had largely withdrawn by early 1972 and support was limited to air support, artillery support, advisers, and materiel shipments. The ARVN, buttressed by said U.S. support, stopped the largest and first mechanized PAVN offensive to date during the Easter Offensive of 1972, which had sustained heavy casualties on both sides but failed to recapture all territory, leaving its military situation difficult. The Paris Peace Accords saw all U.S forces withdrawn; the Case\u2013Church Amendment, passed by the U.S Congress on 15 August 1973, ended direct U.S military involvement. The Peace Accords were broken almost immediately, and fighting continued for two more years. Phnom Penh fell to the Khmer Rouge on 17 April 1975 while the 1975 Spring Offensive saw the capture of Saigon by the PAVN on 30 April; this marked the end of the war, and North and South Vietnam were reunified the following year.\nThe scale of fighting was enormous: by 1970 the ARVN was the world's fourth largest army, with the PAVN being similar in size at around a million regular soldiers. The war exacted a huge human cost in terms of fatalities (see Vietnam War casualties): estimates of the number of Vietnamese soldiers and civilians killed vary from 966,000 to 3.8 million. Some 275,000\u2013310,000 Cambodians, 20,000\u201362,000 Laotians, and 58,220 U.S. service members also died in the conflict, and a further 1,626 remain missing in action.The Sino-Soviet split re-emerged following the lull during the Vietnam War. Conflict between North Vietnam and its Cambodian allies in the Royal Government of the National Union of Kampuchea, and the newly-formed Democratic Kampuchea begun almost immediately in a series of border raids by the Khmer Rouge, eventually escalating into the Cambodian\u2013Vietnamese War. Chinese forces directly invaded Vietnam in the Sino-Vietnamese War, with subsequent border conflicts lasting until 1991. Insurgencies were fought by the unified Vietnam in all three countries. The end of the war and resumption of the Third Indochina War would precipitate the Vietnamese boat people and the larger Indochina refugee crisis, which saw millions of refugees leave Indochina (mainly southern Vietnam), with an estimated 250,000 of whom perished at sea. Within the U.S, the war gave rise to what was referred to as Vietnam Syndrome, a public aversion to American overseas military involvements, which together with the Watergate scandal contributed to the crisis of confidence that affected America throughout the 1970s.","wikipedia","5.6"

"3.716","Volkswagen emissions scandal","","The Volkswagen emissions scandal, also known as Dieselgate or Emissionsgate, began in September 2015, when the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a notice of violation of the Clean Air Act to German automaker Volkswagen Group. The agency had found that Volkswagen had intentionally programmed turbocharged direct injection (TDI) diesel engines to activate their emissions controls only during laboratory emissions testing which caused the vehicles' NO x  output to meet US standards during regulatory testing, but emit up to 40 times more NO x  in real-world driving. Volkswagen deployed this software in about 11 million cars worldwide, including 500,000 in the United States, in model years 2009 through 2015.In 2014, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) had commissioned a study on emissions discrepancies between European and US models of vehicles from the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), summing up the data from three different sources on 15 vehicles. Among them was a group of five scientists at West Virginia University, who detected additional emissions during live road tests on two out of three diesel cars. ICCT also purchased data from two other sources. The new road testing data and the purchased data were generated using Portable Emissions Measurement Systems (PEMS) developed by multiple individuals in the mid-late 1990s and published  in May 2014. In 2015, Daniel Dalton MEP delivered the only legislative response to the emissions scandal that will ensure cars are tested on the roads throughout their lifetime.Regulators in multiple countries began to investigate Volkswagen, and its stock price fell in value by a third in the days immediately after the news. Volkswagen Group CEO Martin Winterkorn resigned, and the head of brand development Heinz-Jakob Neusser, Audi research and development head Ulrich Hackenberg, and Porsche research and development head Wolfgang Hatz were suspended. Volkswagen announced plans in April 2016 to spend \u20ac16.2 billion (US$18.32 billion at April 2016 exchange rates) on rectifying the emissions issues, and planned to refit the affected vehicles as part of a recall campaign. In January 2017, Volkswagen pleaded guilty to criminal charges and signed an agreed Statement of Facts, which drew on the results of an investigation Volkswagen had itself commissioned from US lawyers Jones Day. The statement set out how engineers had developed the defeat devices, because diesel models could not pass US emissions tests without them, and deliberately sought to conceal their use. In April 2017, a US federal judge ordered Volkswagen to pay a $2.8 billion criminal fine for ""rigging diesel-powered vehicles to cheat on government emissions tests"". The ""unprecedented"" plea deal formalized the punishment which Volkswagen had agreed to. Winterkorn was charged in the United States with fraud and conspiracy on 3 May 2018.The scandal raised awareness over the higher levels of pollution emitted by all diesel-powered vehicles from a wide range of car makers, which under real-world driving conditions exceeded legal emission limits. A study conducted by ICCT and ADAC showed the biggest deviations from Volvo, Renault, Jeep, Hyundai, Citro\u00ebn and Fiat, resulting in investigations opening into other  diesel emissions scandals. A discussion was sparked on the topic of software-controlled machinery being generally prone to cheating, and a way out would be to open source the software for public scrutiny.","wikipedia","5.9"
"3.719","Warburg hypothesis","","The Warburg hypothesis (), sometimes known as the Warburg theory of cancer, postulates that the driver of tumorigenesis is an insufficient cellular respiration caused by insult to mitochondria.  The term Warburg effect in oncology describes the observation that cancer cells, and many cells grown in vitro, exhibit glucose fermentation even when enough oxygen is present to properly respire.  In other words, instead of fully respiring in the presence of adequate oxygen, cancer cells ferment. The Warburg hypothesis was that the Warburg effect was the root cause of cancer. The current popular opinion is that cancer cells ferment glucose while keeping up the same level of respiration that was present before the process of carcinogenesis, and thus the Warburg effect would be defined as the observation that cancer cells exhibit glycolysis with lactate production and mitochondrial respiration even in the presence of oxygen.","wikipedia","5.8"
"3.717","War of 1812","","The War of 1812 was a conflict fought between the United States and the United Kingdom, with their respective allies, from June 1812 to February 1815. Historians in Britain often see it as a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars; historians in the United States and Canada see it as a war in its own right.\nFrom the outbreak of war with Napoleonic France, Britain had enforced a naval blockade to choke off neutral trade to France, which the US contested as illegal under international law. To man the blockade, Britain pressed American merchant sailors into the Royal Navy. American sentiment grew increasingly hostile toward Britain due to incidents such as the Chesapeake\u2013Leopard affair, which happened five years before the war. The British were in turn outraged by the Little Belt affair in 1811, in which 11 British sailors died. Britain supplied arms to American Indians who raided American settlers on the frontier, hindering American expansion and provoking resentment. Historians debate whether the desire to annex some or all of British North America (Canada) contributed to the American decision to go to war. However, the Western interest was in expansion into American territories such as Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, where they were threatened by Indians supported by the British. On June 18, 1812, President James Madison signed into law the American declaration of war, after heavy pressure from the War Hawks in Congress.With most of its army in Europe fighting Napoleon, Britain adopted a defensive strategy, with offensive operations initially limited to the border and the western frontier. American prosecution of the war effort suffered from its unpopularity, especially in New England, where it was referred to as ""Mr. Madison's War"". American defeats at the Siege of Detroit and the Battle of Queenston Heights thwarted attempts to seize Upper Canada, improving British morale. American attempts also failed to invade Lower Canada and capture Montreal. In 1813, the Americans won the Battle of Lake Erie, gaining control of the lake, and they defeated Tecumseh's Confederacy at the Battle of the Thames, securing a primary war goal. The Americans made a final attempt to invade Canada but fought to a draw at the Battle of Lundy's Lane during the summer of 1814. At sea, the powerful Royal Navy blockaded American ports, cutting off trade and allowing the British to raid the coast at will. In 1814, one of these raids burned the capital, but the Americans later repulsed British attempts to invade New York and Maryland, ending invasions from Canada into the northern and mid-Atlantic states. In early 1815, the Americans decisively defeated the invading British Army attacking New Orleans, Louisiana. Fighting also took place in Spanish Florida; a two-day battle for the city of Pensacola ended in Spanish surrender.In Britain, there was mounting opposition to wartime taxation, and merchants demanded to reopen trade with America. With the abdication of Napoleon, Britain's war with France ended and Britain ceased impressment of American sailors. This made the original cause of the war irrelevant. The British were then able to increase the strength of the blockade on the United States coast, smothering American maritime trade, but their attempts failed to invade America, at which point both sides began to desire peace.Peace negotiations began in August 1814, and the Treaty of Ghent was signed on December 24, 1814. News of the peace did not reach America for some time. In February 1815, news reached the East Coast concerning the great victory at New Orleans\u2014at the same time as news of the Christmas peace treaty. The Americans triumphantly celebrated the restoration of their national honour, leading to the collapse of anti-war sentiment and the beginning of the Era of Good Feelings, a period of national unity. The treaty was unanimously ratified by the US Senate on February 17, 1815, ending the war with no boundary changes.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.718","War on Drugs","","The war on drugs is a largely unsuccessful campaign, led by the U.S. federal government, of drug prohibition, military aid, and military intervention, with the aim being the reduction of the illegal drug trade in the United States. The initiative includes a set of drug policies that are intended to discourage the production, distribution, and consumption of psychoactive drugs that the participating governments and the UN have made illegal. The term was popularized by the media shortly after a press conference given on June 18, 1971, by President Richard Nixon\u2014the day after publication of a special message from President Nixon to the Congress on Drug Abuse Prevention and Control\u2014during which he declared drug abuse ""public enemy number one"". That message to the Congress included text about devoting more federal resources to the ""prevention of new addicts, and the rehabilitation of those who are addicted"", but that part did not receive the same public attention as the term ""war on drugs"". However, two years prior to this, Nixon had formally declared a ""war on drugs"" that would be directed toward eradication, interdiction, and incarceration. Today, the Drug Policy Alliance, which advocates for an end to the War on Drugs, estimates that the United States spends $51 billion annually on these initiatives.On May 13, 2009, Gil Kerlikowske\u2014the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP)\u2014signaled that the Obama administration did not plan to significantly alter drug enforcement policy, but also that the administration would not use the term ""War on Drugs"", because Kerlikowske considers the term to be ""counter-productive"". ONDCP's view is that ""drug addiction is a disease that can be successfully prevented and treated... making drugs more available will make it harder to keep our communities healthy and safe"".In June 2011, the Global Commission on Drug Policy released a critical report on the War on Drugs, declaring: ""The global war on drugs has failed, with devastating consequences for individuals and societies around the world. Fifty years after the initiation of the UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, and years after President Nixon launched the US government's war on drugs, fundamental reforms in national and global drug control policies are urgently needed."" The report was criticized by organizations that oppose a general legalization of drugs.\n\n","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.720","Warsaw Pact","","The Warsaw Treaty Organization (WTO); officially the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance, commonly known as the Warsaw Pact, was a collective defense treaty signed in Warsaw, Poland between the Soviet Union and seven other Eastern Bloc socialist republics of Central and Eastern Europe in May 1955, during the Cold War. The Warsaw Pact was the military complement to the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CoMEcon), the regional economic organization for the socialist states of Central and Eastern Europe. The Warsaw Pact was created in reaction to the integration of West Germany into NATO in 1955 per the London and Paris Conferences of 1954, but it is also considered to have been motivated by Soviet desires to maintain control over military forces in Central and Eastern Europe.The Warsaw Pact was established as a balance of power or counterweight to NATO; there was no direct military confrontation between them. Instead, the conflict was fought on an ideological basis and in proxy wars. Both NATO and the Warsaw Pact led to the expansion of military forces and their integration into the respective blocs. Its largest military engagement was the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968 (with the participation of all Pact nations except Albania, Romania, and East Germany), which, in part, resulted in Albania withdrawing from the pact less than a month later. The Pact began to unravel in its entirety with the spread of the Revolutions of 1989 through the Eastern Bloc, beginning with the Solidarity movement in Poland and its electoral success in June 1989.\nEast Germany withdrew from the Pact following the reunification of Germany in 1990. On 25 February 1991, at a meeting in Hungary, the Pact was declared at an end by the defense and foreign ministers of the six remaining member states. The USSR itself was dissolved in December 1991, although most of the former Soviet republics formed the Collective Security Treaty Organization shortly thereafter. Throughout the following 20 years, the seven Warsaw Pact countries outside the USSR each joined NATO (East Germany through its reunification with West Germany; and the Czech Republic and Slovakia as separate countries), as did the Baltic states which had been part of the Soviet Union.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.721","Watergate scandal","","The Watergate scandal was a major federal political scandal in the United States involving the administration of United States President Richard Nixon from 1972 to 1974 that resulted in the end of Nixon's presidency. The scandal stemmed from the June 17, 1972, break-in of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters at the Watergate Office Building in Washington, D.C., by five men and the Nixon administration's subsequent attempts to cover up its involvement in the crime. Soon after the perpetrators were arrested, the press and the Justice Department discovered a connection between cash found on them at the time and a slush fund used by the Nixon re-election campaign committee.Further investigations, along with revelations during subsequent trials of the burglars in January 1973, led the House of Representatives to grant its Judiciary Committee additional investigation authority to probe into ""certain matters within its jurisdiction,"" and the Senate to create a special investigative committee to look into the scandal. The resultant Senate Watergate hearings commenced in May 1973. Broadcast ""gavel-to-gavel"" nationwide, by PBS, the hearings aroused great public interest. Senators heard testimony that the president had approved plans to cover up administration involvement in the Watergate break-in, and learned of the existence of a voice-activated taping system in the Oval Office. Meanwhile, Nixon's administration resisted its probes, which led to a constitutional crisis.Several major revelations and egregious presidential action against the investigation later in 1973 prompted the House to commence an impeachment process against Nixon in February 1974. On July 24, 1974, while the impeachment process was under way, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in United States v. Nixon that Nixon was obligated to release the Oval Office tapes to government investigators. The tapes revealed that Nixon had conspired to cover up activities that took place after the break-in and had attempted to use federal officials to deflect the investigation. Shortly thereafter, the Judiciary Committee approved articles of impeachment against Nixon for obstruction of justice, abuse of power, and contempt of Congress and reported those articles to the House of Representatives.\nWith his complicity in the cover-up made public and his political support completely eroded, Nixon resigned from office on August 9, 1974. It is believed that, had he not done so, he would have been impeached by the House and removed from office by a trial in the Senate. To date, he is the only American president to have resigned from office. On September 8, 1974, Nixon's successor, Gerald Ford, pardoned him.\nAltogether, the scandal resulted in the indictment of 69 people. Trials or pleas resulted in 48 people\u2014many of them top Nixon administration officials\u2014being found guilty. The term Watergate, by metonymy, came to encompass an array of clandestine and often illegal activities undertaken by members of the Nixon administration. Those activities included bugging the offices of political opponents and people of whom Nixon or his officials were suspicious; ordering investigations of activist groups and political figures; and using the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as political weapons. The use of the suffix ""-gate"" after an identifying term (e.g. Bridgegate) has since become synonymous with public scandal, especially political scandal, in the United States and other parts of the world.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.722","Weather modification","","A weather modification (also known as weather control) is the act of intentionally manipulating or altering the weather. The most common form of weather modification is cloud seeding, which increases rain or snow, usually for the purpose of increasing the local water supply. Weather modification can also have the goal of preventing damaging weather, such as hail or hurricanes, from occurring; or of provoking damaging weather against the enemy, as a tactic of military or economic warfare like Operation Popeye, where clouds were seeded to prolong the monsoon in Vietnam. Weather modification in warfare has been banned by the United Nations under Environmental Modification Convention.","wikipedia","5.9"
"3.723","Wells Fargo","","Wells Fargo & Company is an American multinational financial services company headquartered in San Francisco, California, with central offices throughout the United States. It is the world's fourth-largest bank by market capitalization and the fourth largest bank in the US by total assets. Wells Fargo is ranked number 26 on the 2018 Fortune 500 rankings of the largest US corporations by total revenue. In July 2015, Wells Fargo became the world's largest bank by market capitalization, edging past ICBC, before slipping behind JPMorgan Chase in September 2016, in the wake of a scandal involving the creation of over 2 million fake bank accounts by Wells Fargo employees. Wells Fargo fell behind Bank of America to third by bank deposits in 2017 and behind Citigroup to fourth by total assets in 2018. Wells Fargo is incorporated in Delaware.The firm's primary operating subsidiary is national bank Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., which designates its main office as Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Wells Fargo in its present form is a result of a merger between San Francisco\u2013based Wells Fargo & Company and Minneapolis-based Norwest Corporation in 1998 and the subsequent 2008 acquisition of Charlotte-based Wachovia. Following the mergers, the company transferred its headquarters to Wells Fargo's headquarters in San Francisco and merged its operating subsidiary with Wells Fargo's operating subsidiary in Sioux Falls. Along with JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup, Wells Fargo is one of the ""Big Four Banks"" of the United States. As of June 2018, it had 8,050 branches and 13,000 ATMs. In 2018 the company had operations in 35 countries with over 70 million customers globally.In February 2014, Wells Fargo was named the world's most valuable bank brand for the second consecutive year in The Banker and Brand Finance study of the top 500 banking brands. In 2016, Wells Fargo ranked 7th on the Forbes Global 2000 list of largest public companies in the world and ranked 27th on the Fortune 500 list of the largest companies in the US. In 2015, the company was ranked the 22nd most admired company in the world, and the 7th most respected company in the world. As of December 2018, the company had a Standard & Poors credit rating of A\u2212. However, for a brief period in 2007, the company was the only AAA\u2011rated bank, reflecting the highest credit rating from two firms.On February 2, 2018, the US Federal Reserve Bank barred Wells Fargo from growing its nearly US$2 trillion-asset base any further, based upon years of misconduct, until Wells Fargo fixes its internal problems to the satisfaction of the Federal Reserve. In April 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported that the US Department of Labor had launched a probe into whether Wells Fargo was pushing its customers into more expensive retirement plans as well as into retirement funds managed by Wells Fargo itself. Subsequently in May 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported that Wells Fargo's business banking group had improperly altered documents about business clients in 2017 and early 2018. In June 2018, Wells Fargo began retreating from retail banking in the Midwestern United States by announcing the sale of all its physical bank branch locations in Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio to Flagstar Bank.\n\n","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.724","Wells Fargo account fraud scandal","","The Wells Fargo account fraud scandal is an ongoing controversy brought about by the creation of millions of fraudulent savings and checking accounts on behalf of Wells Fargo clients without their consent. News of the fraud became widely known in late 2016 after various regulatory bodies, including the United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), fined the company a combined US$185 million as a result of the illegal activity. The company has faced and faces additional civil and criminal suits reaching an estimated $2.7 billion by the end of 2018.Wells Fargo clients began to notice the fraud after being charged unanticipated fees and receiving unexpected credit or debit cards or lines of credit. Initial reports blamed individual Wells Fargo branch workers and managers for the problem, as well as sales incentives associated with selling multiple ""solutions"" or financial products. This blame was later shifted to a top-down pressure from higher-level management to open as many accounts as possible through cross-selling.\nThe bank took relatively few risks in the years leading up to the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008, which led to an image of stability on Wall Street and in the financial world. The bank's stable reputation was tarnished by the widespread fraud, the subsequent coverage, and the revelation of other fraudulent practices employed by the company. The controversy resulted in the resignation of CEO John Stumpf, an investigation into the bank led by U.S. Senator and 2020 presidential election candidate Elizabeth Warren, a number of settlements between Wells Fargo and various parties, and pledges from new management to reform the bank.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.725","Welsh language","","Welsh (Cymraeg [k\u0259m\u02c8r\u0251\u02d0\u0268\u0261] (listen) or y Gymraeg [\u0259 g\u0259m\u02c8r\u0251\u02d0\u0268\u0261]) is a Brittonic language of the Celtic language family. It is spoken natively in Wales, by some in England, and in Y Wladfa (the Welsh colony in Chubut Province, Argentina). Historically, it has also been known in English as ""British"", ""Cambrian"", ""Cambric"" and ""Cymric"".According to the United Kingdom Census 2011, 19 percent of residents in Wales aged three and over were able to speak Welsh. According to the 2001 Census, 21 percent of the population aged 3+ were able to speak Welsh. This suggests that there was a decrease in the number of Welsh speakers in Wales from 2001 to 2011 \u2013 from about 582,000 to 562,000 respectively. \nThe Annual Population Survey conducted by the Office for National Statistics for the year ending in March 2019 suggests that 896,900 Welsh residents (29 percent) aged three or over were able to speak Welsh. The results for the most recent National Survey for Wales (2017-2018) suggest that 19 per cent of the population aged 16 and over were able to speak Welsh, with an additional 12 per cent noting that they had ""some Welsh speaking ability"".The Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011 gave the Welsh language official status in Wales, making it the only language that is de jure official in any part of the United Kingdom, with English being de facto official. The Welsh language, along with English, is also a de jure official language of the National Assembly for Wales.","wikipedia","5.10"
"3.726","Westboro Baptist Church","","Westboro Baptist Church (WBC) is an American church known for its use of inflammatory hate speech, especially against LGBT+ people, Catholics, Orthodox Christians, atheists, Muslims, Jews, and U.S. soldiers and politicians. Multiple sources describe it as a hate group and the WBC is monitored as such by the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center. The church has been involved in actions against gay people since at least 1991, when it sought a crackdown on homosexual activity at Gage Park six blocks northwest of the church. In addition to conducting anti-gay protests at military funerals, the organization pickets celebrity funerals and public events. Protests have also been held against Jews and Catholics, and some protests have included WBC members stomping on the American flag or flying the flag upside down on a flagpole. The church also has made statements such as ""thank God for dead soldiers,"" ""God blew up the troops,"" and ""God hates America."" The church has faced several accusations of brainwashing and has been criticised as a cult.The church is headquartered in a residential neighborhood on the west side of Topeka about 3 miles (5 km) west of the Kansas State Capitol. Its first public service was held on the afternoon of November 27, 1955. The church was headed by Fred Phelps before his death in March 2014, though church representatives said the church had had no defined leader for some time before his death. The church consists primarily of members of Phelps's extended family, and in 2011, the church stated that it had about 40 members.The WBC is not affiliated with any Baptist denomination, although it describes itself as Primitive Baptist and following the five points of Calvinism. Many other Baptist churches, Baptist-affiliated seminaries, and Baptist conventions, including the Baptist World Alliance and the Southern Baptist Convention (two of the largest Baptist groups), have denounced the WBC over the years. In addition, other mainstream Christian denominations have condemned the actions of the Westboro Baptist Church.","wikipedia","5.1"
"3.727","Western civilization","","Western culture, sometimes equated with Western civilization, Occidental culture, the Western world, Western society, and European civilization, is the heritage of social norms, ethical values, traditional customs, belief systems, political systems, artifacts and technologies that originated in or are associated with Europe. The term also applies beyond Europe to countries and cultures whose histories are strongly connected to Europe by immigration, colonization, or influence. For example, Western culture includes countries in the Americas and Australasia, whose language and demographic ethnicity majorities are of European descent. Western culture is most strongly influenced by the Judeo-Christian and Greco-Roman cultures.Ancient Greece is considered the birthplace of many elements of Western culture, including the development of a democratic system of government and major advances in philosophy, science and mathematics. The expansion of Greek culture  into the Hellenistic world of the eastern Mediterranean led to a synthesis between Greek and Near-Eastern cultures, and major advances in literature, engineering, and science, and provided the culture for the expansion of early Christianity and the Greek New Testament. This period overlapped with and was followed by Rome, which made key contributions in law, government, engineering and political organization. The concept of a ""West"" dates back to the Roman Empire, where there was a cultural divide between the Greek East and Latin West, a divide that later continued in Medieval Europe between the Catholic Latin Church west and the ""Greek"" Eastern Orthodox east.\nWestern culture is characterized by a host of artistic, philosophic, literary and legal themes and traditions. Christianity, including the Roman Catholic Church, Protestantism the Eastern Orthodox Church, and Oriental Orthodoxy, has played a prominent role in the shaping of Western civilization since at least the 4th century, as did Judaism. A cornerstone of Western thought, beginning in ancient Greece and continuing through the Middle Ages and Renaissance, is the idea of rationalism in various spheres of life developed by Hellenistic philosophy, scholasticism and humanism. The Catholic Church was for centuries at the center of the development of the values, ideas, science, laws and institutions which constitute Western civilization. Empiricism later gave rise to the scientific method, the scientific revolution, and the Age of Enlightenment.\nWestern culture continued to develop with the Christianisation of Europe during the Middle Ages, the reforms triggered by the Renaissance of the 12th century and 13th century under the influence of the Islamic world via Al-Andalus and Sicily (including the transfer of technology from the East, and Latin translations of Arabic texts on science and philosophy), and the Italian Renaissance as Greek scholars fleeing the fall of the Byzantine Empire brought classical traditions and philosophy. Medieval Christianity is credited with creating the modern university, the modern hospital system, scientific economics, and natural law (which would later influence the creation of international law).  Christianity played a role in ending practices common among pagan societies, such as human sacrifice, slavery, infanticide and polygamy. The globalization by successive European colonial empires spread European ways of life and European educational methods around the world between the 16th and 20th centuries. European culture developed with a complex range of philosophy, medieval scholasticism, mysticism and Christian and secular humanism. Rational thinking developed through a long age of change and formation, with the experiments of the Enlightenment and breakthroughs in the sciences. Tendencies that have come to define modern Western societies include the concept of political pluralism, individualism, prominent subcultures or countercultures (such as New Age movements) and increasing cultural syncretism resulting from globalization and human migration.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.728","White American","","White Americans are a racial or ethnic group of Americans who identify as and are perceived to be white people. The term is usually used to refer to those of European descent, though is at times also used to refer to Americans of North African and Middle Eastern descent (for example, in the US Census definition). White Americans (including White Hispanics) constitute the historical and current majority of the people living in the United States, with 72% of the population identifying as white in the 2010 United States Census. Non-Hispanic whites totaled about 197,285,202 or 60.7% of the U.S. population. European Americans are the largest ethnic group of White Americans and constitute the historical majority population of the United States since the nation's founding.\nThe United States Census Bureau defines white people as those ""having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East or North Africa."" The Census definition is controversial for its inclusion of Middle Eastern and North African peoples as white, and the Obama-era Census Bureau had planned to change this definition prior to the election of Donald Trump. Like all official U.S. racial categories, ""White"" has a ""not Hispanic or Latino"" and a ""Hispanic or Latino"" component, the latter consisting mostly of White Mexican Americans and White Cuban Americans. The term ""Caucasian"" is synonymous with ""white"", although the latter is sometimes used to denote skin tone instead of race. Some of the non-European ethnic groups classified as white by the U.S. Census, such as Arab Americans, Jewish Americans, and Hispanics or Latinos, may not identify as or may not be perceived to be, white.\nThe largest ancestries of American whites are: German (17%), Irish (12%), English (9%), Italian (6%), French (4%), Polish (3%), Scottish (3%), Scotch-Irish (2%), Dutch (2%), Norwegian (2%) and Swedish (1%). However, the English and British Americans' demography is considered a serious under-count as the stock tend to self-report and identify as simply ""Americans"" (7%), due to the length of time they have inhabited the United States, particularly if their family arrived prior to the American Revolution. The vast majority of white Americans also have ancestry from multiple countries.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.729","White supremacy","","White supremacy or white supremacism is the racist belief that white people are superior to people of other races and therefore should be dominant over them. White supremacy has roots in the now-discredited doctrine of scientific racism and often relies on pseudoscientific arguments. Like most similar movements such as neo-Nazism, white supremacists typically oppose members of other races as well as Jews.\nThe term is also used to describe a political ideology that perpetuates and maintains the social, political, historical, or institutional domination by white people (as evidenced by historical and contemporary sociopolitical structures such as the Atlantic slave trade, Jim Crow laws in the United States, the set of ""White Australia"" policies from the 1890s until the mid-1970s, and apartheid in South Africa). Different forms of white supremacism put forth different conceptions of who is considered white, and different groups of white supremacists identify various racial and cultural groups as their primary enemy.In academic usage, particularly in usage which draws on critical race theory or intersectionality, the term ""white supremacy"" can also refer to a political or socioeconomic system, in which white people enjoy a structural advantage (privilege) over other ethnic groups, on both a collective and individual level.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.730","Wikipedia","","Wikipedia ( (listen) wik-ih-PEE-dee-\u0259 or  (listen) wik-ee-PEE-dee-\u0259) is a multilingual online encyclopedia created and maintained as an open collaboration project by a community of volunteer editors using a wiki-based editing system. It is the largest and most popular general reference work on the World Wide Web, and is one of the most popular websites ranked by Alexa as of January 2020. It features exclusively free content and no commercial ads, and is owned and supported by the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organization funded primarily through donations.Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger. Sanger coined its name, as a portmanteau of ""wiki"" (the Hawaiian word for ""quick"") and ""encyclopedia"". Initially an English-language encyclopedia, versions of Wikipedia in other languages were quickly developed. With at least 6,024,235 articles, the English Wikipedia is the largest of the more than 290 Wikipedia encyclopedias. Overall, Wikipedia comprises more than 40 million articles in 301 different languages and by February 2014 it had reached 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors per month.In 2005, Nature published a peer review comparing 42 hard science articles from Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica and Wikipedia and found that Wikipedia's level of accuracy approached that of Britannica, although critics suggested that it might not have fared so well in a similar study of a random sampling of all articles or one focused on social science or contentious social issues. The following year, Time magazine stated that the open-door policy of allowing anyone to edit had made Wikipedia the biggest and possibly the best encyclopedia in the world, and was a testament to the vision of Jimmy Wales.Wikipedia has been criticized for exhibiting systemic bias, for presenting a mixture of ""truth, half truth, and some falsehoods"", and for being subject to manipulation and spin in controversial topics. Wikipedia has been criticized for gender bias, particularly on its English-language site, where the dominant majority of editors are male. However, Edit-a-thons have been held to encourage female editors and increase the coverage of women's topics. Facebook announced that by 2017 it would help readers detect fake news by suggesting links to related Wikipedia articles. YouTube announced a similar plan in 2018.","wikipedia","5.13"
"3.731","Windows Vista","","Windows Vista is an operating system that was produced by Microsoft for use on personal computers, including home and business desktops, laptops, tablet PCs and media center PCs. Development was completed on November 8, 2006, and over the following three months, it was released in stages to computer hardware and software manufacturers, business customers and retail channels. On January 30, 2007, it was released worldwide and was made available for purchase and download from the Windows Marketplace; it is the first release of Windows to be made available through a digital distribution platform. The release of Windows Vista came more than five years after the introduction of its predecessor, Windows XP, the longest time span between successive releases of Microsoft Windows desktop operating systems.\nNew features of Windows Vista include an updated graphical user interface and visual style dubbed Aero, a new search component called Windows Search, redesigned networking, audio, print and display sub-systems, and new multimedia tools such as Windows DVD Maker. Vista aimed to increase the level of communication between machines on a home network, using peer-to-peer technology to simplify sharing files and media between computers and devices. Windows Vista included version 3.0 of the .NET Framework, allowing software developers to write applications without traditional Windows APIs.\nMicrosoft's primary stated objective with Windows Vista was to improve the state of security in the Windows operating system. One common criticism of Windows XP and its predecessors was their commonly exploited security vulnerabilities and overall susceptibility to malware, viruses and buffer overflows. In light of this, Microsoft chairman Bill Gates announced in early 2002 a company-wide ""Trustworthy Computing initiative"", which aimed to incorporate security into every aspect of software development at the company. Microsoft stated that it prioritized improving the security of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 above finishing Windows Vista, thus delaying its completion.While these new features and security improvements garnered positive reviews, Vista was also the target of much criticism and negative press. Criticism of Windows Vista targeted its high system requirements, its more restrictive licensing terms, the inclusion of a number of then-new DRM technologies aimed at restricting the copying of protected digital media, lack of compatibility with some pre-Vista hardware and software, longer boot time, and the number of authorization prompts for User Account Control. As a result of these and other issues, Windows Vista saw initial adoption and satisfaction rates lower than Windows XP.

"3.732","Wiretapping","","Telephone tapping (also wire tapping or wiretapping in American English) is the monitoring of telephone and Internet-based conversations by a third party, often by covert means. The wire tap received its name because, historically, the monitoring connection was an actual electrical tap on the telephone line. Legal wiretapping by a government agency is also called lawful interception. Passive wiretapping monitors or records the traffic, while active wiretapping alters or otherwise affects it.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.733","Women","","A woman is a female human being. The word woman is usually reserved for an adult; girl is the usual term for a female child or adolescent. The plural women is also sometimes used for female humans, regardless of age, as in phrases such as ""women's rights"".\nTypically, a woman has two X chromosomes and is capable of pregnancy and giving birth from puberty until menopause. Female anatomy, as distinguished from male anatomy, includes the fallopian tubes, ovaries, uterus, vulva, breasts, Skene's glands, and Bartholin's glands. The female pelvis is wider than the male, the hips are generally broader, and women have significantly less facial and other body hair. On average, women are shorter and less muscular than men.\nThroughout human history, traditional gender roles have often defined and limited women's activities and opportunities; many religious doctrines stipulate certain rules for women. With restrictions loosening during the 20th century in many societies, women have gained access to careers beyond the traditional homemaker, and the ability to pursue higher education. Violence against women, whether within families or in communities, has a long history and is primarily committed by men. Some women are denied reproductive rights. The movements and ideologies of feminism have a shared goal of achieving gender equality.\nSome women are trans (those who have a male sex assignment that does not align with their gender identity), or intersex (those born with sexual characteristics that do not fit typical notions of male or female).","wikipedia","['5.7','5.13']"
"3.734","Women's rights","","Women's rights are the rights and entitlements claimed for women and girls worldwide, and which formed the basis for the women's rights movement in the 19th century and feminist movement during the 20th century. In some countries, these rights are institutionalized or supported by law, local custom, and behavior, whereas in others they are ignored and suppressed. They differ from broader notions of human rights through claims of an inherent historical and traditional bias against the exercise of rights by women and girls, in favor of men and boys.Issues commonly associated with notions of women's rights include the right to bodily integrity and autonomy; to be free from sexual violence; to vote; to hold public office; to enter into legal contracts; to have equal rights in family law; to work; to fair wages or equal pay; to have reproductive rights; to own property; to education.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.735","Womyn","","The word womyn is one of several alternative spellings of the English word women used by some feminists. There are other spellings, including womban (a reference to the womb) or womon (singular), and wimmin (plural). Some writers who use such alternative spellings, avoiding the suffix ""-man"" or ""-men"", see them as an expression of female independence and a repudiation of traditions that define women by reference to a male norm. Recently, womxn has been used by intersectional feminists to indicate the same ideas, with explicit inclusion of transgender women and women of color.Historically, ""womyn"" and other spelling variants were associated with regional dialects (e.g. Scots) and eye dialect (e.g. African American Vernacular English).","wikipedia","5.5"

"3.737","World War I","","World War I (often abbreviated as WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. Contemporaneously described as ""the war to end all wars"", it led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, making it one of the largest wars in history. It is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history, with an estimated nine million combatants and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war, while resulting genocides and the resulting 1918 influenza pandemic caused another 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide.On 28 June 1914, Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian Serb Yugoslav nationalist, assassinated the Austro-Hungarian heir Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo, leading to the July Crisis. In response, on 23 July, Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia. Serbia's reply failed to satisfy the Austrians, and the two moved to a war footing.\nA network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the Balkans to one involving most of Europe. By July 1914, the great powers of Europe were divided into two coalitions: the Triple Entente\u2014consisting of France, Russia, and Britain\u2014and the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy (the Triple Alliance was only defensive in nature, allowing Italy to stay out of the war until April 1915, when it joined the Allied Powers after its relations with Austria-Hungary deteriorated). Russia felt it necessary to back Serbia and, after Austria-Hungary shelled the Serbian capital of Belgrade on the 28 July, approved partial mobilisation. Full Russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30 July; on the 31st, Austria-Hungary and Germany did the same, while Germany demanded Russia demobilise within twelve hours. When Russia failed to comply, Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August in support of Austria-Hungary, with Austria-Hungary following suit on 6 August; France ordered full mobilisation in support of Russia on 2 August.German strategy for a war on two fronts against France and Russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its army in the West to defeat France within six weeks, then shift forces to the East before Russia could fully mobilise; this was later known as the Schlieffen Plan. On 2 August, Germany demanded free passage through Belgium, an essential element in achieving a quick victory over France. When this was refused, German forces invaded Belgium on 3 August and declared war on France the same day; the Belgian government invoked the 1839 Treaty of London and in compliance with its obligations under this, Britain declared war on Germany on 4 August. On 12 August, Britain and France also declared war on Austria-Hungary; on the 23 August, Japan sided with Britain, seizing German possessions in China and the Pacific. In November 1914, the Ottoman Empire entered the war on the side of the Central Powers, opening fronts in the Caucasus, Mesopotamia, and the Sinai Peninsula. The war was fought in and drew upon each power's colonial empire as well, spreading the conflict to Africa and across the globe. The Entente and its allies would eventually become known as the Allied Powers, while the grouping of Austria-Hungary, Germany and their allies would become known as the Central Powers.\nThe German advance into France was halted at the Battle of the Marne and by the end of 1914, the Western Front settled into a battle of attrition, marked by a long series of trench lines that changed little until 1917 (the Eastern Front, by contrast, was marked by much greater exchanges of territory). In 1915, Italy joined the Allied Powers and opened a front in the Alps. Bulgaria joined the Central Powers in 1915 and Greece joined the Allies in 1917, expanding the war in the Balkans. The United States initially remained neutral, though even while neutral it became an important supplier of war materiel to the Allies. Eventually, after the sinking of American merchant ships by German submarines, the declaration by Germany that its navy would resume unrestricted attacks on neutral shipping, and the revelation that Germany was trying to incite Mexico to make war on the United States, the U.S. declared war on Germany on 6 April 1917. Trained American forces would not begin arriving at the front in large numbers until mid-1918, but ultimately the American Expeditionary Force would reach some two million troops.Though Serbia was defeated in 1915, and Romania joined the Allied Powers in 1916 only to be defeated in 1917, none of the great powers were knocked out of the war until 1918. The 1917 February Revolution in Russia replaced the Tsarist autocracy with the Provisional Government, but continuing discontent with the cost of the war led to the October Revolution, the creation of the Soviet Socialist Republic, and the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk by the new government in March 1918, ending Russia's involvement in the war. This allowed the transfer of large numbers of German troops from the East to the Western Front, resulting in the German March 1918 Offensive. This offensive was initially successful, but failed to score a decisive victory and exhausted the last of the German reserves. The Allies rallied and drove the Germans back in their Hundred Days Offensive, a continual series of attacks to which the Germans had no reply. Bulgaria was the first Central Power to sign an armistice\u2014the Armistice of Salonica on 29 September 1918. On 30 October, the Ottoman Empire capitulated, signing the Armistice of Mudros. On 4 November, the Austro-Hungarian empire agreed to the Armistice of Villa Giusti. With its allies defeated, revolution at home, and the military no longer willing to fight, Kaiser Wilhelm abdicated on 9 November and Germany signed an armistice on 11 November 1918, effectively ending the war.\nWorld War I was a significant turning point in the political, cultural, economic, and social climate of the world. It is considered to mark the end of the Second Industrial Revolution and the Pax Britannica. The war and its immediate aftermath sparked numerous revolutions and uprisings. The Big Four (Britain, France, the United States, and Italy) imposed their terms on the defeated powers in a series of treaties agreed at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference, the most well known being the German peace treaty\u2014the Treaty of Versailles. Ultimately, as a result of the war the Austro-Hungarian, German, Ottoman, and Russian Empires ceased to exist, with numerous new states created from their remains. However, despite the conclusive Allied victory (and the creation of the League of Nations during the Peace Conference, intended to prevent future wars), a second world war would follow just over twenty years later.","wikipedia","5.6"
"3.738","World War II","","World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945. The vast majority of the world's countries\u2014including all the great powers\u2014eventually formed two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. A state of total war emerged, directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries. The major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history, marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities, most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China. It included massacres, the genocide of the Holocaust, strategic bombing, premeditated death from starvation and disease, and the only use of nuclear weapons in war.\nJapan, which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific, was at war with China by 1937, though neither side had declared war on the other. World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939, with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and treaties, Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe, and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan. Under the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours, Poland, Finland, Romania and the Baltic states. Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa, and the Fall of France in mid 1940, the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire. War in the Balkans, the aerial Battle of Britain, the Blitz, and the long Battle of the Atlantic followed. On 22 June 1941, the European Axis powers launched an invasion of the Soviet Union, opening the largest land theatre of war in history. This Eastern Front trapped the Axis, most crucially the German Wehrmacht, in a war of attrition. In December 1941, Japan launched a surprise attack on the United States as well as European colonies in the Pacific. Following an immediate U.S. declaration of war against Japan, supported by one from Great Britain, the European Axis powers quickly declared war on the U.S. in solidarity with their Japanese ally. Rapid Japanese conquests over much of the Western Pacific ensued, perceived by many in Asia as liberation from Western dominance and resulting in the support of several armies from defeated territories.\nThe Axis advance in the Pacific halted in 1942 when Japan lost the critical Battle of Midway; later, Germany and Italy were defeated in North Africa and then, decisively, at Stalingrad in the Soviet Union. Key setbacks in 1943, which included a series of German defeats on the Eastern Front, the Allied invasions of Sicily and Italy, and Allied victories in the Pacific, cost the Axis its initiative and forced it into strategic retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies invaded German-occupied France, while the Soviet Union regained its territorial losses and turned toward Germany and its allies. During 1944 and 1945 the Japanese suffered major reverses in mainland Asia, in Central China, South China and Burma, while the Allies crippled the Japanese Navy and captured key Western Pacific islands.\nThe war in Europe concluded with an invasion of Germany by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, culminating in the capture of Berlin by Soviet troops, the suicide of Adolf Hitler and the German unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945. Following the Potsdam Declaration by the Allies on 26 July 1945 and the refusal of Japan to surrender under its terms, the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6 and 9 August respectively. With an invasion of the Japanese archipelago imminent, the possibility of additional atomic bombings, the Soviet entry into the war against Japan and its invasion of Manchuria, Japan announced its intention to surrender on 15 August 1945, cementing total victory in Asia for the Allies. Tribunals were set up by the Allies, and war crimes trials were conducted in the wake of the war both against the Germans and against the Japanese.\nWorld War II changed the political alignment and social structure of the globe. The United Nations (UN) was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts; the victorious great powers\u2014China, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States\u2014became the permanent members of its Security Council. The Soviet Union and United States emerged as rival superpowers, setting the stage for the nearly half-century long Cold War. In the wake of European devastation, the influence of its great powers waned, triggering the decolonisation of Africa and Asia. Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery and expansion. Political integration, especially in Europe, emerged as an effort to end pre-war enmities and create a common identity.","wikipedia","5.6"

Being the largest province-level division of China and the 8th largest country subdivision in the world, Xinjiang spans over 1.6 million km2 (640,000 square miles). The Aksai Chin region, administered by China mostly as part of Xinjiang's Hotan Prefecture, is claimed by India. Xinjiang borders the countries of Mongolia (Bayan-\u00d6lgii, Khovd and Govi-Altai Provinces), Russia (Altai Republic), Kazakhstan (East Kazakhstan and Almaty Provinces), Kyrgyzstan (Issyk Kul, Naryn and Osh Regions), Tajikistan (Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region), Afghanistan (Badakhshan Province), Pakistan (Gilgit Baltistan) and India (Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir). The rugged Karakoram, Kunlun and Tian Shan mountain ranges occupy much of Xinjiang's borders, as well as its western and southern regions. Xinjiang also borders the Tibet Autonomous Region and the provinces of Gansu and Qinghai. The most well-known route of the historical Silk Road ran through the territory from the east to its northwestern border.\nIn recent decades, abundant oil and mineral reserves have been found in Xinjiang and it is currently China's largest natural-gas-producing region.\nIt is home to a number of ethnic groups, including the Uyghur, Han, Kazakhs, Tibetans, Hui, Tajiks, Kyrgyz, Mongols, Russians and Xibe. More than a dozen autonomous prefectures and counties for minorities are in Xinjiang. Older English-language reference works often refer to the area as Chinese Turkestan. Xinjiang is divided into the Dzungarian Basin in the north and the Tarim Basin in the south by a mountain range. Only about 9.7% of Xinjiang's land area is fit for human habitation.With a documented history of at least 2,500 years, a succession of people and empires have vied for control over all or parts of this territory. The territory came under the rule of the Qing dynasty in the 18th century, which was later replaced by the Republic of China government. Since 1949, it has been part of the People's Republic of China following the Chinese Civil War. In 1954, Xinjiang Bingtuan was set up to strengthen the border defense against the Soviet Union and also promote the local economy. In 1955, Xinjiang was turned into an autonomous region from a province. In the last decades, the East Turkestan independent movement, separatist conflict and the influence of radical Islam have both resulted in unrest in the region, with occasional terrorist attacks and clashes between separatist and government forces.","wikipedia","5.5"
"3.741","Xinjiang re-education camps","","The Xinjiang re-education camps, officially called Vocational Education and Training Centers by the government of the People's Republic of China, are internment camps that have been operated by the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region government for the purpose of indoctrinating Uyghurs since 2017 as part of a ""people's war on terror"" announced in 2014. The camps were established under General Secretary Xi Jinping's administration and led by hardline party secretary, Chen Quanguo. These camps are reportedly operated outside the legal system; many Uyghurs have reportedly been interned without trial and no charges have been levied against them. Local authorities are reportedly holding hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs in these camps as well as other ethnic minority groups, for the stated purpose of countering extremism and terrorism and promoting sinicization.As of 2018, it was estimated that the Chinese authorities may have detained hundreds of thousands, perhaps a million, Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz and other ethnic Turkic Muslims, Christians as well as some foreign citizens such as Kazakhstanis, who are being held in these secretive internment camps which are located throughout the region. In May 2018, Randall Schriver of the United States Department of Defense claimed that ""at least a million but likely closer to three million citizens"" were imprisoned in detention centers in a strong condemnation of the ""concentration camps"". In August 2018, a United Nations human rights panel said that it had received many credible reports that 1 million ethnic Uyghurs in China have been held in ""re-education camps"". There have also been multiple reports from media, politicians and researchers comparing the camps to the Chinese Cultural Revolution.\nIn 2019, the United Nations ambassadors from 22 nations, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom signed a letter condemning China's mass detention of the Uyghurs and other minority groups, urging the Chinese government to close the camps. Conversely, a joint statement was signed by 37 states commending China's counter-terrorism program in Xinjiang, including Algeria, the DR Congo, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, North Korea, Egypt, Nigeria, the Philippines and Sudan.","wikipedia","5.5"

Judaeo-German) is the historical language of the Ashkenazi Jews. It originated during the 9th century in Central Europe, providing the nascent Ashkenazi community with a High German-based vernacular fused with elements taken from Hebrew and Aramaic as well as from Slavic languages and traces of Romance languages. Yiddish writing uses the Hebrew alphabet.\nThe earliest surviving references date from the 12th century and call the language \u05dc\u05e9\u05d5\u05df\u05be\u05d0\u05b7\u05e9\u05db\u05bc\u05e0\u05d6\u200e (loshn-ashknaz, ""language of Ashkenaz"") or \u05d8\u05f2\u05b7\u05d8\u05e9\u200e (taytsh), a variant of tiutsch, the contemporary name for Middle High German. Colloquially, the language is sometimes called \u05de\u05d0\u05b7\u05de\u05e2\u05be\u05dc\u05e9\u05d5\u05df\u200e (mame-loshn, lit. ""mother tongue""), distinguishing it from \u05dc\u05e9\u05d5\u05df\u05be\u05e7\u05d5\u05d3\u05e9\u200e (loshn koydesh, ""holy tongue""), meaning Hebrew and Aramaic. The term ""Yiddish"", short for Yidish Taitsh (""Jewish German""), did not become the most frequently used designation in the literature until the 18th century. In the late 19th and into the 20th century the language was more commonly called ""Jewish"", especially in non-Jewish contexts, but ""Yiddish"" is again the more common designation today.Modern Yiddish has two major forms. Eastern Yiddish is far more common today. It includes Southeastern (Ukrainian\u2013Romanian), Mideastern (Polish\u2013Galician\u2013Eastern Hungarian), and Northeastern (Lithuanian\u2013Belarusian) dialects. Eastern Yiddish differs from Western both by its far greater size and by the extensive inclusion of words of Slavic origin. Western Yiddish is divided into Southwestern (Swiss\u2013Alsatian\u2013Southern German), Midwestern (Central German), and Northwestern (Netherlandic\u2013Northern German) dialects. Yiddish is used in a number of Haredi Jewish communities worldwide; it is the first language of the home, school, and in many social settings among many Haredi Jews, and is used in most Hasidic and some Lithuanian yeshivas.\nThe term ""Yiddish"" is also used in the adjectival sense, synonymously with ""Jewish"", to designate attributes of Yiddishkeit (""Ashkenazi culture""; for example, Yiddish cooking and ""Yiddish music"" - klezmer).Prior to the Holocaust, there were 11\u201313 million speakers of Yiddish among 17 million Jews worldwide. 85% of the approximately 6 million Jews who died in the Holocaust were Yiddish speakers, leading to a massive decline in the use of the language. Assimilation following World War II and aliyah, immigration to Israel, further decreased the use of Yiddish both among survivors and among Yiddish-speakers from other countries (such as in the Americas). However, the number of speakers is increasing in Hasidic communities.","wikipedia","5.10"

The official name of the state was changed to Kingdom of Yugoslavia on 3 October 1929.\nYugoslavia was invaded by the Axis powers on 6 April 1941. In 1943, a Democratic Federal Yugoslavia was proclaimed by the Partisan resistance. In 1944 King Peter II, then living in exile, recognised it as the legitimate government. The monarchy was subsequently abolished in November 1945. Yugoslavia was renamed the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia in 1946, when a communist government was established. It acquired the territories of Istria, Rijeka, and Zadar from Italy. Partisan leader Josip Broz Tito ruled the country as president until his death in 1980. In 1963, the country was renamed again, as the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY).\nThe six constituent republics that made up the SFRY were the SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, SR Croatia, SR Macedonia, SR Montenegro, SR Serbia, and SR Slovenia. Serbia contained two Socialist Autonomous Provinces, Vojvodina and Kosovo, which after 1974 were largely equal to the other members of the federation. After an economic and political crisis in the 1980s and the rise of nationalism, Yugoslavia broke up along its republics' borders, at first into five countries, leading to the Yugoslav Wars. From 1993 to 2017, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia tried political and military leaders from the former Yugoslavia for war crimes, genocide, and other crimes committed during those wars.\nAfter the breakup, the republics of Montenegro and Serbia formed a reduced federative state, Serbia and Montenegro, known officially until 2003 as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY). This state aspired to the status of sole legal successor to the SFRY, but those claims were opposed by the other former republics. Eventually, it accepted the opinion of the Badinter Arbitration Committee about shared succession and in 2003 its official name was changed to Serbia and Montenegro. This state dissolved when Montenegro and Serbia each became independent states in 2006, while Kosovo proclaimed its independence from Serbia in 2008.","wikipedia","5.5"

"3.746","Zaire","","Zaire (), officially the Republic of Zaire (French: R\u00e9publique du Za\u00efre; French pronunciation: \u200b[za.i\u0281]), was the name of a sovereign state between 1971 and 1997 in Central Africa that is now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The country was a one-party totalitarian dictatorship, run by Mobutu Sese Seko and his ruling Popular Movement of the Revolution party. Zaire was established following Mobutu's seizure of power in a military coup in 1965, following five years of political upheaval following independence known as the Congo Crisis. Zaire had a strongly centralist constitution, and foreign assets were nationalized. The period is sometimes referred to as the Second Congolese Republic.\nA wider campaign of Authenticit\u00e9, ridding the country of the influences from the colonial era of the Belgian Congo, was also launched under Mobutu's direction. Weakened by the termination of American support after the end of the Cold War, Mobutu was forced to declare a new republic in 1990 to cope with demands for change. By the time of its downfall, Zaire was characterised by widespread cronyism, corruption and economic mismanagement.\nZaire collapsed in the 1990s, amid the destabilization of the eastern parts of the country in the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide and growing ethnic violence. In 1996, Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila, the head of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (AFDL) militia, led a popular rebellion against Mobutu. With rebel forces successfully making gains beyond the east, Mobutu fled the country, leaving Kabila's forces in charge as the country restored its name to the Democratic Republic of the Congo the following year. Mobutu died within four months after he fled into exile in Morocco.\n\n","wikipedia","5.5"

Good governance relies on internal mechanisms, like the structure of a board and the incentives put in place for management, and on external mechanisms such as institutions that demand transparency and accountability. All of these mechanisms vary in form depending on location, and on economic and legal context. And they are all enormously important, since they sit at the core of how (and for whom) corporations generate value. Ultimately, corporate governance can help deliver economic gains, while also contributing to the development of more inclusive societies.

"4.0","21st Century Curricula","","Educational curricula that impart the knowledge and skills that are actually relevant to the modern workplace, help build early learner identities, develop local and global citizenship values, and nourish core non-cognitive skills are essential. Education creates the base for future re-skilling and self-actualization, and for civic identity. As noted in the World Economic Forum’s 2017 white paper Realizing Human Potential in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, educational curricula cannot remain fixed, as career paths change faster, and are less linear, than ever before. There is wide-ranging consensus that no single skill set or area of expertise is likely to be able to sustain a long-term career in the economies of the future. Educational institutions need to provide both in-depth subject knowledge, and an ability to make inter-disciplinary connections. The Forum’s 2016 report The Future of Jobs noted that the core skills of the 21st century - such as complex problem solving, critical thinking, creativity, collaboration, and digital literacy - are important for enabling people to be flexible enough to adapt to the changing needs of the job market. These skills are ideally developed early, in basic education, and then refined at colleges and universities as well as during lifelong learning. Future-ready curricula must deliver a strong base of foundational linguistic, mathematical, and technological skills. However, shifting demand for skills across industries will require that curricula be updated and adapted on a regular basis, as they are informed by the evolution of labour markets. Upgrades to curricula should be built into the system incrementally, thereby avoiding the excessive disruption and implementation time-lag associated with major, infrequent overhauls. In order to ensure that education remains job-relevant, it is critical that more emphasis is placed on collating insights from government, businesses, and civil society in the curriculum design process.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.43"
"4.1","3D Printing and Intellectual Property","","3D printing is revolutionizing manufacturing, and will probably become a part of our everyday lives. It is easy to imagine that just about every household will have a 3D printer at some point, and that everyone will be able to whip up physical products after downloading a digital file. However, the simplicity of 3D printing facilitates copying. Even if a product has intellectual property (copyright or patent) protections - whether it’s the tablet that can combine multiple drugs developed at the National University of Singapore, or the dress 3-D printed for New York Fashion Week in 2016 - it is as theoretically liable to be pirated as a song or film. Manufacturers do not yet see consumer 3D printing as a threat, however, because the quality of what they can produce - at this point, anyway - is relatively inferior in terms of colours and materials, according to a report published by the UK Intellectual Property Office in 2018. However, it is important to consider whether current intellectual property protections will remain sufficient as the technology further develops. At a first glance, both national laws and international conventions seem to cover most important aspects of 3D printing. There are protections for the external features of a product, its ornamental or aesthetic aspect, its shape and form, and its two-dimensional patterns and colour. Meanwhile copyright protections cover original “works of authorship” like literary creations or maps, as well as a creator’s right to reproduce these works for extended periods. Copyright can protect the software used to operate a 3D printer, for example, and can also probably protect 3D digital files. Patents, meanwhile, can protect inventions and the technical functions of 3D printing, while trademarks enable creators to distinguish their goods or services from those of their competitors. Nevertheless, there are a few related issues that lawyers will have to tackle. For example: distinguishing the ownership of a product that was created by one person, digitally modeled by another, and printed by a third. In addition, mechanisms to better control digital piracy will have to be created. Perhaps the music industry could serve as inspiration in this regard, and the creators of 3D digital files will partner with sharing platforms that can make files publicly (and legally) available via an online marketplace.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.0"
"4.2","3D Printing and the Environment","","3D printing (or “additive manufacturing”) is capable of significantly reducing the amount of raw materials necessary to make things. Conventional machining processes, for example, are based on the “subtractive” removal of material from larger blocks, until a final geometry is achieved. By way of contrast, 3D printing successively adds material in a layer-by-layer process, and selectively applies it only where it is needed - facilitating a “near net shape” technique that produces parts as near as possible to a final shape, and eliminates much of the need for finishing. The resulting lack of waste material is due to the fact that only a small amount of total material needs to be re-machined in order to achieve a desired surface roughness, or to remove support structures. Meanwhile the 3D printing-related concept of Design for Additive Manufacturing enables the application of hollow, lighter-weight lattice structures and components, which further decrease the so-called “energy burden.” An ability to produce lightweight parts is particularly crucial for the aerospace industry. GKN Aerospace, for example, has said it has used 3D printing to significantly reduce its so-called “buy-to-fly ratio” such that only about 10% of material used in production ends up as scrap. Lockheed Martin has meanwhile managed to reduce the buy-to-fly ratio of its bleed air leak detector brackets all the way to 1:1 from 33:1 by using 3D printing, according to a report published by Deloitte. Another example is Airbus’s work with design software firm Autodesk to develop a “bionic” cabin partition with more than 100 3D-printed parts for its A320 aircraft. According to Autodesk, installing the lighter partitions throughout an A320 would remove as much 500 kilograms of weight. The resulting decrease in fuel use would eliminate up to 166 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions per aircraft every year - and, multiplied across thousands of A320s, could cut emissions by hundreds of thousands of tons annually.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.0"
"4.3","3D Printing for Construction","","The world suffers from a lack of housing. According to the World Resources Institute, the global affordable housing gap is expected to rise to 440 million households by 2025 - depriving roughly 1.6 billion people of an adequate and affordable home. 3D printing may be able to help. The technology enables new, significantly faster and more economical approaches to construction. Construction-related 3D printing processes differ slightly from traditional 3D printing, due to the size of the desired product; they involve a large, robotic arm that moves via railways that are installed around a building area as they extrude concrete, layer by layer. These large machines are able to create complete buildings, use less material than traditional construction by producing honeycomb-structured walls with minimal density, and require lower-cost materials that can keep expenses to a minimum. Before it can be made available broadly for commercial use, however, construction-related 3D printing must be further tested, standardized, and approved by regulators. Still, both startups and established construction companies are already developing related projects, achieving breakthroughs, and using new materials. For example, US-based startup Apis Cor famously managed in 2017 to 3D print an entire 38-square-metre house in 24 hours - at a cost of about $10,000. In addition to reducing time and costs, 3D printing has an environmental impact on construction, as less material is used and less waste is produced; it also reduces the risk of accidents, and enables the creation of complex architectural shapes. It may also stir greater competition within the construction industry, potentially leading to lower prices and greater rates of ownership. Overpopulated and fast-growing cities in particular stand to benefit from the technology. Dubai has announced that by 2025, 25% of its new buildings will be created using 3D printers - which could reduce the amount of required labour by 70%, and expenses by 90%. 3D printing can also help develop relatively inaccessible areas. The Italian company WASP, for example, has developed a 3D printer that works on solar or wind power and is able to print eco-friendly shelters using local materials in regions without electricity.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.0"
"4.4","3D Printing in Space","","3D printing (or “additive manufacturing”) has the potential to optimize space missions in the future, and transform the aerospace industry. In 2018, the world’s first satellite with a 3D-printed exterior casing (printed at Tomsk Polytechnic University in Russia) was launched from the International Space Station - in order to test how such components behave in a vacuum. In addition, 3D printing technology is being used to build everything from rocket engines to support brackets for satellites. However, the biggest impact 3D printing will have on space missions will not be on the ground. Instead, it will arrive in the form of enabling manufacturing in space. Long-term space missions, for example, regularly need replacement parts that must now either be carried onboard or shipped from Earth as needed. This can be challenging; space missions have strict limits on on-board weight and cargo room, and a shipment blasted into orbit can cost $22,000 per kilogram of payload. A 3D printer could offer a faster and relatively inexpensive way to manufacture parts on-site, and on-demand. After successfully testing a prototype in 2014, the US-based company Made In Space installed the International Space Station’s first commercial 3D printer in 2016. The printer is operated from the ground, so that astronauts only need to remove parts from the print bed once they are completed. More than 100 plastic parts had been printed aboard the International Space Station as of early 2019, including tools and medical equipment. The printing of metal parts is expected sometime in the next few years. 3D printing may play a more crucial role in future missions, including long expeditions, and ultimately even in the potential colonization of the moon and Mars. 3D printers will be needed to manufacture large parts and entire habitats in the vacuum of space - probably using local materials like dirt or regolith (the inorganic material covering the surface of a planet). One such project, called Archinaut, is currently being developed by Made In Space in cooperation with NASA. In addition to printing new parts including satellite reflectors, Archinaut is designed to repair existing machines and structures while in orbit.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.0"
"4.5","5G Business Model Transformation","","5G is a potential game changer for a number of industries, though they will have to adapt their business models in order to harness its true potential. The technology will initially exist as an overlay on existing 4G networks, and will likely only start achieving meaningful scale sometime in the early 2020s. Some important services made possible by 5G will include “digital twin” technology that creates a digital mirror of a physical object in order to predict its performance, augmented and virtual reality (thanks to better download and upload speeds), and predictive maintenance in factories. 5G is also expected to support high-density autonomous vehicle platooning (to improve aerodynamic performance and traffic flow), remote vehicle control, remote driver health monitoring, in-car infotainment, and smart traffic control. The energy sector could meanwhile use 5G for the real-time monitoring of utility networks with drones, sensing hazards and maintenance needs, and monitoring residential smart meters. Each individual use case has the potential to impact additional industries; autonomous vehicles will not only have an impact in the automotive sector, but may also impact the mobility space more broadly. The insurance industry, for example, may benefit as vehicle accident rates decrease. Ride-hailing platforms like Uber, Lyft, and Didi are expected transition within the next decade from human-driven, internal combustion engine cars to autonomous electric vehicles - potentially spawning millions of driverless cars on the roads, and potentially thousands of pilot-less vertical take-off and landing aircraft. An aggressive transition to self-driving vehicles is not a given, however. For such a transition to occur, political and regulatory support will be required. This will in turn largely determine the investment available for necessary infrastructure like vehicle charging stations and 5G connectivity. Intel has predicted the rise of a ""passenger economy"" worth $800 billion by 2035, as people in cars have more time on their hands to shop and secure everything from entertainment to doctors' appointments. As related technologies like artificial intelligence and virtual reality come to the fore, software companies and other industry players are expected to play a major role in designing new 5G business models. Those models will in turn rely on having a set of standardized regulations for 5G data monetization, related to cross-border data and services-sharing.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.1"
"4.6","5G Security and Critical Infrastructure","","5G networks can potentially create many new connections across a variety of services that have previously operated in relative isolation. They are also likely to dramatically expand the universe of devices connected to the internet, moving well beyond just computers and phones. This promises to create unprecedented risks - which need to be considered carefully by a broader set of stakeholders than ever before. In addition to the relatively low latency and enhanced broadband quality enabled by 5G networks, enhanced security support is also critical. Providers of basic, fundamental services will increasingly come to rely on 5G mobile networks to run operations and provide access to customers - ranging from obvious candidates such as financial services, which is already providing a vast array of products via mobile networks and devices, to less-obvious candidates such as healthcare and transportation providers who may now be able to offer a greater number of interconnected services that rely on high-speed mobile networks. Both the actual and perceived end-to-end security of 5G-related infrastructure, devices, and services will be key factors for the people, companies and public institutions pondering moving to 5G. Impending growth in the number of connected devices and a related proliferation of sensitive data demands comprehensive device- and cyber security measures. Results of a survey published by Gartner in late 2018 suggested that some two-thirds of all organizations had plans to deploy 5G by 2020 - mainly to power the Internet of Things and support video transmission. This makes it imperative that these organizations prepare for a fresh wave of cyber threats to be unleashed on an already-vulnerable environment. 5G infrastructure involves a lot of moving parts, from base stations to mobile backhaul (connecting different parts of a network), edge clouds (matching computing resources to high-traffic areas), and core networks, not to mention devices. According to an article published by the McKinsey Global Institute in 2015, the Internet of Things applications either in use or projected to be in use within a decade already had a potential $11 trillion economic impact annually. Backed by 5G network technology, these applications should spur both increasing demand and better network security.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.1"
"4.7","5G Spectrum and Network Needs","","Spectrum is oil for 5G networks, and a swift rollout will require that this oil is allocated efficiently to network operators. As private companies bulk up on necessary licensed and unlicensed spectrum, there is a need for regulators to zero in on the best ways to put it all to work. 5G requires relatively dense networks in order to meet coverage and capacity objectives. That means that most operators are taking a phased approach to network deployment, beginning with “non-standalone” architecture (using 5G cells with a legacy network) before transitioning to a standalone model. While automation could make 5G networks more efficient and agile, the mobile industry has made clear that a significant amount of new, harmonized mobile spectrum across key frequency ranges is needed - in order to avoid interference, and deliver faster speeds and broader coverage. Some of the potential scenarios for widescale use include public 5G networks, private and unlicensed 5G spectrum, network slicing of 5G spectrum, and privately-licensed 5G spectrum. Future networks will rely on a combination of mainstream and alternative technologies in order to make the best use of both licensed and unlicensed spectrum, across different bands. GSMA, a trade organization for mobile operators, has said the success of 5G is dependent on harmonizing mobile spectrum across three different frequency bands: both sub-1 GHz and between 1 and 6 GHz for coverage and capacity, and above 6GHz for very high data rates. These different bands will be necessary to address challenges related to dense urban areas and larger, more sparse regions. This will require 5G devices that support the different bands - initially sub-6GHz, and later on so-called millimetre wave spectrum found on the highest bands (which will be necessary to realize 5G’s true bandwidth potential). In addition to spectrum, fibre optic networks may play a significant role in the transition to 5G. However, it is expected that $150 billion will have to be invested in necessary fibre infrastructure in the US alone. 5G fibre optic networks can complement wireless networks in way that provides a better internet experience than either could muster on its own. Clearly, more reinforcement is needed to support the race to 5G, which is already pushing existing 4G networks to new limits by integrating new technologies - including those related to millimetre wave spectrum - according to the IEEE.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.1"
"4.8","5G Value Creation","","5G brings with it the possibility for fundamental industry change, by enabling a whole new set of services based on its strengths. If these services are properly enabled by the right mix of infrastructure and devices, they could create serious benefits for both governments and businesses; by the year 2035, 5G could enable an estimated $12.3 trillion in global economic value, according to a report published by IHS Markit, nearly equivalent to the value of all US consumer spending in 2016, and equal to more than all combined consumer spending in China, the United Kingdom, Japan, France, and Germany that year. Between 2020 and 2035, IHS Markit expects that 5G will contribute 0.2% of the average annual global GDP growth of 2.9%, a contribution equivalent to total current GDP in India, the world’s 7th-biggest economy. At a regional level, a European Commission report published in 2016 estimated that that 5G investment will help create 2.3 million jobs in European Union member states, while a study conducted by the Korea Telecom research institute KT EMRI has suggested that commercial use of 5G in South Korea may generate 47.8 trillion won ($42 billion) in local value. While this new value could be broadly distributed, certain industries may be able to unlock more of it than others as the first networks start rolling out - with features like enhanced mobile broadband connectivity and lower latency. A study conducted by the 5G Alliance for Connected Industries and Automation has estimated that digitalization-related revenue based on 5G at information and communications firms may exceed $1.2 trillion by 2026, of which approximately $234 billion would be accounted for by related manufacturing aspects. With government support, this commercial impact can have social benefits - as long as commitments are made to aligning industry goals with public-sector goals in the interest of socio-economic progress. For example, 5G could improve so-called “cooperative collision avoidance” for self-driving cars, by ensuring that information is passed among sensors on thousands of connected cars in the same area reliably and in real time - even in areas without network coverage. This could potentially help to reduce deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents, which are both a significant problem in many countries (annual worldwide road traffic deaths reached 1.35 million in 2018, according to the World Health Organization) and a potential impediment for industries banking on the mainstream use of self-driving vehicles.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.1"
"4.9","A $5 Trillion Economy","","India had the world’s seventh-largest economy and a GDP of $2.7 trillion as of 2018, according to the World Bank, and it aims to build a $5 trillion economy by 2024. However, it must now do so amid a slowing global economy and worsening international trade friction. India has several structural advantages at the moment: a relatively young population in an ageing world; a high rate of domestic savings (though this has declined from its peak before the global financial crisis in 2008); a large domestic consumer market (the total population is about 1.3 billion) that offers a buffer against weak global demand; and, traditional structural constraints such as food shortages and energy shocks that have upset economic stability in the past but have now eased significantly. As China’s economic growth slows over the next decade, India is likely to become the fastest-growing major economy in the world. It also has a rare opportunity - that it has failed to grab so far - to get into the global manufacturing game as supply chains are rewired as a result of the ongoing trade war between the US and China. However, there are significant headwinds. Private sector investment in India has been weak since the early years of this decade, due to excessive corporate borrowing and weak balance sheets at banks (the “twin balance sheet” problem). Consumer spending has been losing momentum, as incomes (rural and urban) have come under pressure. A high budget deficit meanwhile casts a persistent shadow over macroeconomic stability. After a decade of high inflation, pricing pressure has eased - retail inflation has been contained below 4% for more than two years, and India is no longer a global inflation outlier. The Reserve Bank of India also has more than $400 billion of foreign exchange reserves as insurance against sudden global financial shocks. However, India will have to undertake a number of structural reforms to catalyse private investment, boost export growth, fix public finances, and reverse wage- and savings-stagnation. Potential solutions are well understood, from boosting infrastructure investment to easing business regulation and reforming taxation policies. Restrictive laws on land acquisition and labour are meanwhile lingering, albeit politically complicated, hurdles to boosting manufacturing growth. Ultimately, India will need a new wave of structural reform in order to remain on the fast track.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.77"
"4.10","A Better Path to Services","","Job creation is especially crucial for developing countries such as Pakistan, where population growth continually adds to the army of unemployed, and economic recoveries are frequently jobless. Between the 1990s and 2016, Pakistan implemented major structural economic changes. The agriculture-related share of GDP declined to 20% from 25% during the period, and manufacturing’s share dropped to 13% from 17%; meanwhile that of wholesale and retail trade rose to about 19% from 16%. Still, no major shift in terms of employment contribution has been made by any major sector of economy; the distribution of employment among agriculture, industry, and services has not changed significantly in the past 10 years, reflecting a lack of genuine structural transformation from a traditional, agriculture-based economy to one based on modern industry - at least, when it comes to job creation. The agriculture sector continues to absorb the majority of the labour force, while the share of employment attributed to industry has remained flat. This highlights one of the structural weaknesses of Pakistan’s economic transformation: the country’s economy has been moving from agriculture-based to services-based, without first consolidating its industrial sector. This is likely one of the reasons for so much of the potentially active labour force in the country remaining unemployed (Pakistan’s unemployment rate was 6.1% as of early 2019, according to International Monetary Fund data). Manufacturing has the capacity to provide jobs for people with a broad range of skills, and can therefore potentially absorb greater numbers of workers than the service sector. The bypassing and neglect of manufacturing therefore created less room for job creation on the one hand, and weakened industrial foundations of the economy on the other. Much needs to be done yet in order to secure the future of textile manufacturing, for example, related to the consistency and cost of its supply of energy, and to the development of skills needed for greater innovation. Most importantly, the future of the country's manufacturing sector depends on how efficiently Pakistan can move towards export promotion-led growth and development. A well-organized plan for product diversification could also contribute to future growth - though that would require a massive paradigm shift in terms of policy-making. The focus of any related effort must be on small and medium-sized enterprises, as they have the greatest potential for job creation.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.105"
"4.11","A Digital Future","","Amid the sputtering of Australia’s natural resources boom, the country’s government has placed a high priority on a new generation of digital technologies, and aims to boost prosperity by maximizing private and public cyber capabilities. In 2016, the government launched an AUD 230 million Cyber Security Strategy, in order to subsidize partnerships among the government, the corporate sector, and university research centres both within Australia and overseas, and to develop resilience to malicious cyber activity. Government initiatives have included a collaboration between the Australian National University and the Department of Defence’s Australian Signals Directorate, which is designed to expand the qualified cyber security workforce. The government has also centralized cyber security resources formerly scattered across the Department of Defence, the Attorney General’s Department, the Australia Security Intelligence Organisation, the Australian Federal Police, and the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission. The resulting Australian Cyber Security Centre acts as a hub for intelligence gathering and sharing, and aims to educate through the publication of cyber security guidelines, a website with a free Threat Alert app, and free cyber security health checks for the country’s largest corporations and organizations.  In 2017, the Australian Cyber Security Centre issued its most recent cyber threat report. While the cyber damage done in Australia to date has been relatively minimal, the report warns that the constant upgrading of hackers’ techniques and tools, the proliferation of malware, and the failure of many Australians to employ even the most straightforward security measures could make the country a bigger target for cyber theft. The centre’s report also warns of the increased harvesting of log-in details and account numbers from smartphones and third-party service providers, and notes that foreign governments possess the greatest capacity to compromise Australian networks; the report noted that the centre had detected extensive related activity during the previous twelve months. With regard to the potential economic benefits of digital technologies, the Australian government is funding related projects to improve the liveability, productivity, and sustainability of cities and towns. In 2017, the national Smart Cities and Suburbs programme allocated AUD 28.5 million to schemes including the development of eco-conscious community spaces, resilient energy and water systems, automated traffic management, and the reduction of urban impacts on the Great Barrier Reef. However, it remains unclear whether the Australian government’s embrace of emerging technologies will achieve promised goals.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.14"
"4.12","A Just Transition","","The concept of a “just transition” was originally developed by labour unions in the 1990s, to describe providing support for workers who had lost their jobs due to environmental protection policies. It has since morphed into a widely promoted means to secure shared prosperity, while also protecting the environment. In the lead-up to the Paris Agreement on climate change negotiated in 2015, unions and their allies successfully lobbied to get prominent text on a just transition into the agreement, according to a report published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 2017. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals also reflect the agenda of just transition, according to the report, which noted positive, related developments including renewable energy being on track to account for half of the European Union’s energy supply by 2030, and the renewable energy industry’s employment of more than 8 million people worldwide as of 2015. In general, a just transition will shift employment out of carbon-intensive sectors, and create good, new alternative jobs - particularly in low-income areas (it also involves limiting increases for energy costs, in the interest of low-income families). Perceptions of the legitimacy of dramatically shifting to high-technology, low-carbon, and environmentally-sustainable economic models will be influenced by the extent to which this is done in an inclusive way. This should be a key consideration not just for policy-makers, but also for business leaders, technology developers, and environmental experts. There is some evidence that policy-makers in different countries have started taking this factor into account as they make efforts to transition economies. For example, China spent the equivalent of about $3.4 billion in 2017 on resettling nearly 400,000 workers who had been laid off due to government efforts to reduce the country’s steel and coal production capacity, as part of broader efforts to deal with supply gluts in each sector. In addition, in 2016, the Canadian government announced that as part of its accelerated phasing out of traditional coal power it would work with provinces and labour organizations to ensure that affected workers are successfully included in the transition to a low-carbon economy.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.48"
"4.13","A New Aerospace Era","","Drones are expected to play an increasing role in the logistics, security, and defence sectors, due to their cost-effectiveness, the minimal risk they pose to personnel, and the ability to gain a proverbial eye-in-the-sky when it comes to observation and monitoring. The potentially pivotal role that drones can play in revolutionizing personal transportation cannot be overstated, particularly as we see smarter, autonomous flight control systems gradually put into place. Cities such as Dubai and Singapore are actively looking into how personal drones can provide alternative modes of urban transportation, while also playing key roles in medical emergencies and logistics. The companies Ehang and Volocopter have successfully test flown their personal transportation drones, which is a critical step towards gaining public acceptance. However, improvements in terms of battery technology and regulation are needed, in order to facilitate more widespread adoption. In addition to drones, high-speed travel also promises significant potential change for the aerospace industry. Both supersonic (faster than the speed of sound) and hypersonic (more than five times the speed of sound) flights are starting to become more feasible (following the recent absence of availability of commercial, supersonic flight), as oil prices remain relatively low and related technology improves. Boom, for example, is a company looking to bring back supersonic travel for the commercial market. Meanwhile Reaction Engines, another private firm, is working on technology that one day could allow hypersonic speed and space flight, thanks to a hybrid, air breathing rocket engine. In terms of space travel, the re-usability of rockets means that it is becoming economically feasible to look forward to mass space tourism, as well as other ideas that until recently were confined to science fiction, like asteroid mining. Sub-orbital, point-to-point space flights for civilian purposes may also be a common reality soon, as the potential to leave some of Earth’s gravity behind in a financially non-prohibitive way has been demonstrated by the company Virgin Galactic; for $250,000, it is now possible to book a trip into orbit and back, and the first such trip is expected to take place sometime in 2018. In addition, while space mining is still a number of years away, private companies including Planetary Resources are hoping that by 2030 they will be making exploratory missions to nearby asteroids.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.5"
"4.14","A New Social Contract","","Every previous industrial revolution was tempered by the fact that it exposed individuals and societies to serious risks. However, it was technological progress that enabled us to deal with this situation, as it helped us to improve risk management practices. Now, the inter-connectedness of the technologies underpinning the Fourth Industrial Revolution calls for new approaches in order to effectively address potentially far-reaching and negative impacts. When it comes to advanced materials, however, a consensus is needed before we can make progress on addressing related ethical issues; while there is ample evidence of interest in addressing the ethical considerations of artificial intelligence and robotics, for example, the case may be different when it comes to the development of the materials that are used in cutting-edge devices. A transparent and conscientious consideration of human safety (for example, regarding physical or chemical toxicity, and radiation exposure levels) is needed at every stage of the materials development lifecycle. Social risks in particular deserve consideration. The progress that has been made in developing lithium-ion battery technology necessary for electric vehicles, for example, cannot obviate the basic human rights of children being exploited in cobalt mines in sub-Saharan Africa in order to make this development possible. In addition, any agricultural crops that are grown for materials production may ultimately pose a risk to biodiversity. And, the rapid development of energy processes based on nuclear transformations should not take the focus off of bolstering the safety systems that are needed to protect communities located in the vicinity of reactors. Adequately addressing related risks to air and water quality, and to the integrity of food systems, requires a truly systemic view.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.4"
"4.15","A New Supply Story","","New, unconventional resources like shale gas and light tight oil in the US, oil sands in Canada, extra heavy oil in Venezuela, and deep water resources in Brazil - not to mention the opening up of energy markets in Mexico and elsewhere to foreign investment - have blunted concerns about an impending peak in oil supply. The application of new technology has played a key role in driving all of these developments, and one result is that the West is now home to the bulk of new resource opportunities. These new sources of supply will increasingly help the countries exploiting them to compete for global market share with incumbent suppliers like Russia and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). This trend, coupled with growing demand in Asia, promises to transform the global oil and gas trade, and energy-related geopolitics. Despite the expansion of the potential supply portfolio, however, the future of global oil and gas remains riddled with uncertainty. Concerns have been raised about the adequacy of capital investment in new production needed to offset depletion in existing fields and meet new demand, for example; short-term price spikes are always a risk if production is insufficient to meet demand. In the longer term, if competition from alternative energy sources (such as renewables) threatens future oil demand, it may lead producers to rush to monetize existing reserves by accelerating production - and as a result hinder the availability of capital needed to fund new projects. That in turn could also drive down oil prices, encourage more oil use, and undermine environmentally-friendly policy efforts (this scenario even has a proper name: the “Green Paradox”). Taken together, all of these issues paint a picture of future oil supply and demand dynamics likely to generate periods of heightened market volatility.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.104"
"4.16","A New Way to Probe DNA","","In order to determine if a particular DNA sequence variant contributes to a disorder or disease state, modern genomics has mostly depended on statistical methods - which show a correlation between a sequence variant and a disease. However, the next, big step in the genomic revolution will be the direct testing of sequence variants in appropriate biological organisms, to determine the effects on these organisms. This new testing approach includes sequence variants that are being investigated for the primary causation of genetic disease, as well as for genetic modifiers (genes that can affect or interfere with other genes). The investigation of genetic modifiers in particular can enable us to better understand the variation (in terms of clinical severity) of a wide variety of disorders. This information in turn has enormous potential to help determine which affected individuals should be aggressively targeted for therapeutic intervention, and which should instead receive minimal, or even no intervention. CRISPR technology, used for gene editing, has meanwhile enabled the rapid introduction of genetic variants into multiple organisms. Mammalian cell lines, simple model organisms such as yeast, algae, worms, fruit flies, mouse cells, and stem cells that can regenerate indefinitely, will all be essential for this approach. They may foster a deeper understanding of how putative sequence variants perturb cellular homeostasis, while revealing novel targets for therapeutic intervention and opening up entirely new areas of biological investigation.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.109"
"4.17","A Political Voice for the Young","","More than half of the respondents in the World Economic Forum’s most recent Global Shapers Survey, a measure of how young people see the world, said they feel their views are not being considered before important decisions are being made. Sentiment varied according to region; asked if they agree with the statement “In my country, young people’s views are considered before important decisions are taken,” nearly 66% of young people in Latin America and the Caribbean disagreed, followed by 61.9% in Europe. According to respondents, the most important means for empowering young people are a healthy start-up ecosystem and entrepreneurship, access to the internet, a free press, and social media. In terms of the institutions that have managed to win the highest levels of trust from young people, academic institutions were the clear winner, followed by “your employer,” and international organizations. National governments earned the least amount of trust, according to the survey, with the bulk of that distrust coming from the Latin American and Caribbean region; this appears to be tied to perceptions of corruption. In response to the question “What frustrates you the most about government leaders in your country?”, abuse of power and corruption received the highest number of votes in the survey. When it comes to the most important ways that governments can demonstrate transparency and accountability, fighting corruption was by far the top response in the survey, followed by protecting the independence of the judiciary, and regular and open dialogue with citizens (respondents from countries classified as “mostly corrupt” in Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index for 2016 expressed the strongest appreciation of fighting corruption as a means to demonstrate accountability, at 60.3%). The public sector should take the lead in terms of providing social services like healthcare, education, and social security - as opposed to having these things privately run - according to the young people surveyed. The strongest opposition to privately-run public services came from Europe and North America, while Eurasia was the only region where young people believe the private sector should supply these services. When it comes to refugees, more than half of the young people surveyed said governments should try to include refugees in the national workforce; this reflected a generally empathetic attitude towards refugees expressed by young people both in this and in other parts of the survey.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.136"
"4.18","A Precise Approach to Prevention","","Simplified problem solving can result in incomplete solutions, when it comes to complex biological or life science-related phenomena. By way of contrast, systems science methods assess complex problems comprehensively, by analysing interactions that influence or predispose the ways that living things are built and function. The need for systems-based approaches is particularly pressing when it comes to evaluating factors that influence human health and well-being - because the onset of disease is usually the result of a complex interplay of factors including individual genomic profile, clinical phenotype (or the interaction between a genetic makeup and the environment), behaviour, social conditions, and the environment. The delivery of Precision Medicine should involve not only more precise approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of disease, but also to the prevention and control of related factors prior to the onset of disease. As our ability to measure factors that impact health and well-being improves, we must also develop systems-based scientific techniques that help us understand how data can be used to better support health and wellness. A genuinely improved understanding will require multi-disciplinary approaches that cross organizational boundaries, and the application of biomedical informatics and data science theories and methods. In addition, the incentives and drivers underpinning current healthcare delivery models will need to be realigned, in order to better engage care providers in the promotion of health and well-being that goes beyond hospitals and clinics. Ultimately, the use of systems science to deliver personalized approaches to health promotion should disrupt the current healthcare delivery system, lead to better outcomes, and reduce the fiscal and social burdens associated with disease.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.109"
"4.19","A Secure Africa","","Some African nations are grappling with security situations that threaten both the safety of their citizens, and their economic promise. From the Gulf of Guinea and the Sahel to the Horn of Africa, there have been numerous incidents including abductions, piracy, and the trafficking of humans and drugs. The Islamist Boko Haram insurgency continues to carry out attacks in countries including Nigeria roughly a decade after its emergence, creating fear and instability. In early 2019, the UN Refugee Agency reported that in a matter of days more than 35,000 people had recently been forced to flee from Boko Haram attacks in and around Rann, Nigeria, many of whom sought refuge in Cameroon's Makary District. Since 2009, more than 2.5 million people have been forced from their homes in the Lake Chad Basin as a result of Boko Haram-related violence, according to the agency (an attack by the group in the Nigerian village Dalori in January 2016, for example, ranked as the 16th most fatal incident during that year and caused 88 deaths). Somalia’s al-Shabaab terror group has meanwhile staged attacks in Kenyan shopping malls, schools, and universities, and has stirred a crisis that has spilled over into Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Uganda. In addition, towns in northern Mali have come under the control of militant Islamist group Ansar Dine, which sought to impose Sharia law across the country - spurring military intervention from France. Politically-motivated violence in Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo has also been a cause for concern. Extreme poverty, poor governance, institutional weakness, ineffective criminal law enforcement, and insecure borders are all factors that have contributed to fragility in Africa during an era of radicalism and migration. All African governments need to invest in reforms to better prevent instability, even during times of relative peace. Making local and state governments more accountable, fighting corruption, and eventually redeveloping blighted territories should ultimately help to curtail terrorist activity.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.6"
"4.20","A Social Contract for Mining","","Obtaining full license to operate from local communities has been a challenge for the mining industry. Many proposed projects have been rejected, and operations have been disrupted by protests. A greater global awareness about the impacts on people living near mine sites has resulted from advances in communication technologies, a mobilization of indigenous populations, and broader shared experience through international organizing. New operating models have to be developed to counterbalance negative trends only likely to get worse for the industry: using taxpayer money for remediating (cleaning up) the record number of mine sites now nearing the end of their life will further increase resentment; new mining projects meant to satisfy rising global demand for resources will aggravate the impact of mining on the environment; new projects will likely provide fewer local jobs and procurement opportunities due to the automation of the sector (which may in turn collide with the implementation of local regulations and requirements); and global warming, related water stress and extreme weather events may lead to more of the environmental accidents that are a primary concern of communities near mine sites. In addition, the profit shifting and transfer pricing practices (where a company uses loopholes to lighten its tax burden) that minimize the tax revenue the mining sector provides to governments in countries that are home to mines are increasingly causing reputational damage. Mining companies with a good track record as far as paying their taxes, community engagement, and environmental practices will generally have a competitive advantage when it comes to developing new projects. More specifically, business models that lead to lasting benefits at the local level will be key, as will finding synergies with other sectors that are big employers in any given region. In many mining regions, for example, agriculture is vital - and shared water infrastructure solutions that not only benefit a mine, but also serve surrounding communities and farmers, have brighter prospects (co-ownership models where communities benefit from mining operations in other ways are also being explored). Other means to help ensure the sustainability of a region following a mine closure could include installing renewable power projects on remediated land, or continued biomining (using microbes to extract metals from mine waste).","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.99"
"4.21","A Young Take on Global Issues","","More than 91% of the nearly 25,000 respondents in the World Economic Forum’s most recent edition of the Global Shapers Survey, a measure of how young people see the world, believe science has established that humans are responsible for climate change. In addition, nearly half identified climate change and the destruction of natural resources as the single biggest challenge now facing the world. Also high on the list of concerns: large-scale conflict, inequality, and corruption. Corruption is actually viewed by young people as a primary source of inequality, according to the survey (respondents of all income levels, except for “high” income respondents, saw corruption as the main source of inequality, while those in the “high” income category saw income levels as the number one source). When asked who has the greatest responsibility to make the world a better place and the power to address important issues, respondents’ first choice was “individuals” (34.2%), followed closely by “government” (29%). The distant third-place choice, “international organizations,” received just 9% of votes. However, even against a backdrop of mounting challenges for multilateral, international organizations, roughly 70% of respondents said they believe it is important that their government take an active role in addressing other countries’ issues. Interestingly, North America was the only region where most young people rated the need for their government to take an active role in addressing other countries’ issues as “extremely” important (respondents from Eurasia placed the least amount of importance on this). Respondents were also asked whether they would be willing to change their lifestyle in order to better protect the environment - 78.1% responded “yes,” and only 1.8% said “no”; respondents from Latin America and South Asia were the largest blocs of “yes” voters. More than 80% of the young people surveyed said they have taken a highly or indirectly active role in helping to achieve the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, which were adopted in 2015 in order guide global development through 2030. However, not all respondents were aware of the goals. In general, though, the findings of the survey support the idea that young people are socially conscious, and concerned about the distribution of wealth, political tension, and the state of the world more generally.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.136"
"4.22","AI Education and Awareness","","Technology innovation in the realm of robotics and artificial intelligence is fundamentally transforming education, and updating the skills required to succeed in workplaces and classrooms. Building future-ready education systems requires curricula fit for the 21st century, and the consistent delivery of freely-available education for everyone. In Finland, for example, a free online course, “Elements of AI,” designed by the consulting firm Reaktor and the University of Helsinki, has garnered more than 130,000 registered students - and is intended to gradually educate larger swathes of the population about artificial intelligence in a bid to repurpose the economy for a new era. While specialized education should provide in-demand skills for new and existing workers, and address the disconnect between employer needs and existing instruction, public awareness must also be built regarding the impact of AI and robotics on the lives of ordinary people - and regarding its proper usage. Regardless of their age or socio-economic background, people must be empowered to engage with artificial intelligence and robotics and harness them to their advantage. When it comes to jobs that are dangerous and take a heavy toll on physical well-being, artificial intelligence and robotics can play a helpful role. However, there is a danger of increasing job loss due to automation. In England alone, about 1.5 million jobs are at high risk of being at least partially-automated, according to a report published by the Office for National Statistics in 2019. The three occupations with the highest risk of automation are waiters, shelf fillers and elementary sales roles, according to the report. This threat calls for a rethinking of social security nets, as well as an effort to re-skill workers. Meanwhile young people must be inspired to master technology and to pursue work in related fields (and adjacent areas), while people in general need to become able to trust the technology that surrounds them - by better understanding its implications and practical uses. They must also be educated about those parts of AI systems where humans are still involved (the so-called hidden economy of AI), in order to blunt undue fear and hype.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.12"
"4.23","AI Ethics and Values","","It is increasingly evident that artificial intelligence systems can perpetuate historic biases, discriminate, and be used in ways that threaten human rights and democratic values (for example, image recognition technologies mis-categorize black faces, sentencing algorithms discriminate against black defendants, and chatbots can easily adopt racist and misogynistic language, according to a report published by the research institute AI Now in 2019). There are currently more than 40 sets of ethical guidelines and principles for artificial intelligence in use in the world, which attempt to distil what values we can agree on - and advise on how best to implement them into institutional frameworks, technical research and applications, and regulations. The European Union, for example, published its “Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI” in 2019, which includes requirements such as the transparency of related business models and the fostering of diversity. Ultimately, artificial intelligence is a multi-use technology that could drastically improve and prolong healthy lives, as and help us tackle some of our most difficult global challenges - and it is unlikely to be contained by national borders.   That means that we must ensure that global use of artificial intelligence adheres to a shared value system (while being mindful of the potential for tensions and trade-offs stemming from the overlap of competing systems). Values inform our collective judgments about what is important, factor into our decision-making, and provide a crucial anchor amidst the technology-fuelled upheaval of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. One of the key areas of artificial intelligence where values must be applied is data governance; the data used as fuel for AI systems should be acquired in a way that does not come at the expense of consumer privacy, and the type of data being used to make predictions should be transparent, according to an article published by McKinsey & Company in 2019. An example cited in the article is a healthcare provider buying data about its patients from a broker, including information about which restaurants they frequent and how much TV they watch, in order to assess health risk. While the healthcare provider might believe this is in the best interest of patients, those patients might see it as an invasion of privacy.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.12"
"4.24","AI Safety, Security and Standards","","Artificial intelligence systems may pursue goals that are different from what their designers intended, and cause unintended harm. For example, social media algorithms intended to increase engagement, and digital news algorithms intended to increase readership, may contribute to political polarization, misinformation, and internet addiction. The algorithms powering YouTube have come under related scrutiny, amid growing realization that the site’s artificial intelligence tends to channel viewers to videos that have proven to be both highly-engaging and filled with erroneous claims and outrage peddling related to everything from how the Titanic “really” sank to anti-vaccination conspiracy theories, according to a report published in Scientific American in 2019. Other potential AI-related dangers come in the form of military drones operating without human control, which can cause unintentional to harm non-combatants. Clearly, artificial intelligence should be created and deployed with caution - and specialists and experts in the field should be educated in ethics. Meanwhile clearer standards for the industry that emphasize accountability should be considered (in terms of killer drones, or Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems, many have advocated for the development and deployment of clear restrictions on government and military use). Given that many artificial intelligence-related threats are unprecedented in scope, it will be necessary to update and amend both national and international regulation. In the US, the White House issued an executive order in 2019, “Maintaining American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence,” that focuses on developing related technical standards, and California has adopted legislation supporting the Asilomar AI Principles including those related to safety - while several European countries are pushing for certification requirements for AI applications. AI can be used maliciously to target individuals, automate spear phishing attacks in a way that increases yield and decreases costs, and create realistic (but fake) online videos in a bid to incite public scandal and chaos. The list of other potential misuses is long: modifying traffic signs; using drones to spy, make assassination attempts (as occurred in Venezuela in 2018) or ground flights; and using bots to influence elections. As AI systems become more capable, related problems will have a larger impact. In the most extreme scenario, systems will entirely rid themselves of their human operators; in general, experts believe there is a 50% chance that artificial intelligence will outperform humans at everything in about 45 years.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.12"
"4.25","AI and Machine Learning","","Artificial intelligence and machine learning, or the ability of computers to self-learn, are enabling autonomous flight planning for drones, and making the data they collect both useful and actionable. Taking the person physically out of an aircraft enables innovative flight characteristics; so does taking the person out of the decision making process behind a drone’s launch. Autonomous aircraft manufacturers like Airobotics, Matternet, and Google envision a future where flights are planned and executed by algorithms, which can optimize routes based on the risk posed to people and the weather. As airspace becomes more congested, prioritization and performance must be augmented by artificial intelligence - which, alongside machine learning, is among the most important enabling technologies for drones as their use and economic impact increase. As a sensor platform, drones often provide data in quantities greater than people can efficiently process. The fast, automated analysis of this new aerial data can provide farmers with immediate recommendations for how to apply fertilizers, chemicals, or water, or inform park rangers about where poachers of endangered species are headed. It can also enable infrastructure inspections that can recognize metal fatigue and irregularities, before they become a problem.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.42"

"4.27","Accelerating Sustainability","","Making production systems now responsible for significant carbon dioxide emissions more sustainable is critical for fighting climate change, and for ensuring the right kind of future economic growth. The so-called circular economy, or an economy designed around production and consumption that produce zero waste through reuse and recycling, provides a model that can help the manufacturing sector contribute to broader global sustainability. Examples of production that have employed circular economy practices include the construction of facilities for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London - like buildings and bridges designed for deconstruction and later use, and the use of leftover gas pipelines in the Olympic stadium’s structure, according to a report published by the think tank CEPS in 2017. Related technology advancements and further organizational innovation could boost resource productivity (the amount of value that can be wrung from a single resource), and create new economic value. Leaders of governments, businesses, and non-governmental organizations all must play a role in making this shift to circular principles happen - particularly in light of the potentially dire consequences of the current rate of climate change. About half of the world’s total energy consumption and about 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions are attributed to the manufacturing sector - sustainable production has to become the global standard as soon as possible. Businesses can nudge consumers towards more sustainable models of consumption, by selling durable products that can be used for longer periods. Policy-makers can implement rules that reduce the price difference between sustainable products and potentially more affordable alternatives, and support sustainable production with tools such as taxes levied on goods made at facilities with large carbon footprints. Meanwhile public procurement policies can help by requiring a minimum amount of secondary (re-purposed) raw materials in products purchased by governments. In addition, providing a standard way for companies to report their sustainable activities could help them better gauge their effectiveness, while regulations that encourage the consumer use of sustainable products, such as permitting electric cars to use bus lanes in congested city centres, can help increase demand. production requires a sufficient number of manufacturers and consumers willing and able to use recycled materials.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.3"
"4.28","Access and Adoption","","While the pace of technological development, adoption, and transformation is accelerating for many people, the world is still a long way from being able to ensure universal access to internet services. Only slightly more than half of the world’s population, or 51.2%, was using the internet as of the end of 2018, according to the International Telecommunications Union. In recent years, according to the ITU’s report The State of Broadband 2018: Broadband Catalyzing Sustainable Development, hitherto strong internet growth rates have actually begun to level out, as networks reach near-ubiquity in densely populated areas. Substantial digital divides persist between more- and less-connected countries and communities. Connecting everyone in the world to the internet and removing these divides remains a challenge that needs to be addressed, if we are to achieve the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals - which were established in 2015 in order to guide global development until 2030. Only with efficient and affordable information and communication technology infrastructure and services, and the right digital capabilities, language ability, and soft skills like teamwork, can individuals and businesses actively participate in the digital economy. New forms of cooperation among stakeholders including tech and non-tech companies, ICT and finance ministries, investors, and international financial organizations could help to better align incentives in order to achieve digital goals - and to enable countries to increase their overall economic well-being and competitiveness. Priorities for collaboration: Adopting or revising fiscal policies Allocating the spectrum needed for wireless internet access in timely and efficient way Developing ambitious national broadband plans Unlocking Universal Service and Access Funds (public funds dedicated to expanding internet access) Finding ways to scale up innovation that can increase internet access and use","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.40"
"4.29","Access to Care","","At least half of the world’s population cannot obtain essential health services, and large numbers of households are pushed into poverty every year because they have to pay for health care out of their own pockets, according to a report published in late 2017 by the World Bank and the World Health Organization. About 800 million people spend at least 10% of their household budgets on health expenses, according to the report, and for nearly one in eight of those people the expenses are high enough to push them into extreme poverty - defined as living on just $1.90 or less a day. Physical environments can dictate diverse healthcare needs that change over time, while population trends related to demographics, disparities, and culture can shape system access, regulation, and utilization. Ageing populations in Europe, Japan, and the US, for example, are re-shaping healthcare systems. According to a review of Japan’s health system published by the WHO in 2018, Japan’s “demographic dilemma” requires drastic reform of healthcare and long-term-care systems; health expenditures for those aged 65 and above in Japan is 4.3 times higher than for other age groups, according to the report, and the majority of costs are being covered by the working class population through taxes and medical insurance premiums. In order to better address the needs of its greying population, Japan introduced Long-term care insurance in 2000, to support the elderly and promote independence (between its implementation and 2013, the number of elderly certified as requiring care under the program doubled to 5.69 million, raising questions about its sustainability). In Germany, where the population is also ageing at a dramatic rate, foreign workers are being more aggressively recruited to staff homes for the elderly; hundreds of thousands of additional workers are estimated to be required to fill gaps. The 2017 report from the World Bank and WHO that warned of uneven access to care also contained some encouraging elements. For example, the report noted that the number of people able to obtain key health services such as immunization, family planning, and bed nets to prevent malaria has actually increased during the first years of the 21st century. However, these developments have been uneven across the world, according to the report, with areas like sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia suffering from significant gaps in availability.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.71"
"4.30","Access to Law and Justice","","More than half of the people in the world lack reasonable access to legal information, assistance, and institutions. The United Nations has estimated that 4 billion impoverished people must go without a reasonable means to protect their rights to property, income, security, and government services. This represents a failure of legal infrastructure, and it is a crisis; people are being robbed of dignity, safety, and their fair share of social benefits. The crisis hobbles economic development, because without secure access to legal infrastructure, economies cannot grow. The international community recognized that access to the infrastructure of justice is critical for growth, through the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals established in 2015 (Goal 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions). Providing citizens with the basic infrastructure needed to manage family, housing, land and other matters is critical. As studies conducted by the Hague Institute for the Innovation of Law have documented, in dozens of countries relatively few people have access to the legal frameworks and legal assistance needed to resolve matters peacefully and reliably. International commitments to building robust infrastructure to meet these legal needs will be critical for achieving a number of UN Sustainable Development Goals in addition to number 16. A lack of access to legal advice and institutions is not only a feature of life for the poor. It also describes the circumstances facing the majority of people in many advanced countries. In the US, more than 80% of individuals in court facing eviction, loss of contact with their children, a loss of access to child support, or the seizure of assets do so without legal representation or advice. Few can afford legal fees that average over $200 an hour. Even in the United Kingdom, which has historically generous legal aid schemes, cutbacks between 2010 and 2014 caused the number of people receiving advice or assistance in social welfare matters to drop by 90%. Legal needs surveys consistently find that at least half of the households in the US experience an average of two to three significant legal problems at any time, while millions of people on a daily basis click to agree to online terms and conditions that affect their privacy and employment - with little to no understanding of the implications. Rising inequality, and a sense of being disconnected from the law, each play a significant role in fuelling the instability of governments.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.90"
"4.31","Access to Resources","","As world-class mineral resources in low-risk areas are exhausted, mining companies must either master new technologies for extraction and processing - or venture into frontier areas where it has not previously been economically viable to extract. As a result, mining companies are increasingly automating processes in order to improve safety, increase productivity, and lower costs. In addition, better exploration technologies and geographic information system tools are enabling more targeted mining of higher-grade ore. As extraction becomes more efficient, it could become easier to re-process resources like tailings dams (used to store mining by-products). Recently, block caving - which enables access to deeper resources at a cost similar to that of open pit mining - has received increased attention as many open pit mines cease operations. Some technologies being tested could fundamentally alter mining; in-situ leaching, for example, dissolves minerals and extracts them through boreholes drilled into a deposit, while biomining uses microbes to extract metals from rock ores or mine waste. In addition, methods of deep sea mining and asteroid mining are being actively explored by governments and companies. As these technologies and techniques open up new possibilities for mining companies to optimize the valorization of existing resources, or enable access to new resources, they are moving the industry into uncharted territory in terms of business models, processes, and social and environmental consequences. As technologies mature, and the impacts of alternative mining models become clearer, new rules and regulations will have to be developed to address them. It is also essential to better recognize the early-stage companies around the world that are designing and deploying potentially helpful new technologies, as they will likely have significant impact both on the industry and on society as a whole; greater collaboration between traditional mining companies and startups has the potential to benefit local communities, clients, and investors by ensuring a safer and more sustainable industry. AngelList, a US-based website designed to help young companies attract funding, listed more than 90 “minerals” startups as of late 2018, including a company that develops a blockchain protocol for the more responsible tracking and sourcing of minerals, and another that develops 3D Printing applications for mining.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.99"
"4.32","Accessibility and Disability","","While accessible design that promotes independence can be enforced, informal and often erroneous assumptions about what constitutes accessibility persist in many places because of longstanding custom and tradition. Where no code exists, notions of accessibility vary - and generally come into existence without input from actual people with disabilities (inclusion is a process rather than an outcome, and participation is essential). In general, what makes for effective accessibility changes according to user, task, and environment. In addition, “accessible” design differs from “inclusive” design. While accessibility - to spaces both physical and virtual - is fundamental, it is also often confined to certain users as defined by economics or education, and therefore undermines the potential for equal participation. Inclusion, on the other hand, builds upon accessibility and goes further by accounting for unequal resources and barriers to participation. A truly inclusive strategy takes action to support participation - one example is the Smithsonian Institution’s deployment of technology in 2019 that provides verbal descriptions for museum visitors who are blind or have poor vision. “Disability” is only the currently-preferred term for basic human differences, and the very concept of inclusion is mutable because it is about creating new, unlikely relationships among entities and people. Real flexibility takes into account varying body types, cognitive capacities, communication styles, and other differences - and design for disability should therefore reject the sort of binary thinking represented by “normal/abnormal,” “able/disabled,” and “male/female,” and instead focus on achieving maximum access and usability. Inclusive design centres on users at the edges of usability, rather than on the norm, in order to help ensure fuller inclusion. One area of increasing significance in this regard is emergency events; marginalized populations are especially vulnerable to climate change-related emergencies, infrastructure failures, and violence, for example. The health and safety of disabled people must therefore be built directly into every possible response strategy. By preparing in advance for the participant whose bodily difference demands a reduction of impediments, inclusion is more easily achieved. This key issue was curated in partnership with Beth Ziebarth, Director of the Accessibility Program for the Smithsonian Institution and Katherine Ott, Curator in the Department of Medicine and Science at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.76"
"4.33","Active Ownership","","Banks and brokers are the most widely disparaged culprits behind the financial crisis, due to their short-termism and excessive risk taking. Yet, they were acting on behalf of large institutional investors who failed to effectively monitor their investments. Pension funds, endowments, insurers, and sovereign wealth funds should therefore share some of the blame, due to their passive corporate governance. In the future, they will hopefully act as better stewards of the companies they invest in by adopting a more active stance. A broader transition to active institutional ownership is gaining momentum, largely due to the extensive shedding of debt taking place in the corporate and financial spheres. By replacing debt with equity, investment managers are likely to become less inclined to maximize short-term results and instead focus on companies' long-term value creation. Norway’s $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund, for example, has clearly stated its expectations for the companies it invests in, in terms of corporate governance, shareholder rights, social issues, and the environment. The fund’s active ownership is a tool to both protect shareholders’ rights, and to benefit the people of Norway. Active ownership has implications for the relationship between asset owners and managers, with performance no longer hinging purely on short-term market benchmarking, but also on longer-term metrics like internal rates of return. The organizational impact of this will be profound, as layers of intermediaries are reduced, more reliance is placed on internal capabilities and in-house expertise, and fewer mandates are granted to external managers and funds of funds (a mutual fund, for example, that invests in other funds). Dedicated teams can more effectively operationalize an institution’s long-term mission, and improve corporate governance at the companies being invested in. In principle, the cost of active ownership is the increased volatility that results from more concentrated portfolios; diversification is widely considered the surest way to achieve better returns. However, institutional ownership of large stakes in companies could provide better monitoring, and more aligned incentives, without necessarily increasing risk thanks to so-called relationship investing - or actively investing for the long term, in exchange for some say in how a firm is run. Stewardship should matter to institutions that take the long view. Some asset managers may not welcome it, as it involves spending more effort and resources. However, until institutional investors start to behave like well-informed, responsible owners, managerial entrenchment will undermine the long-term prospects for finance capitalism.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.81"
"4.34","Adapting for Employees and Society","","The size of the total workforce at the top 12 global banks in trading, sales and research fell by more than one fifth between 2010 and 2018, according to data published by Coalition Development Ltd. As banks and other financial services firms have slimmed down, however, they have also poured more resources into mobile payments and other innovative technologies. That has led them to seek out talent in a way that puts them in direct competition with fast-growing, well-funded technology firms. It is unclear whether many young people would now opt for financial services over tech. A 2015 report based on a survey of young people conducted in more than a dozen countries by the research firm Universum noted that banking was still drawing students with relatively less interest in entrepreneurship and creativity than their peers headed to the technology industry; the report noted the general surprise when Capital One had lured away Google design executive Dan Makoski the prior year to the financial services industry, which some perceived as a “technology backwater” (Makoski subsequently moved on to Lloyds Banking Group).   While some banking and financial services jobs are replaced by more technology-focused work, others will disappear due to automation. Floor traders, for example, have dwindled; the number of traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange has fallen from about 5,000 in 2000, to roughly 1,000 (at most) on any given day, according to the US Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Companies have a responsibility to help workers facing displacement develop new skills, and to work together with the public sector to help displaced workers find other options. Banks also have an obligation to redirect more of their profits to causes that broadly benefit society. One way to do this is to focus on Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) factors (in 2018, the World Bank partnered with Japan’s Government Pension Investment Fund to help integrate ESG considerations into fixed income portfolios). In addition, banks and other firms should help expand financial inclusion via means like the mobile phone-based services now prevalent in Africa, where retail-banking penetration is still about half the global average for emerging markets (according to a McKinsey estimate). And, there is a lingering responsibility to bolster global financial literacy; only one in three adults in the world can be considered financially literate, according to results of a survey published by the Global Financial Literacy Excellence Center.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.52"
"4.35","Adaptive Leadership","","The opportunities presented by the Fourth Industrial Revolution can be fleeting and difficult to anticipate - making traditional organizational planning less relevant. Successful platform companies like Uber and Airbnb, which have helped to fuel the sharing economy, were able to achieve systemic impact with relatively few resources and in a relatively short period of time, for example. These companies have also quickly created new challenges for urban policy-makers and traditional industries, illustrating the need for both economic actors and public officials to monitor systemic change and to place a premium on reacting with agility. For example, some traditional consumer goods companies have sought to adapt to the threat posed by Amazon and Alibaba by offering hyper-customized shopping experiences; Nestle is piloting a progamme in Japan that collects DNA and blood samples, in order to sell food and beverage products that are personalized. An ability to experiment with, and pilot new ideas and designs is essential for adaptive leadership. According to a study published in 2017 by Deloitte, one way of developing this ability is to cultivate diverse and inclusive teams, where people feel empowered to speak up. The study found that this generates more and better ideas, and innovative ways of working. Examples of agile corporate leadership include Careem, the most widely-used ride-hailing app in the Middle East, North Africa and Pakistan, which has been able to differentiate itself from Uber by incorporating local norms and needs; the company’s leadership recognized the importance of women feeling safe when using the service, and the predominance of cash transactions in an under-banked region, for example. Piloting new ideas works most effectively when it is followed by a rigorous assessment of results. A “systems mindset,” which involves looking beyond the immediate impact of decisions in order to take into account all concerned stakeholders, can help to refine and sharpen initial ideas. An ability to self-correct is also key. History is filled with examples of leaders who failed to reverse course on ill-fated strategy - whether it was Kodak opting to not aggressively pursue digital photography, or US video rental chain Blockbuster passing on an opportunity to partner with then-nascent streaming service Netflix in 2000. On the other hand, Flickr is an example of successful adaptive leadership; it essentially started as a chat room space, but then evolved into the pure photo sharing platform that was acquired by Yahoo in 2005.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.93"
"4.36","Aerial Data Capture","","Drones will become a ubiquitous tool for industry, agriculture and resource management within the next decade, by combining precision sensors with analytics derived from machine learning - or, computers that can self-learn. Players from a multitude of industries are combining drone-derived data with existing workflows, in order to solve real problems. For example, unmanned aircraft are being combined with existing satellite networks to provide quick access to reliable geospatial mapping, agricultural recommendations, and infrastructure analysis. The ability to capture data has been the driving force behind early adoption of drone technologies, and the barriers to entry for drones in terms of price and operational complexity pale in comparison with those for satellite imaging, or manned aircraft. Infrastructure inspections done via drone that use thermographic displays can provide insights in order to prevent costly downtime on oil platforms, for example, or electrical grid outages. Data provided about agriculture can meanwhile reduce the impact of chemicals on the environment, increase crop yields to help fight the widening global food crisis, and identify pests before they can decimate production. The list of those using drones for aerial data capture is rapidly expanding to include insurers, first responders, telecommunications firms, and governments in need of population surveying, planning, or disaster relief.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.42"
"4.37","Aerospace's Digital Age","","The capture of massive datasets that can be analysed in order to optimize aircraft design, manufacturing, and automated flight control will have a tremendous impact on the aerospace industry. While a new world of flight control based on artificial intelligence and automation is within our grasp, serious questions were raised about airplane automation in early 2019, following the crash of a jet that appeared to follow a similar trajectory to a crash attributed to automation error roughly six months earlier. Cybersecurity, for both manned aircraft and drones, may also benefit from the use of big data - though it may also pose the greatest potential threat, at least when it comes to autonomous flight and air traffic management. Meanwhile the Internet of Things, which can tie devices and tools together via the internet, is expected to extend to aircraft components - where it can provide continuous, in-flight monitoring of system status. This may not only enable safer flights, but also provide a constant flow of real-time information about components to their manufacturers and maintenance crews. Satellite communication can potentially deliver larger amounts of bandwidth to an increasingly data-hungry world, encourage greater international communication, and even improve global relations. Making the world a smaller place via satellite technology enables information to be shared more quickly, for faster decision making and rapid information dissemination across urban and non-urban areas; connections can be provided to even the most remote locations, and at a fraction of current costs. With India now planning to launch one satellite per month, and private companies including SpaceX, Boeing, and OneWeb expecting to launch their own internet systems comprised of between 650 and 4,400 satellites each by 2024, the world promises to only get smaller and better-connected.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.5"
"4.38","African Agriculture and Innovation","","Sub-Saharan Africa is widely-considered the most vulnerable area of the world to the effects of climate change. This is due to the region’s high degree of dependence on natural resources, a warm climate, agricultural production that is largely reliant on rainfall, and low levels of precipitation. Africa’s vulnerability is further exacerbated by poverty, governance and institutional challenges, and limited access to capital, infrastructure, and technology. African women are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change; they shoulder an enormous portion of the burden of subsistence agriculture. Many African countries are already suffering from various forms of climate-related stress such as drought, floods, and rainfall variability. In addition to climate change, there are other megatrends compounding the agricultural and development challenges faced in these regions: demographic shifts, significant urbanization, and a need to develop greater technology and innovation capabilities. In terms of demographic trends in particular, sub-Saharan Africa may add more than one billion people between now and 2050, and could account for more than half of all global population growth during that time, according to a United Nations estimate published in 2019 - squeezing existing supplies of food, water, and energy. These megatrends present challenges, but they also offer opportunities to make progress on more sustainable and inclusive growth. Recent technology innovation can be leveraged to increase agricultural productivity; advances in seed technology, for example, have produced drought-resistant and high-yielding varieties. In addition, new land and water management techniques can be deployed to reduce the erosion of soil and increase the organic matter that it contains. Recently developed renewable energy technologies could also be used to power small-scale, electric-powered agricultural machinery, to pump water, and to provide small-scale irrigation and refrigeration. These technologies could significantly benefit smallholder farmers, who constitute the bulk of Africa’s labour force. Their increased output could boost their income, reduce poverty, and increase food security. However, the adoption of these new technologies is constrained by cost and uncertainty about necessary rainfall. There is therefore a strong case to be made for African governments to subsidize technology access. There is also a need for greater risk mitigation (and a related, increased ability on the part of farmers to take chances on new technologies) through the broader provision of crop insurance.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.6"
"4.39","Age-Friendly Infrastructure","","Global demographic shifts are creating a need for innovative programs and services that better enable older people, and benefit everyone. The World Health Organization’s (WHO) Age-friendly Cities and Communities program serves as the guiding framework for so-called “age-friendly” initiatives; its goal is to enable those who remain healthy and active to continue to participate in their communities, while providing support for those who cannot - with a focus on maintaining functional ability. This requires collaboration. “Age-Friendly NYC,” for example, is a partnership among the Office of the Mayor of New York City, the New York City Council, and the New York Academy of Medicine. It gathers feedback from thousands of older people across the city about their needs and priorities, in order to help identify the best initiatives and policies to maximize the participation of seniors. In the 2016 report Ageing and Urbanization: Principles for Creating Sustainable, Growth-Oriented and Age-Friendly Cities, the McGraw Hill Financial Global Institute and the Global Coalition on Aging built upon the WHO’s work, and identified principles for enhancing environments; the first involves improving infrastructure and transportation systems, to keep older people mobile and physically connected with their communities (preventing social isolation can aid the emotional and mental health of older individuals). Another principle in the 2016 report is the creation of housing that allows older adults to stay at home - known as “ageing in place.” This can help prevent a need for institutional care, while realizing savings for older adults, their families, and health care systems. As the global over-80 population expands dramatically in the decades to come, demand for ageing in place will increase. Access to information and services promoting prevention and wellness through community health programs is another principle outlined in the report, as these programs can promote healthy behaviour and empower individuals to take control of their health and longevity. Other principles included in the report include expanded access to work, education, arts, and recreation for citizens of all ages, in order to encourage new career paths. Cities have a corresponding need for infrastructure that facilitates the development of professional lives that last past traditional retirement age. Each age-friendly city will adapt these principles according to its own culture, economy, and growth objectives. All, however, must take action and start investing now, so that everyone can benefit from ageing and urbanization trends.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.7"
"4.40","Agency and Trust","","Biometrics, facial recognition, and multi-factor authentication (verifying a user with multiple credentials) help establish trust online - something becoming more difficult as cybercrime and the commercial exploitation of personal data increase. The same technology that improves verification can deplete trust. Artificial intelligence, for example, can be vulnerable to hijacking and discrimination. And while police in New Delhi were reportedly able to use facial recognition in 2018 to track down thousands of missing children within days, that same technology can be used for surveillance and oppression. People are demanding more agency over their data - to know more about how it’s being used, and to tailor it to their needs. Technology companies and governments are exploring decentralized identity systems that empower individuals in this way; Microsoft, Accenture, and Mastercard have announced plans to invest in decentralized models, Evernym and Learning Machine are creating self-sovereign, open-source solutions, and Malta’s government developed a way for educational institutions to issue blockchain-based academic credentials that are owned by students, portable, and instantly verifiable. By 2022, about 150 million people will have blockchain-based identities, according to IDC, even though the technology is still at a relatively early stage of development. Traditionally, governments or banks have played the role of “trust anchor,” though emerging digital identity models involve new actors. For example, Capsule Pharmacy, referred to as an “Uber for drugs,” relies on doctors as a source of trust when filling e-prescriptions for delivery. Several related governance efforts exist, such as the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework and the European Union’s implementation of an ethical AI strategy. However, the monopolization of technology platforms used for search and social media, and pervasive personal data gathering, complicate efforts to win digital trust; events like Cambridge Analytica’s illicit collection and use of Facebook user data for political advertising do not help matters. According to the Pew Research Center, 49% of American respondents to a 2018 survey did not trust the government to protect personal data, and 51% did not trust social media companies to do so. While internet users expect personalized experiences, they also expect security and agency over their personal data - something that promises to become a competitive differentiator among companies and organizations. Stakeholders in all sectors and industries should promote stewardship of good identity, place the user at the centre of identity systems, create collaborative governance mechanisms, and take interactions between human and non-human identities into consideration.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.41"
"4.41","Agile Technology Governance","","Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies can be harnessed by governments to govern better, become more accessible, and increase transparency and trust - not to mention better track public assets. Examples include the use of technologies like the Internet of Things in Barcelona to better monitor waste collection and conserve the electricity used for lampposts, and the Estonian government’s use of blockchain to secure national data and online services. However, technology can also create governance challenges, as advances in some cases threaten the social contract between government and the citizenry. The increased use of online social media, for example, has created situations where electorates are being manipulated and misinformed (new industries have been spawned specifically to deploy this sort of persuasion, exemplified by Cambridge Analytica, a firm that drew significant public attention in 2018 after it was suspended from Facebook’s platform for improperly receiving and retaining personal user data). Governments will be forced to change their approach when it comes to the creation and enforcement of regulation, and to create new instruments to cope with the spread of new technologies. Agile governance will involve governments finding ways to reinvent themselves in order to better understand what they are regulating; close collaboration with businesses and civil society will be necessary to make that happen. Becoming more agile should not be a frenetic, never-ending process for policy-makers, creating uncertainty. What is needed is not necessarily more, or faster policy-making, but rather regulatory and legislative environments that foster resilience to the uncertainty of social, economic, and technological shifts. The key will be to make deliberation more productive than it is now, and to create the maximum amount of space possible for future innovation. Putting agile governance into practice will involve understanding existing models and how they operate in specific social and political contexts, and looking for opportunities to harness new technologies and processes that can remove the bottlenecks in those models. Increased efficiency and effectiveness of consultation, improved transparency, and more flexibility on the part of regulators will be required. As the World Economic Forum's former Global Agenda Council on Software & Society argued, truly agile governance should take into account how new technologies affect job markets, money and taxation, liability, security, privacy, and inclusion - while assessing ways to remove power imbalances.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.55"
"4.42","Agility and Responding to Disruption","","Despite their market dominance and abundant resources, established businesses - including many family businesses - are increasingly uncertain about the future, and are struggling to adapt to the new reality of technological disruption. Many have missed out on growth opportunities, as they fail to match the speed of execution of new entrants. If they want to stay alive for generations, they need to actively address these issues before it is too late. Family businesses are not viewed as being particularly innovative. For them, innovation and developing new ways of creating value can be particularly challenging. Family tradition, and a family’s emotional attachment to a founder’s legacy, can prevent a business from making changes with sufficient quickness. In addition, being well-established in a local community and adhering to prevailing industry logic can prevent an organization from quickly reacting to market trends by getting outsiders involved, by making strategic changes, or by shifting geographic or industry focus. Family firms also generally have an inherent desire for independence, which can curb their willingness to raise outside capital and therefore hurt their ability to invest sufficiently in innovation. There is also a tendency for risk appetite to wane as an organization grows, and its ownership becomes more dispersed across branches of a family.  Although responding to disruption can be challenging for family businesses, they can generally count on an enhanced degree of loyalty and trust among their workforces. In addition, their established industry connections can benefit innovation, while their relatively prudent investment strategies can lead to more efficient innovation, and their relative independence from external capital can accelerate related decision-making. Family businesses must foster innovative, entrepreneurial behaviour among all employees and family members. Their leaders need to focus on a culture of innovation, to capture the organization’s full collective creativity. One way to access ideas and specific skills is through open collaboration. The World Economic Forum’s 2015 report Collaborative Innovation: Transforming Business, Driving Growth notes that when firms share resources, significant value can be created for both parties as well as for the economies in which such collaborations take place. Another approach to innovation available to family businesses is to directly invest in startups, which families are increasingly interested in doing individually, through their family offices or through dedicated venture capital firms. This may present a particularly interesting opportunity to families hoping to diversify their portfolio, or to hedge against the risk of disruption.  This key issue is curated in partnership with Dr. Peter Vogel, Professor of Family Business and Entrepreneurship, IMD International.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.51"
"4.43","Agricultural Biotechnology","","Agricultural, or “green” biotechnology can be used to help improve crop yields and quality, nutrient usage, disease resistance, environmental stress resistance, and flowering time. Technology has been used to modify the genetic content of plants throughout the history of human civilization - long before the discovery of DNA, Neolithic-era farmers developed domesticated crops by selecting those with desirable traits derived from naturally-occurring mutation. Later, the selection of the most desirable plants from the general population was crystalized into the concept of breeding - which spawned a plethora of modern crops. The pinnacle of breeding technology has been the development of “semi-dwarf” wheat, which is sturdier and higher-yielding, and now accounts for most of the wheat acreage in the world after appearing around the middle of the 20th century. Advances in DNA technology, coupled with the identification of genes essential for desired traits, raised green biotechnology to a new level; scientists became able to not only pinpoint a gene regulating a specific trait, but also to introduce the gene into plant genomes by using methods such as particle bombardment. This ability to introduce a specific gene as a DNA fragment removed the biggest hurdle for conventional crop breeding: reproductive isolation separating different species. The successful generation of the blue rose using a blue gene from another plant species, for example, is testament to this. The removal of this species barrier has opened up new ways to mass produce valuable products, like edible vaccines and medicinal compounds. Meanwhile genome editing technology enabled by ZFN, TALEN, and more recently CRISPR/Cas9, promises even more precise plant engineering. This technology can knock out a specific gene, change the sequence of a specific gene, and replace one DNA fragment with another. This can occur without leaving a trace of foreign DNA or resulting in antibiotic-resistant genes (a flaw often associated with genetically-modified organisms, or GMO). The recent development of a soybean variety that can produce high levels of heart-healthy oils, and the engineering of wild ground cherries in a way that can make them as domesticated as strawberries, underline the ways green biotechnology may be able to help sustain a rapidly-expanding global population.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.22"
"4.44","Agricultural Inclusivity","","Agriculture plays a key role in poverty reduction, job creation, and food security; there are an estimated 2.5 billion people directly involved in agricultural production, and smallholder farms produce up to 80% of the food consumed in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Food access, however, remains unevenly distributed - as nearly 800 million people still suffer from hunger, according to the Global Panel on Agriculture and Food Systems. Agricultural productivity levels vary significantly across regions, with much of the developing world experiencing a so-called yield gap. Limited access to things like fertilizers or improved seeds, information (such as market prices for produce), and poor rural infrastructure have the effect of constraining yields in developing economies. Other hindrances include a lack of knowledge about pesticides, enhanced seeds, machinery, and crop management techniques. Increasing agricultural productivity is crucial for improving the livelihoods of the poor. A study published in 2011 showed that agriculture has a stronger poverty reduction effect than non-agriculture activities - it showed that a 1% increase in agricultural per capita GDP was five times more effective in reducing the poverty gap than the same increase in other sectors. Women play a crucial role in agriculture. According to a report published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the World Bank in 2016, women account for half of the agricultural labour force in sub-Saharan Africa (and more than 60% in countries such as Lesotho and Sierra Leone). Research has shown that a persistent gender gap in terms of agricultural yields, however, is the result of women’s inadequate access to productive resources and technical knowledge. Young people, meanwhile, tend to not see the agriculture as an attractive professional option. They also often lack sufficient access to the knowledge necessary to gain related entrepreneurial skills. This is unfortunate, as the global inter-connectedness and importance of agricultural systems means that related shocks can severely affect the most vulnerable populations. Research has shown that the urban poor spend as much as 80% of their income on food, for example, meaning that there are serious economic and social consequences for price swings. Efforts to build more stable and equitable markets have included providing farmers with access to index-based insurance structures; implementing multilateral agreements to limit distortionary trade policies; developing adequate emergency food stocks; and using mobile apps to better connect smallholder farmers with market information.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.60"
"4.45","Agriculture and Water Impact","","In the next 40 years, the world’s farmers will need to produce more food than they managed to produce in the previous 10,000. The challenge of feeding a growing, increasingly affluent global population comes alongside related, increasing demands for water and energy, at a time when climate change is poised to further alter the availability of water resources. Agriculture already places significant pressure on the world's freshwater, by accounting for nearly 70% of global water withdrawals (the number actually rises to nearly 90% in countries where farming is most intensive). Unless substantial efforts are made to reduce food waste, and increase the water-use productivity of agriculture - that is, to get more “crop per drop” - water demand generated by the agricultural sector is only projected to further increase; according to a United Nations report published in 2017, the global population is expected to increase to about 9.8 billion by the year 2050, from roughly 7.6 billion currently - and then to increase further to 11.2 billion by the year 2100.   Changes in diet will also play a crucial role in increasing demand. Greater demand for staple crops like maize and wheat, for example, is coinciding with a dietary shift that has people eating more livestock and poultry products, including meat, dairy, and eggs. Meat-based diets are more water-intensive than the vegetarian variety. UNESCO has predicted that global food demand will increase by 70% by 2050. Already, aquifers (layers of permeable rock that serve as reservoirs for ground water) in many regions with high-potential farmland are being depleted, and nutrients from farm runoff are polluting drinking water wells and resulting in harmful algal blooms in lakes and rivers. Technology that can help to increase crop yields and make plants more drought resistant will become even more vital in the near future. Agriculture's harm to ecosystems can be mitigated by decreasing post-harvest waste, and by employing more sustainable fertilizer and pesticide use. Developed nations will likely adopt these technologies and techniques first, though the biggest benefits in terms of increasing crop yields will be enjoyed in developing nations - particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.134"
"4.46","Agriculture in Bangladesh","","Since Bangladesh’s independence in 1971, the country has managed to ensure food security even as the size of its population has doubled - and as agriculture as a share of GDP fell to less than 15% by 2016 from more than 50% in the 1970s, according to World Bank data. Over that same period, according to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, the country’s annual rice production rose to 34.7 million tons from about 10 million tons, as cropping intensity (the number of times a crop is planted in an area) almost doubled. Meanwhile technological advancements have enabled production of more food using less raw materials. More than 70% of the country’s population lives in rural areas, and two-fifths of those employed there work in agriculture, according to the Bangladesh Quarterly Labour Force Survey for 2015-16. The development of the sector has therefore reduced rural poverty, while improving nutrition; the undernourished as a portion of Bangladesh’s population declined from more than 20% in 2000 to 15.2% by 2018, according to the Global Hunger Index. Government initiatives including market liberalization and a reworking of tariff regimes have played a role in this improvement. However, a growing scarcity of arable land due to urbanization is a concern. In addition, a drop in the groundwater table as a result of current agricultural practices has caused arsenic contamination, which will need to be addressed. Bangladesh is one of the most climate-vulnerable countries in the world; its agriculture sector must undergo major structural transformation in order to account for the effects of sea-level rise such as increasing salinity, more extreme temperatures, and more frequent natural disasters. Already, salinity intrusion in coastal areas has affected rice production and fisheries. Policies designed to stimulate the adoption of new technologies and increase agricultural market efficiency should also incentivize farmers with higher returns. Best practices must be promoted for zoning and land use planning, alongside support for research and the development of new varieties of crops that can tolerate flooding and salinity. Broad, regional cooperation on water sharing and river management is called for, and local agro-based industries will need to be encouraged to pursue environmentally-friendly practices in order to strengthen their links to global markets.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.17"
"4.47","Air Traffic Management","","Autonomous drones are expected to increasingly share air space with civilian and military flights, making the need for careful regulation of the skies paramount. There is also a corresponding need to share related best practices and technologies among countries, particularly those that have adjacent airspace, in order to best streamline and secure international flights. Communication between manned and unmanned flights remains extremely challenging, however, and there is a dearth of research in air traffic management that focuses on merging and managing disparate systems as a seamless entity. New methodologies and technologies will have to be introduced, in order to properly manage the rapidly changing landscape of drone flight profiles and capabilities. Advances in artificial intelligence, particularly in terms of machine learning and the use of big data, as well as the use of satellite connectivity to track planes, can change the ways air traffic control is currently performed by introducing more accurate prediction of flight paths and delays - and by augmenting human capabilities in terms of surveillance and monitoring. Current research in artificial intelligence for air traffic management indicates that automated agents can serve as an efficient assistant to human controllers, by releasing humans from principal surveillance and monitoring tasks so they can focus on a more holistic, strategic vision of traffic flows across airspace sectors. This can result in increased safety for flights throughout international airspace. Predictive analytics, coupled with large datasets, can also help anticipate unforeseen events, thereby optimizing efficiency and cost. Meanwhile artificial intelligence can help to optimize take-off and landing scheduling, flight paths, and hand-over procedures that span across borders.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.5"
"4.48","Airspace Management and Infrastructure","","Drones challenge the traditional concepts regulators rely upon to manage airspace. Unlike manned aviation, where the primary focus has been protecting the people inside of an aircraft, the expendable nature of drones allows for new approaches. In the near future, the tens of thousands of craft now in the air at any time will increase to many millions, and the majority will be unmanned. This calls for a completely new air traffic management paradigm, shifting from people in towers controlling aircraft movement to highly automated systems that more closely resemble the internet, or mobile phone networks. A new approach based on systems performance, and risks posed to the people and property on the ground (as opposed to airport-based airspace access), is now being pursued by bodies that regulate international and domestic air access. While traditional aviation utilizes well-established equipment and minimum design standards, supplemented by training and knowledge requirements for pilots and maintenance crews, the elements of the drone industry are still forming in an environment of rapid change. In any case, the traditional airspace control model using radar, standardized radio-based communication and human-focused situational awareness equipment will be obsolete in the new paradigm. A European Commission study published in 2016 estimated that at least €200 million in additional research & development investment must be made over the coming decade in order to integrate drones into controlled airspace in Europe. Investment levels in Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM) systems, the so-called Internet of Things that brings everyday devices online, and blockchain infrastructure may define the use of airspace during the Fourth Industrial Revolution. As systems developed for UTM transform traditional air traffic management, machine learning, or the ability of computers to self-learn, and artificial intelligence will be used to modify flight plans and airspace permissions in real-time, in response to weather, changing missions, and a need to accommodate emergency vehicles and deliveries. As new, highly-automated drone delivery systems are developed for urban environments, and autonomous aerial platforms emerge for transporting people within cities, additional physical infrastructure will have to be developed; docking stations in community centers, or on rooftops, where drones can release packages, and numerous launch pads for urban aerial mobility vehicles. The cost of this additional infrastructure, how it will be funded and who will own it remain open questions. Drones vividly illustrate the challenges of integrating disruptive technology into a system that has long operated within a well-established, consistent environment. While current air management models have evolved over the course of hundreds of years without much change, taking advantage of the Fourth Industrial Revolution will require a new paradigm for the air that can accommodate rapid technological shifts.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.42"
"4.49","America's Digital Economy and Competitiveness","","As we advance further into the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the US is growing increasingly interconnected through technology developments like the Internet of Things, which strings together myriad everyday devices via the web, and an internet-based gig economy that enables just about anyone to offer up their car or home for paid, temporary use. That in turn has fuelled a digital economy that is a key engine of growth and job creation. The US exported nearly $39 billion in telecommunications, computer and information services in 2017, compared with about $36 billion in the prior year, according to the US Commerce Department. The digital economy alone is projected to add $365 billion to annual US GDP by 2020, according to a 2015 analysis of the Accenture Digital Density Index by Accenture and Oxford Economics. However, the social, political and economic implications of this surge of technologies, which enables information sharing on an unprecedented scale, remain unclear - particularly in the context of the Donald Trump presidency. The treatment of the massive amounts of personal data generated by the digital economy presents one of the US's most complex challenges. According to the Pew Research Center, as of 2014 about 91% of Americans believed consumers had lost control of how their personal information is being collected and used by companies. US policy-makers are wrestling with how to best regulate the digital domain, including how to implement privacy standards and shield sensitive data across multiple platforms. Events including Facebook’s disclosure that personal data related to its users had been improperly obtained by political analytics firm Cambridge Analytica underline the need for the improvement of protective standards and rules. Despite the occasional setback, technology innovation, and the ways in which it is regulated, remains a key source of US competitiveness. The forces of globalization are both opening up new markets for this innovation, and potentially creating new competition for US firms as governments around the world invest heavily in the education and training of scientists and engineers.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.130"
"4.50","America's Role in the World","","While the US remains an economic and military heavyweight, its role on the international stage has shifted. The country is at a critical juncture, as it tilts toward isolationism, and displays a hesitancy to engage in traditional diplomacy and international trade relations under the presidency of Donald Trump. According to the Soft Power 30, a ranking of global influence compiled by the communications firm Portland and the USC Center on Public Diplomacy, the US slipped to fourth place by 2018, from first place as of 2016. President Trump has opted to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, chose to apply tariffs to products imported from China that triggered a trade dispute, and subsequently proposed tariffs on imports from traditional allies before refashioning the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement. The US has also withdrawn from the United Nations Human Rights Council, and in May 2018 the Trump administration pulled the US out of the international nuclear accord with Iran - opening new rifts with European allies and potentially further destabilizing the Middle East. The following month, Trump staged a meeting with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, and the two sides have engaged in discussions about denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. A 2016 Pew Research Center report showed that American support for US participation in the global economy, and for its closer trade ties with other countries, dropped to 49% from the 77% registered in 2013; a more recent Pew Research Center report showed that as of 2017, fewer global respondents saw the US as the world’s leading economy, and increased numbers instead cited China or the European Union. In Mexico, the US’s neighbour and key trading partner, only 47% rated the US as the leading economic power in 2017, compared with 60% in 2014-2016, according to the report. The election of Trump reflected an uncertainty among Americans about whether the US should engage in challenging global matters (though midterm elections in 2018, which brought the House of Representatives under the control of some of Trump’s critics, suggested the electorate may not be entirely convinced by his approach to the issue). Meanwhile the relationship between the US and Russia has become particularly complicated, amid questions about alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential race. In 2018, the US imposed related sanctions on Russian organizations and individuals.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.130"
"4.51","An Ageing Population","","The ageing Baby Boomer generation presents a fiscal challenge for the Australian government. Australia has the third-highest life expectancy rate among all Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, and its federal government is the primary funder of retiree services including pensions. Over the past thirty years, related costs have doubled, and are now equivalent to 4% of GDP. The number of Australians 85 or older is expected to top 1 million in the next 20 years, and a leveling off of net immigration and the continued decline in the birth rate will lead to a smaller, less productive workforce. The government’s budget policy-making is generally based on census statistics in a report commissioned every four years; the most recent report, from 2015, suggested that Australians urgently need to be more productive, have more children, retire later, and maintain optimal health. Critics of the report argue that it incorporated a politicized misunderstanding, as there is not necessarily a relationship between population growth and higher productivity. Other questionable assumptions in the report included the notion that there will be little net increase in the number of migrants in coming decades, who can provide a related economic stimulus. Critics of the report also note that potentially transformational factors were not taken into account, such as home ownership rates, workplace accessibility, women’s increased participation in the workforce, and lifestyle choices that might favour leisure and family needs over careers. Statistical reports published by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare also challenge the assumption that an ageing population will make a greater demand on the national budget than the overall health and wellbeing of Australians. Prolonged medical treatments for the general population, increased demand for new surgeries, and the proliferation of costly pharmaceuticals are increasing public health expenditures. Nearly two thirds of all adults in Australia are overweight or obese; associated ill health, in the form of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer, is increasing. The institute’s reports also provide a more optimistic portrait of the very elderly than what is assumed by the government; two thirds of the very elderly consider themselves to be in good or very good health, only 39% are overweight, and almost half exercise regularly and eat adequate daily servings of fruit and vegetables. The question now is whether these seniors can serve as role models for the rest of the population.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.14"
"4.52","An Expanding Internet of Things","","The Internet of Things facilitates a flow of information between smart devices, cars, and home appliances; an estimated 8.4 billion physical objects were actively connected via the technology in 2017, according to the research firm Gartner, or an increase of nearly a third compared with the prior year. The impact this has on peoples’ daily lives is considerable. One can now cut travel time by making better decisions and taking an optimal route with less traffic, for example, while remote health monitoring for elderly patients is now more feasible. The spread of connected devices, and increased social media use and general online activity, have paved the way for new marketing techniques and customization, and play vital roles in new wealth creation. However, an increasing number of connected devices may make it difficult for wireless service providers to guarantee quality; one way to reduce cost and latency for the Internet of Things might be to deploy decentralizing blockchain technology. The advancement of the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence has triggered a major shift in the interaction between machines and humans. Intelligent human-machine interfaces could be deployed among connected devices, as could virtual reality and augmented reality technologies, in order to enhance efficiency. The potential for blending these technologies is tremendous; examples of related application areas include real estate (where property could be “visited” by someone virtually), architecture (where someone could tour a building before its construction), and healthcare (enabling the remote monitoring of patients). However, there are challenges that need to be addressed before mass adoption is possible. The cost of devices needs to become cheaper, for example, and data privacy and protection must be addressed. Human-machine interface technology could also be hampered by the bulky size, price, and compatibility of virtual reality and artificial reality devices. Still, there are exciting possibilities. According to a report published by the trade group GSMA in 2017, about 30% of smartphone owners in Pakistan, Bangladesh, and India had never used the internet on their phones due to a lack of digital literacy; Internet of Things-based human-machine interfaces could help overcome such challenges, by enabling the use of simple human gestures to access digital services.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.39"
"4.53","Anti-Globalism","","The widespread resurgence of nationalist and populist politics has raised serious questions about the future viability of global governance. This troubling trend is at least in part a result of backlash against globalization - against both the economic and social dislocations it has created, and those for which it is unfairly blamed. Populist movements generally express scepticism of perceived elites, and profess to having faith in the wisdom of ordinary people. Yet, paradoxically, they also tend to have an authoritarian bent and a belief in a strong leader able to mobilize the masses. Timely examples of successful populist movements include US President Donald Trump’s election campaign, and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s consolidation of political authority in Turkey. Such movements typically appeal to those people who are particularly worried about threats to their social status due to the actual or feared loss of a job, or to those troubled by immigration and changing cultural mores; in other words, people who feel especially vulnerable to exactly the kinds of changes unleashed by globalization. In a number of countries, governments have failed to understand or address the true impact of globalization on many parts of the population. Even if countries have ultimately benefited from greater economic openness, the lack of sufficient attention being paid to those left behind has weakened the political consensus supporting that openness. Anti-globalization movements tend to oppose not only the aims of global governance, which they believe are rooted in a fictitious, cosmopolitan unity of human interests - but also to the institutions that underpin global governance, which they believe are either biased in favour of countries other than their own, or are in favour of a rootless elite. These movements are also at least in part a reaction to the real failure of global governance institutions to effectively function, as was the case during the 2008 financial crisis. It is not surprising the people adversely affected by the limitations of global governance would turn against it. Unfortunately, however, this may exacerbate the very problems that nationalist populist movements aim to solve. That is because nationalist politics generally push governments away from global cooperation and problem solving, which may hinder the sort of effective global coordination that is required to successfully address challenges - which in turn risks triggering a downward spiral of mismanagement.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.68"
"4.54","Approaching Boundaries","","Thanks to roughly a half a century of miniaturization, the transistors used in integrated circuits have pushed us along a path of exponential improvement in terms of computing power. For example, while the microprocessors made by Intel in the early 1970s managed to squeeze about 2,300 transistors onto a single chip, more recent models developed by the company can fit more than 5 billion onto a chip, spaced only about 22 nanometres apart. The computing power at our disposal today is therefore a product of a relentless search for design and manipulation techniques, which have now given us control of features as small as 10 nanometres (each nanometre is one millionth of a millimetre, and a human hair is about 75,000 nanometres in diameter). However, the laws of physics may soon impose a boundary we will not be able to circumvent through more miniaturization. Thinner spacing of features is not only a fabrication challenge, but may also compromise performance and reliability. While it has held true for decades, Moore’s Law, which long ago projected that the number of electronic components that can be stuffed onto a single integrated circuit would double every year - it is now threatening to sputter out. So, how will we be able to spur continued advancement in the future? The materials sector is already making great strides, in particular in terms of optimizing the physical and logical characteristics of quantum computing (which does not use the traditional means of encoding information in binary 0s and 1s deployed by computers based on transistors, and instead performs a more abstract, fluid function that can enable greater speed in many cases). Improvements in terms of energy efficiency (thanks to both reduced power demands, and minimized power losses) and greater mechanical robustness will apply forthcoming generations of circuits to multiple applications in ways that our ubiquitous and necessary connected devices, textiles, and sensors will all require. Essentially, materials are becoming stronger, lighter, and tougher - and the limits imposed by simple combinations of materials are being surpassed by a rational, bottom-up design processes for hybrid materials, and by the manipulation of hierarchical composites.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.4"
"4.55","Aquaculture","","In 2014, for the first time in history, the global population ate more farmed fish than wild fish; this was a development as transformative as our forebears’ long ago shift from hunting and gathering on land to becoming able to rely on agriculture. Aquaculture in the ocean is a booming industry. According to a report published in 2018 by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, global aquaculture production excluding plants increased by roughly 30% between 2011 and 2016, to 80 million tonnes. Production of finfish alone during 2016 was valued at $138.5 billion, according to the FAO report. While growth has been geographically diverse, the vast majority is currently centred in Asia. China alone represents more than 60% of global aquaculture production. The industry’s expansion could help meet a growing global demand for food from animal sources that may increase by 80% by 2050 - fuelled by global population growth, and by increasing amounts of wealth in developing countries. Aquaculture could play an important role in promoting global food security. But there are challenges involved in keeping the nutritious products produced in lower-income nations within domestic markets, where they can help fight malnutrition and undernutrition; that’s because farmed seafood like shrimp is now often exported from developing to developed nations. In addition, just like farming on land, farming in the ocean can be environmentally destructive. While proponents of aquaculture note that it can take pressure off of frequently-overfished wild stocks, the negative effects of aquaculture include pollution, the harvesting of at-risk wild fish to feed farmed fish, and the destruction of wild fish nursery grounds (like mangrove forests) in order to build fish farms. Innovation could better enable more responsible fish farming, particularly as an increasingly crowded and protein-hungry world looks to the oceans for nourishment. The challenge will be to make ocean aquaculture something that can successfully meet food shortfalls - without also inflicting damage on ecosystems.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.103"
"4.56","Architecture and Standards","","The Internet of Things, which is rapidly connecting everything from doorbells to dams to the web, requires scalable, future-proof, and cost-effective architectural choices in order to thrive. By building on already-established reference architectures, companies and governments can develop standards with robust interfaces, and ensure healthy environments capable of addressing performance and safety issues. There is no one-size-fits-all solution for IoT architecture - whether it is in relation to sensing, communication, analytics, or actuation (turning an electric signal into a physical action). However, two specific models have become most common; the first is the concept of digital mirroring (sometimes referred to as Digital Twins), where real-world physical objects are duplicated as purely digital objects. These digital objects are able to interact with the physical world, with other digital duplicates, and with computing services - often using the cloud as a platform. Cloud services can in turn accommodate massive increases in computing power, which can be used to analyse large amounts of data or to create “Cognitive Firewalls” that protect physical systems against digital misdeeds. A second approach to an architecture for the Internet of Things relies on “edge,” or “fog” computing, which splits processing duties between responsive local computers and the cloud (where more heavy-duty, latency-insensitive analytics can take place). Dividing up processing like this enables devices and services to provide more prompt responses or perform more data-intensive analysis, albeit at a cost of greater power consumption. The importance of architectures cannot be overstated; they define the points and interfaces where standards can take hold. Developing a comprehensive set of IoT standards can in turn address networking, communication, and data handling, and can also help to improve overall interoperability (the ability of devices and services from different vendors to work together, share data, and improve utility and value). While emerging architectures and standards are helping to reduce the fragmentation that plagued early IoT systems, care must be taken to select and develop the right options - because the technical decisions made today will lock the Internet of Things into long-term, make-or-break trajectories, and over-standardization could lead to “vendor lock-in” limiting options and use.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.86"
"4.57","Arctic Environmental Risk and Degradation","","In addition to climate change, the Arctic faces environmental threats like marine plastic pollution, mining contamination, poor water quality, threatened biodiversity, and an increasing risk of oil spills - much of it associated with increased shipping traffic and resource extraction. Fossil-fuel extraction not only raises risks related to increased emissions, but also increases the odds of spills that can contaminate local air, soil, and water. Heavier maritime traffic meanwhile increases pollution via fuel use and greater rates of waste generation. Ocean vessels can generate waste including sewage and machinery lubricant, according to a brief published by the Pew Charitable Trusts in 2018, which can disturb the marine ecosystems on which Arctic populations depend - and reduce the availability of traditional food. Research has demonstrated that ocean currents have been naturally transporting plastic pollution into the Arctic, much of it originating in distant locations; this particular issue is currently a priority of the Arctic Council, an intergovernmental forum that, led by Iceland’s chairmanship, is expected to yield the first pan-Arctic strategy to decrease marine litter. Adverse environmental changes like increased in plastic pollution can directly affect regional biodiversity including people, plants, and animals - making it critical to at least mitigate (or in some cases entirely avoid taking) environmental risks in order to safeguard the environment for future generations. For example, an oil spill in the Arctic can be relatively difficult to clean up due to a lack of local response capabilities; in addition, oil decomposes less quickly in colder water, meaning a spill could pose a threat to human and animal populations for longer periods of time. Increased tourism and trade can also affect Arctic biodiversity by introducing invasive species. More ship traffic, for example, raises the risk of introducing invasive species through ballast water (water carried in a ship’s tanks for balance) or other mechanisms, with potentially devasting consequences for native Arctic species. It is critical to prioritize sustainability when planning economic development, and to evaluate and ensure environmental stewardship when considering new projects in the region - by, for example, factoring negative environmental externalities into traditional financial return calculations.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.10"
"4.58","Arctic Governance","","The transformation of the Arctic has introduced new geopolitical and geo-economic challenges, and significantly expanded the number of stakeholders involved in decision-making. These complexities stem from the international nature of the Arctic’s challenges, like the impacts of climate change and expanding polar shipping routes. The Arctic Council is the official coordinating body for intergovernmental cooperation on a wide range of issues - its six working groups cover contaminants, monitoring and assessment, conservation of flora and fauna, emergency preparedness and response, marine protection, and sustainable development. Eight member states participate in the Council: Canada, Denmark (Greenland), Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the US. Six indigenous groups are represented as Permanent Participants, 13 non-Arctic states have been granted Observer status, and non-state actors also engage as Observers. As it has sought to address cross-border challenges, the current governance structure, with the Arctic Council at its forefront, has been criticized for lacking real power to implement lasting, effective, and legally-binding solutions. Ultimately, it is up to each participating state to implement and enforce the recommendations developed by the Council. While other legal frameworks establish some rights and limitations for Arctic nations, including measures developed via the International Maritime Organization or the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, they may not be adequate to address the unprecedented challenges now on the horizon. Increasing access to the Arctic’s natural resources, coupled with mounting geopolitical tensions among several key Arctic players, has raised questions about the future of governance in the region. The Arctic is becoming increasingly important to each country’s national security - Russia and China, in particular, have accelerated their military and economic focus on the region. Russia has sought to reassert its military presence in the Arctic since the end of the 2000s, and in 2018 it began working to restrict the passage of foreign warships in the Arctic Ocean, according to the Estonian think tank the International Centre for Defence and Security. While the Arctic Council is prohibited from engaging in military security, the growing strategic importance of the region for many of the world’s largest militaries has created uncertainty about how related developments will be managed.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.10"
"4.59","Arctic Infrastructure Gap","","One of the biggest challenges for the Arctic is a lack of infrastructure. Except for areas in Norway and western Russia, the Arctic remains vastly underserved by roads, ports, and other infrastructure needed to boost economic growth and development. Current infrastructure development is generally geared towards furthering natural resource exploration, and there is a need to better involve local Arctic communities in the development of related projects that take into consideration community development and environmental sustainability. Better telecommunications infrastructure (including broadband connectivity) could also catalyse economic development, and is vital for emergency-response capacity, education, cultural preservation, and community health. In 2019, the investment firm Guggenheim Partners estimated that the Arctic may require more than $1 trillion-worth of infrastructure to support a healthy, sustainable economy (Guggenheim was instrumental in developing the World Economic Forum’s Arctic Investment Protocol, global guidelines to ensure that investment delivers sustainability). Developing Arctic infrastructure involves a relatively high degree of economic and environmental risk, given the remote locations and changing environment. In many cases projects like roads and airports in particularly isolated areas are simply not commercially viable, despite being necessary to facilitate more ambitious investment opportunities in the future. Climate change is also triggering infrastructure challenges in the region, particularly in the form of permafrost (frozen ground) thaw and melting sea ice in coastal regions. In severe cases, villages were built on permafrost and relied on the coastal ice sheet to provide protection from erosion, and now find themselves stranded in flood zones and pondering relocation (Alaskan villages like Newtok, Kivalina, and Shismaref have chosen this option). Some 70% of infrastructure in the permafrost domain is in areas with a high potential for the thawing of near-surface permafrost by 2050, and a third of all Arctic infrastructure (and 45% of hydrocarbon extraction fields in the Russian Arctic) is in regions where thaw-related ground instability can cause serious damage, according to a study published in Nature in 2018. Even if the targets established by the Paris agreement on climate change are achieved, much of the Arctic’s infrastructure will be impacted - making it crucial to plan now for a difficult future. Funding is a critical first step for any project, and clear government strategy that involves cross-border collaboration and private sector partnerships may be essential.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.10"
"4.60","Arctic Natural Resources","","As Arctic ice melts, there is an increasing focus on exploiting its natural resources. According to the US Geological Survey, the Arctic region is home to an estimated 13% of the world’s undiscovered oil resources, and 30% of untapped gas resources. Russia, which holds the largest amount of territory in the region, has identified the Arctic as key for the country’s future; its Yamal Peninsula gas projects alone are expected to eventually produce up to 360 billion cubic meters of gas per year. Liquefied natural gas from Yamal’s first development phase is already being shipped to China, along increasingly-accessible polar shipping routes. The Arctic is also rich in renewable resources, especially in terms of hydropower and wind, and much of it has not yet been fully exploited. Projects incorporating renewable energy sources into isolated, diesel-driven energy systems in the region are ongoing, in order to increase local energy security, lower costs, and improve air quality. A growing number of Arctic communities have implemented renewable energy projects, in places like the Yakutia region of Russia. In some parts of the Arctic including in Iceland and Norway, industries are increasingly taking advantage of local green energy to do things like power data centres. In addition to natural energy, the Arctic is rich in metal and mineral resources, including diamonds, gold, copper, zinc and rare earth elements such as uranium. Most parts of the Arctic feature some mining, but there is tremendous potential for growth. In addition, the Arctic has vast marine resources; some Arctic states rank among the top marine producers in the world, including Russia, Canada, Iceland, and Norway. The ocean remains a key food source for people in the region, and responsible marine resource management is crucial. In general, the question of balancing Arctic economic development with environmental conservation promises to remain a topic of intense debate given the risks associated with development. Serious efforts must be made to ensure that future exploitation of the region’s natural resources unfolds sustainably, so that this unique and vulnerable environment is maintained for future generations.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.10"
"4.61","Arctic Transport and Shipping","","Melting Arctic sea ice is opening new shipping routes that are gradually transforming the region’s commercial relationship with the rest of the world. New routes include the Northwest Passage tracing North America’s coastline, the Transpolar Sea Route cutting across the Arctic Ocean, and the Northern Sea Route along the coast of Russia. These have shortened shipping distances from Asia to Europe by up to 40%, cutting both travel days of and fuel costs while potentially reducing related carbon dioxide emissions. However, the new routes’ commercial viability is highly dependent on weather and ice conditions, and on the existence of viable infrastructure to support commercial operations. Further loss of sea ice is expected, suggesting that the competitiveness of these routes will only continue to grow. Among them, the Northern Sea Route is the most commercially viable and has been home to a growing number of liquefied natural gas shipments from Russia’s Yamal Peninsula to Asia during the summer. The increased production of liquefied natural gas, crude oil, and coal contributed to the 15 million tons of cargo transported along the Northern Sea Route between January and November 2018, compared with roughly 9.7 million tons during 2017, according to media reports. The Arctic cruise ship tourism industry has also been expanding, as the region becomes a more popular destination. By 2022, dozens of new vessels capable of traversing the Arctic are expected to be added to the existing global cruise ship fleet. As commercial and tourism-related traffic increase, the enforcement of safety standards is key - though a lack of infrastructure continues to hinder rescue capabilities. A shipping boom in the region could conceivably lead to a Titanic-like disaster or an accident like the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska. And while climate change may be increasing shipping opportunities, it is also causing permafrost (frozen ground) to thaw in the region, damaging roads, harbours, and airports in the process. Thawing permafrost is expected to continue to increase, as related costs to Alaska’s transportation infrastructure have already topped $10 million annually. Increased tourism has meanwhile created demand for more flights to the Arctic and a need for improved airport infrastructure; for example, Nextjet began servicing a route connecting Arctic Norway, Sweden, and Finland with a larger, 50-seat jet in 2017. The multinational Arctic Maritime and Aviation Transportation Infrastructure Initiative has helped foster greater cooperation on transportation issues in the region.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.10"
"4.62","Argentina’s Global Repositioning","","Argentina is seeking to join the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), as it fosters stronger links with emerging economies and strengthens existing relations with developed countries in order to boost foreign investment and alleviate poverty. The country has helped to establish regional trade frameworks, such as the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, Mercosur, the Organization of American States, and the Union of South American Nations. However, economic survey results published by the OECD in March 2019 noted that Argentina is significantly less integrated into the global economy than other emerging market economies, due to relatively high tariff barriers that protect it from international competition and “often slow” integration into global value chains (the worldwide networks of production and services that are often behind a single product such as an iPhone). The OECD survey projected that Argentina’s economy, which is expected to begin emerging from a deep recession, would contract by 1.5% in 2019 before returning to 2.3% annual growth in 2020 - as long as the country continues with reforms such as reducing domestic regulatory barriers to market entry.  When Argentina chaired the first G20 summit held in Latin America in November 2018, it focused on four pillars: the future of work, infrastructure for development, a sustainable food future, and a gender mainstreaming strategy. The summit successfully concluded with a joint statement signed by all members - albeit with concessions made to the US on language regarding protectionism, and to China on language regarding unfair trading practices. The summit’s organization was seen as a reflection of Argentina’s commitment to improving its links with the international community - and as a result bolster its social and economic development. A key element of Argentina’s current foreign policy is the collective promotion of trade and investment agreements together with fellow Mercosur members (Argentina was a founding member of the trade bloc, along with Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay). Mercosur is negotiating a significant transcontinental trade agreement with the European Union, and is increasingly teaming with the Pacific Alliance (which includes Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru), to foster free trade agreements. One particular focus for Argentina when it comes to international trade has been negotiating greater market access for its agricultural products.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.11"
"4.63","Argentina’s Infrastructure Gap","","About $41 billion in investment will be necessary to meet Argentina’s infrastructure needs by the year 2040, nearly twice the $21 billion in investment that is currently anticipated for the country by that point, according to the Global Infrastructure Outlook, a tool developed by the Global Infrastructure Hub and Oxford Economics. For the energy sector alone, that gap is expected to reach $2.2 billion, according to the tool. The quality of Argentina’s overall infrastructure was ranked 68th out of 140 countries in the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index for 2018, an improvement from 81st place (out of 137 countries) in the prior year. Inadequate public (and private) investment during the 2000s led to infrastructure deficits, particularly related to energy, transport, and logistics. According to a study published by the Center for the Implementation of Public Policies Promoting Equity and Growth, private investment in Argentina’s infrastructure between the years 2003 and 2013 amounted to just 0.7% of GDP - down from with 5% of GDP during the 1990s. For the most part, this decline was a result of elevated investment risk and a lack of legal certainty. Total annual investment in infrastructure in Argentina between 2008 and 2013 was equal to less than 2% of annual GDP on average, according to a 2016 report published by the Inter-American Development Bank. According to estimates from the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, the country was expected to triple its related investment levels if it was to have any chance to close its infrastructure gap by 2020. Argentine President Mauricio Macri’s government has expressed an awareness that improved infrastructure is a key means to boost the economy, achieve sustainable growth, and ultimately to help reduce poverty. However, infrastructure planning in Argentina has historically suffered from (in addition to general investment risk) ambiguous prioritization, and poor coordination. To that end, the government has carried out institutional reforms aimed at improving the infrastructure project selection process and the management of public infrastructure projects, meant to simplify and improve the system’s accountability. The government now has specific infrastructure programs for each sector, including an electricity generation plan that aims to attract greater investment and significantly increase the amount of electricity derived from renewable sources.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.11"
"4.64","Argentine Exports","","More than 70% of Argentina’s exports are concentrated in natural resource-intensive goods like soy products. Meanwhile the country’s top five export markets account for nearly 40% of its total exports, according to the Inter-American Development Bank’s INTrade database. Argentina is one of the largest soybean and corn exporters in the world, and economic growth in China has only created additional demand from the world’s most populous country for Argentine commodity exports (Argentina won approval in April 2019 to export pork to China, which could help bolster its trade balance). However, in order to diversify its exports and its participation in global commerce, Argentina must try to expand smaller but promising sectors such as biotechnology. In general, even as Argentina’s manufacturing export performance has remained lacklustre, its exports of knowledge-based services have grown remarkably. The country’s share in the information and communications technology market has expanded, for example, and there is room for further growth - particularly in the software sector. Further expansion into areas like this could help reduce Argentina’s exposure to unpredictable commodity price cycles. Under President Mauricio Macri, who has been in office since 2015, Argentina initially removed virtually all taxes and quantitative restrictions on agricultural exports. However, export taxes were partially and temporarily reinstated in 2018 as part of a fiscal consolidation package aimed at curbing the deficit, and at reassuring both investors and the International Monetary Fund - which had recently agreed to a roughly $50 billion bailout for the country. The easing of restrictions had had a positive impact; in 2016, for the first time since 2011, the country’s exports of goods and services as a percentage of GDP increased on an annual basis - though that percentage was still low compared to what it had been during the 2000s. Argentina also managed to place 94th out of 136 countries in the World Economic Forum’s Global Enabling Trade Report 2016, an improvement of nine places compared with the prior report, due in part to better border administration efficiency. However, the country must still address structural challenges such as high transportation costs and limited access to technology for small-scale producers, in order to truly unlock its export potential.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.11"
"4.65","Artisanal Production","","In the 1970’s and 80’s, manufacturing began migrating to parts of the world that offered cheaper labour and adequate resources. From 1990 to 2012, for example, employment in the American textile and apparel sectors contracted by 76.5%, according to US Bureau of Labour Statistics data. However, changes in preferences have prompted a wave of specialized, small-batch, artisanal production that is bringing manufacturing back to urban centres in the West. For the first time in decades, American manufacturing has expanded, mostly due to small firms that employ 20 or fewer workers. Much of this “maker movement” stems from consumers’ desire for more unique, curated goods. It represents a return to local, individualized production and services where transparency regarding practices and points of origin function as key measures of value. People want things that transcend utility, and suggest personal values and cultural capital. “Fair trade,” “direct trade,” humanely-treated animals, and sweatshop-free clothing contribute intangible value to products in today’s consumer economy, making these qualities an important part of marketing strategies. Much like the Arts and Crafts movement influenced by the designer and activist William Morris in the 19th century, today’s artisanal manufacturers and their customers eschew the standardization inherent in globalized mass production. Instead, the goods that they embrace are a return to more taste-specific local production. Meanwhile the human and environmental costs of mass-produced goods have sparked an increased consciousness about consumerism. Where things are made and how they are made has both practical and stylistic implications, however; artisanal production does not necessarily fulfil a specific need, apart from aesthetic and social desires. The desire to buy from online vintage and handicraft emporium Etsy, or to eat organic, or to drink fair trade coffee may have social and cultural consequences, but it does not necessarily involve buying a new type of food or clothing with a practical utility different from previous versions. Part of discerning what artisanal goods are worth therefore relies on curation by key gatekeepers - editors, journalists, social media stars, and others - who can cultivate a taste for, and attach a status to, particular goods. These goods are not (by the standards of traditional luxury goods) necessarily expensive; their value derives from what they stand for, and where they come from.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.114"
"4.66","Arts in Education","","Providing a quality arts education can help students gain skills and attributes that are currently in high demand, such as problem solving, flexibility, persistence, and cooperation. The Arts Council of England published a review in 2014, The Value of Arts and Culture to People and Society, which noted that participation in the arts can reduce social exclusion and strengthen communities, as high school students who engage in the arts at school are twice as likely to volunteer in their communities as those who do not, and are 20% more likely to vote as young adults. According to a report commissioned by the Wallace Foundation, The Qualities of Quality, a quality arts education can strengthen one’s capacity to think creatively and to make connections - and one’s ability to apply creative thinking can in turn positively impact society. Many benefits of arts education are not easily quantifiable through data sets, however. Funding for arts education around the world has suffered drastic cuts in recent years, and it is often only included as a supplement to other subjects. The so-called STEM to STEAM movement, founded by the Rhode Island School of Design, aims to expand traditional STEM fields (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) to include “A”rt and Design, in order to enhance innovation. A digital mapping tool that illustrates “STEAM” activity around the world, in order to help advocates of the movement connect, was published in 2014. Adopting creative thinking in the commercial world can lead to positive results. A survey of CEOs published by the consultancy PwC in 2017 showed that 77% found it difficult to find the creativity and innovation skills they need; and, while STEM skills were seen as important, according to the survey, demand for them was outstripped by the desire for “soft” skills including creativity. The World Economic Forum’s 2016 Future of Jobs report counted creativity as one of the top three skills workers would require by 2020, and a subsequent Forum report, The Future of Jobs and Skills in the Middle East and North Africa: Preparing the Region for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, flagged a current deficiency of skills in the region including creativity and independent thinking. Creative risk-taking and experimentation can aid confidence; increasing students’ capacity for creative thinking is essential to prepare them to take on careers that do not yet exist, and to tackle problems not yet identified. This key issue was curated in partnership with Elizabeth Eder, Head of Education at the Freer Gallery of Art and the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, and Carol Wilson, Lunder Education Chair at the Smithsonian American Art Museum.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.13"
"4.67","Automotive Standardization","","Proprietary developments in the highly competitive automotive industry have resulted in several competing standards. When shopping for cars, people are faced with a web of varying specifications that have resulted in different plug types for the charging of different electric vehicles, different data formats for points of interest on maps for different cars, and varying data security standards. This mix of standards hinders car buyers’ interest in related features. The next generation of connected vehicles would therefore benefit from a common set of technical specifications. This will only become more imperative amid the evolution of technologies such as vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and hands-free calling. So-called vehicle-to-everything connectivity, or V2X, is an area of particular interest when it comes to implementing standards, as it underpins several important automotive industry trends including ride-hailing and autonomous driving. A particular area of concern relates to the use 5G wireless technology as opposed to WiFi. While telecommunications giant Vodafone favours 5G, for example, not all companies in the auto industry are on the same page when it comes choosing a standard.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.15"
"4.68","Autonomous Transportation","","Large drones, originally invented for military missions, are almost ready for general transportation use. These drones are expected to be integrated into civil airspace after 2020, when the International Civil Aviation Organization releases rules for worldwide operation. Meanwhile smaller drones are already gaining popularity, thanks to their low operating costs and low risk. Agencies such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in the US are developing a new drone traffic management system, and we may soon see crowds of drones in the sky that resemble scenes from a science fiction film. These machines are expected to create new job opportunities in some cases, and to take away jobs in others. Autonomous cars, unlike drones, are not yet ready for prime time. The latest self-driving cars, however, are equipped with sensors that can see in night time darkness and scan their surroundings more than 10 times per second, with extreme accuracy. Their brains are state-of-the-art computers that can make trillions of calculations per second, and communicate both with other cars and with the cloud in order to receive the latest traffic updates.  Self-driving cars compute an optimal path by sensing their environment and predicting the movement of obstacles. During this process, artificial intelligence views human life as a cost in its calculations. But it is very difficult to represent the value of human lives as a cost function in a mathematical equation. And no matter how sophisticated the on-board artificial intelligence, it is very difficult to assess how much collateral damage a potential collision will cause beyond impact. Only when autonomous cars’ accident rate is proven to be significantly lower than that of human drivers will they be broadly welcomed and deemed safe enough to carry human passengers. In 2016, Airbus announced plans for an autonomous air taxi - and later that year Uber announced its own plans for an autonomous air taxi. In the meantime, however, Uber has had to deal with safety issues; in 2018, an Uber autonomous car struck and killed a pedestrian in Arizona. If and when autonomous drones and cars are granted equal right of way in civil airspace and on roads, it will prompt an interesting question: should robotic workers be granted similar privileges at work that protect them from discrimination?","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.12"
"4.69","Avoiding Disparities","","Important health discoveries have been made using genomic technologies such as those used to sequence and analyse DNA. However, it is necessary to capture genomic information (related to all of the genetic code within a cell) from a wide range of people in order to avoid increasing health disparities. Early genomic research focused primarily on populations with European ancestry; in 2009, 96% of the people accounted for in genome-wide association studies (or GWAS) were of European descent. By 2016, diversity in GWAS studies had improved - 19% were of non-European ancestry, with most of the growth among those of Asian ancestry. GWAS studies have shown that different genes among different ethnic groups may be implicated in both genetic and communicable diseases. In the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program, which began in 2014, African American genomes make up 26% of the total analysed, while Hispanic/Latino genomes make up just 10% - non-European genomes clearly remain underrepresented. Unless genomic research becomes more inclusive, minority populations will not realize the promise of Precision Medicine, and health disparities will only continue to grow.  Genomic architecture can vary widely across populations, and rare variants - important for determining disease risk and drug response - tend to be population-specific. However, incorporating diverse populations in genomic research presents methodological and analytical challenges. The research community must therefore develop and incorporate new research designs and analytic tools necessary to overcome these challenges. The inclusion of diverse populations in the design of a research study must also be rewarded. Advances in genomics research should help to ameliorate, rather than contribute to health disparities among diverse populations. In addition, it is possible that the inclusion of diverse populations will bring the benefit of identifying important genes and pathways for a variety of diseases, and improve overall human health.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.109"
"4.70","Balance of Care and Careers","","In many societies, even as women have entered the labour force, they have also retained primary responsibility for unpaid work such as family care-giving and household chores. In this way, gender gaps in terms of paid work are partly a reflection of gender gaps in unpaid work. In advanced economies, men do just 34% of the unpaid work that women do, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization data show that this imbalance starts early, with girls spending 30% more of their time on unpaid work than boys. On average, women work 50 minutes more per day than men, in terms of both paid and unpaid work combined, according to the data. There is growing interest in better facilitating women’s integration into the workforce. According to a report published by the OECD in 2017, a number of countries have sought to increase fathers’ care-giving workload, such as the Czech Republic and Turkey, which in recent years have introduced statutory, paid paternity leave, while ten OECD member countries have begun offering financial incentives in order to encourage fathers to take parental leave for at least two months; South Korea offers as much as 100% wage replacement for three “daddy months,” according to the report.   Other care-related policies have included financial arrangements to facilitate care for elderly relatives, family benefits and other subsidies, career breaks, remote work programs, and flexible and reduced hours - in addition to services like home care for the elderly, and nursery care for small children. Such practices often represent long-term public and private investments, though they have the potential to generate strong social and economic returns. They can also produce sizeable spill-over effects. According to the International Trade Union Confederation’s 2016 report Investing in the Care Economy, if 2% of a country’s GDP were to be invested in its care industry, there would be corresponding increases in overall employment that range from 2.4% to 6.1%, depending on the location. This would equate to nearly 13 million new jobs in the US, 3.5 million new jobs in Japan, nearly 2 million in Germany, 1.5 million in the United Kingdom, and 1 million in Italy.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.63"
"4.71","Bangladesh’s Infrastructure Deficit","","Bangladesh has been investing in power generation capacity, port services, transportation infrastructure like road and rail networks, and expanded internet access. The percentage of the population with access to electricity increased to nearly 76% by 2016 from 50.5% in 2006, according to World Bank data, while the percentage of the population with a mobile broadband connection is expected to grow to 82% by 2025 from 29% in 2017 (according to the GSMA). Still, in order to boost economic competitiveness, Bangladesh must take steps to address a lingering infrastructure deficit. The poor state of infrastructure affects the movement of people and goods, productivity, and efficiency. According to the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index for 2018, Bangladesh ranked 109th out of 140 countries in terms of quality of infrastructure. Capacity at the country’s international airports and sea ports must be increased, and urban transportation networks and intercity links remain weak. Significant investment is needed to address urban congestion and insufficient traffic management. The World Bank estimated in 2013 that Bangladesh will need to invest as much as $100 billion between 2011 and 2020 in order to develop sufficient infrastructure (the country’s GDP was about $250 billion as of 2017). The government’s Seventh Five Year Plan (covering the fiscal years through 2020) prioritizes infrastructure development. Bangladesh’s rail network, long neglected, is now receiving the attention it deserves. In recent years, government allocations for rail infrastructure have been on the rise. Between fiscal years 2011 and 2016, Bangladesh invested $21.4 billion in key infrastructure elements including transportation, communication, fuel, and energy. As it invests, Bangladesh must pursue development strategies that are as environmentally sustainable as they are economically viable. Projects will have to be tightly managed to rein in costs, and governance and management will need to be generally improved (as will transparency and accountability among government bodies and development institutions). If Bangladesh is to maximize its potential as a regional transport hub and gateway to the Bay of Bengal, the country must coordinate the development of transportation networks that are closely aligned with its long-term vision. In addition, the country must proactively explore new sources of financing - such as the BRICS Development Bank, and public-private partnerships.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.17"
"4.72","Bangladesh’s Place in the World","","In the early 1990s, Bangladesh made policy shifts in favour of trade liberalization, deregulation, and privatization. These have led to stronger global integration, and significant economic gains. According to the country’s central bank and the Bangladesh Export Promotion Bureau, the share of the country’s economy dedicated to importing and exporting (a measure of openness) rose to 34.9% by fiscal 2015-16, from 16.8% as of 1990-91. Bangladesh has benefitted from preferential market access to developed countries, thanks to its United Nations designation as a Least Developed Country. According to data published by the International Trade Centre, the country has emerged as the second largest exporter of apparel after China. It is strategically situated between China and the other rising power of the 21st century, India, and serves as a gateway to the Bay of Bengal. The country is a member of the South Asian Free Trade Area, it has joined a number of initiatives including the Bangladesh, China, India and Myanmar (BCIM) Economic Corridor, and is a participant in China’s massive Belt and Road infrastructure-building initiative. There is much progress yet to be made. Bangladesh’s exports are still overwhelmingly concentrated in apparel (more than 80% of the country’s global exports in fiscal 2016-17). In addition, markets in North America and Europe account for 72% of Bangladesh’s exports, which calls for diversification. According to the International Trade Centre data, members of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation account for just 6% of Bangladesh’s global trade; this region could become a significant importer of the country’s goods, with improved transportation logistics and trade facilitation. Some projects could reduce the cost of doing business with neighbours, such as the Bangladesh-Bhutan-India-Nepal (BBIN) motor vehicles agreement, which aims to open up members’ roadways to one another. Other projects could be enabled by financing from India, China, or the recently-established Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and help Bangladesh exploit its location and better explore its maritime resources. In recent years, Bangladesh has taken a number of important steps to attract more foreign direct investment, for example by establishing the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority, and by setting up Special Economic Zones. Initiatives are also underway to enhance local workforce skills.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.17"
"4.73","Bangladesh’s Workforce","","Bangladesh is expected to benefit from its relatively young, potentially productive workforce. According to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, people aged between 15 and 29 represented about one-third of the country’s working population of 62.1 million as of 2016 - and the median age of the broader population was just 26. This presents Bangladesh with a crucial window of opportunity, and the country’s ability to achieve its goal of transforming into a developed economy by 2040 will depend on not wasting that opportunity. Every year, on average, about 2 million additional people enter Bangladesh’s labour force, according to the government’s Seventh Five Year Plan published in 2015. The creation of new jobs in sectors like agriculture, ready-made garments, construction, fisheries, and services has accommodated a significant number of these new entrants. In addition, in a welcome related development, more women have been joining the labour force; according to labour force surveys, the female participation rate rose to 35.6% in 2015-16 from 26.1% in 2002-03. Bangladeshis working abroad make a significant contribution; more than half a million have been leaving annually to become migrant workers, mostly to countries in the Middle East. The remittances they sent home in 2016 amounted to about $13.6 billion, equivalent to roughly 7% of annual gross national income, according to Bangladesh Bank. The portion of that migrant workforce considered to be skilled rose to 42.1% as of 2016, from 22.7% in 2001, according to the country’s Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training. In order to maximize its youthful workforce at home, Bangladesh must invest heavily in education, skills development, and technology. While education receives a significant share of the national budget (12.6% in fiscal 2017-18), attention should be paid to what those funds are providing. According to a 2016 International Institute for Labour Studies report, the country’s labour productivity is significantly lower than some of its competitors in the global apparel market (apparel accounts for more than 80% of Bangladesh’s exports). In addition, because 87.2% of the labour force toils in the unregulated, informal economy, creating well-paid, decent jobs is a daunting task.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.17"
"4.74","Bankable Project Pipelines","","The global infrastructure investment gap, or the difference between what is needed to build new infrastructure every year and what is actually being committed, is projected to reach $800 billion by 2040, according to the Global Infrastructure Outlook, a tool developed by the Global Infrastructure Hub and Oxford Economics. There is a general lack of bankable project pipelines (or programmed series of infrastructure projects), which are critical for drawing in essential private investment. While this issue is not necessarily new, it has become far more urgent due to increasingly strained public finances and continually mounting infrastructure demands. In the US alone, for example, the infrastructure investment gap is projected to grow from about $116 billion in 2020 to roughly $207 billion by 2040, according to the Global Infrastructure Outlook. Some of the obstacles to project bankability include a lack of skills and capacity, mismatched expectations for risk, and a lack of proper government planning. Public and private entities have been working together with governments to help improve the viability of project pipelines. These efforts range from creating national and regional project preparation facilities (which provide technical assistance for the structuring, financing, and execution of infrastructure projects), to initiatives like the World Economic Forum’s National Infrastructure Acceleration project - which takes a multi-stakeholder approach to helping governments deliver infrastructure. The G20 Eminent Persons Group on Global Financial Governance, established in 2017 to help promote economic stability, has proposed a raft of related measures, including asking governments to refocus efforts on building capacity and developing “human capital” (the attributes that can make people valuable to a company or a country), creating government-owned national investment platforms to mobilize development partners, and forming regional investment platforms that can facilitate multinational mega-projects. Potentially, increased attention to improving infrastructure project pipelines will boost the ability of governments to deliver infrastructure - and in turn boost social development and standards of living.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.79"
"4.75","Batteries and Energy Transformation","","The widespread deployment of batteries in power systems could enable some 600 million under-served people to gain access to energy by the year 2030, according to the Global Battery Alliance. Progress has been made in terms of enabling greater global access to electricity; according to the World Bank, as of 2019 the total number of people without access had declined to about 840 million, from 1 billion in 2016. However, the World Bank also reports that by 2030, some 650 million people may still be going without - and nine out of 10 of those people will be located in sub-Saharan Africa. In order to help address this issue, microgrids are being deployed throughout the region that are powered by batteries. In one example, the South African electric utility Eskom launched a pilot project designed to provide electricity to the 81 people in the rural Wilhelmina community in Ficksburg via a solar-powered microgrid. In a 2018 press release, Eskom said the microgrid deposits energy from the panels in three sets of lithium-ion batteries that offer 90 kilowatt hours of storage.                       The use of advanced battery technology could also help reduce air, water and land pollution. Replacing traditional, lead-acid batteries with more modern equivalents could help address serious related pollution issues, for example. According to a report published by the World Health Organization in 2017, the recycling of used lead-acid batteries is a public health concern because there is no known safe level of exposure to lead. As of 2016 data, nearly half a million deaths were a result of lead exposure, according to the report, with the heaviest related impacts on low- and middle-income countries, and on young children and women of childbearing age. Ultimately, the environmental benefits of greater battery use could include contributing to progress made towards achieving the goals set out by the Paris Agreement on climate change (in particular, the goal of limiting global warming to 2°C above pre-industrial temperatures) thanks to the decarbonization of both transportation via electric mobility, and of the power sector via the deployment of batteries to facilitate renewable energy. Emissions produced as part of the production of batteries must also be addressed. According to the Global Battery Alliance, greenhouse gas emissions intensity in the battery value chain could be nearly halved by 2030 by applying a more circular, sustainable approach.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.19"
"4.76","Batteries in Cars, Batteries in Grids","","By the year 2030, passenger cars will account for the biggest share of global battery demand, at about 60%, followed by commercial vehicles (23%), according to the Global Battery Alliance. Also by 2030, consumer electronics (think iPhones and tablets), will shrink from more than a fifth of the global battery market to only a “marginal” share, according to the alliance. As global battery demand grows by an expected 25% annually from now until 2030, they will power not only increasingly electrified transportation, but will also facilitate a shift from fossil fuel power generation to more sustainable models - via the deployment of batteries in power grids (and more decentralized, off-grid applications). Renewable energy sources tend to be intermittent (the sun is not always shining on solar panels, for example), creating an important role for batteries as a “balancing solution” capable of storing renewable energy until it is needed. In many ways, batteries are better suited to this role than, for example, pumped hydroelectric power - because of their flexibility (they can be installed in just about any environment) and relatively quick response times. Between 2015 and 2018, energy-storage battery demand grew by as much as 70% per year, and by the year 2030 roughly 220 gigawatt hours-worth of grid-connected batteries are expected to be installed, according to the Global Battery Alliance. Tesla installed a $96 million “big battery” in South Australia that is now used to provide storage and stability for the local power grid, and the company has indicated that the project has since led to even larger orders. Research is underway to bolster the safety of energy-storing technology - and mitigate incidents like the 2019 explosion and fire at a battery storage system installed by an Arizona utility to capture solar energy near Phoenix, which injured several people. Work is also being done to further develop so-called vehicle-to-grid, or V2G technology, which could coordinate power sharing between grids and plugged-in vehicles - and feed necessary energy into a grid during times of peak demand or emergencies. While this technology is still a work in progress, hopes are high that it could help answer questions about how to feed more intermittent - but necessary - sustainable energy into public power systems.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.19"
"4.77","Battery Demand and Production","","The cost of batteries essential for manufacturing electric vehicles has plummeted during the past decade, from about $1,400 per kilowatt hour to roughly $100 per kilowatt hour - enabled by a massive scaling-up of production. In 2019, a Volkswagen executive told the New York Times that the German automaker was paying less than $100 per kilowatt hour for batteries - a price generally accepted as the point where electric cars can start becoming more affordable than internal combustion models. Tesla was also reportedly on track to reach a cost of less than $100 per kilowatt hour as of 2018. Between 2010 and 2018, total battery demand grew by 30% annually, reaching a total volume of 180 gigawatt hours, according to a report published in 2019 by the Global Battery Alliance. The market is expected to continue growing by 25% annually until 2030, ultimately reaching a volume of 2,600 gigawatt hours, according to the report. The main drivers of demand growth: the electrification of transportation, and the deployment of batteries in electricity grids (by 2030, passenger cars will account for 60% of global battery demand, according to the report).  Car and battery manufacturers have been establishing a growing number of production facilities, such as Tesla’s Gigafactory near Reno, Nevada in the US, which the carmaker jointly owns and operates with its battery supplier Panasonic. According to a 2019 media report, Tesla, which has indicated that a lack of available batteries from outside vendors has constrained its production, is also working on a means to manufacture its own battery cells. Northvolt, a Swedish battery maker, raised $1 billion in funding in 2019 from investors including Volkswagen and BMW in order to help it complete Europe’s biggest lithium-ion battery plant, at roughly the same time that Chinese battery cell manufacturer CATL (Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd.) disclosed plans to invest €1.8 billion in a production facility in Germany (more recently, CATL disclosed an agreement to supply batteries for Daimler trucks). This increase in production could help curb carbon emissions as it creates jobs. Increasing electric vehicle production may result in the creation of 10 million jobs, and about $150 billion in economic value as it contributes to progress related to the Paris Agreement on climate change, according to the Global Battery Alliance.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.19"
"4.78","Battery Recycling and Second-Life","","In 2018, the total number of electric cars in the world exceeded 5.1 million, an increase of 2 million compared with the prior year, according to the International Energy Agency. This surge in popularity has brought with it corresponding growth in demand for lithium-ion batteries required to power these vehicles—promising a potential environmental reckoning once these batteries are spent. Different parts of the world have taken different approaches to tackling the issue; China, for example, has implemented measures that hold car manufacturers responsible for the “end-of-life treatment” of vehicle batteries, according to the IEA’s report, while the European Union has set standards for battery waste management since 2006 including a ban on landfilling - and has mandated companies to collect and recycle batteries. Lithium-ion batteries now predominantly used for automobiles (in addition to consumer electronics) can collect and discharge electricity for up to ten years after they are taken off the roads, according to a Bloomberg report published in 2018 - which noted that potential second-life applications for them include storing electricity from solar panels and wind turbines. These second-life applications can have practical, everyday uses. In Amsterdam, for example, an energy storage system at Johan Cruijuff Arena uses the equivalent of 148 new and used Nissan LEAF batteries to capture energy from 4,200 solar panels and store up to 3 megawatts of power - or enough to charge a half a million iPhones - for back-up purposes. To be sure, regardless of their post-vehicle uses, batteries should ideally be used as efficiently and for the longest duration possible. In order to help drivers be more strategic about optimizing energy consumption, big data and machine learning can be deployed; one study published in 2019 outlined an approach involving real-time prediction and a dashboard display to optimize braking. Machine learning can also be used more generally to better understand the current health of a battery in use, and to schedule replacements. Ideally, replaced batteries will become part of a circular economy approach; Audi and the technology firm Umicore, for example, have developed a related, “closed-loop” system meant to use valuable elements from the used batteries in Audi’s e-tron for new products.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.19"
"4.79","Battery Research and Development","","Cobalt, a raw material necessary for the lithium-ion batteries that make electric vehicles and cutting-edge mobile phones possible, can be problematic. For one thing, it may be in short supply relatively soon. For another, its extraction can be environmentally damaging and controversial - and the bulk of it takes place in one developing country, the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Whereas most lithium (another essential battery element) occurs as a “primary product” in the form of brines or ores, most cobalt must be produced as a by-product of copper and nickel mines, according to a report published by McKinsey & Company in 2018. Now, the growing adoption of electric vehicles means that demand for cobalt should increase by 60% by 2025, according to the report - and research & development efforts to find technologies capable of mitigating or even eliminating it as a necessity are crucial. Related efforts are underway, for example in terms of the development of the NMC 811 battery (“nickel, manganese and cobalt”), which uses three times less cobalt than existing models. Lingering issues with the practical use of the relatively energy-dense NMC 811 (including a limited number of charge-discharge life cycles) are expected to be ironed out in the coming years. Other types of advances are also being made. New materials for the cathodes that underpin batteries are being explored, for example; scientists at Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York reported in 2018 that they had synthesized a cathode material from iron fluoride that increases battery capacity. New concepts like lithium-air batteries, which can potentially enable relatively high energy density thanks to requiring fewer chemicals inside of a battery than traditional models, are also being explored. Funding is essential to make significant progress in battery technology, as are dedicated institutions and initiatives. The Faraday Institution in the United Kingdom, founded in 2017 to focus on electrical storage technologies for the automotive and other industries, announced in late 2019 it would grant up to £55 million to consortia trying to improve batteries for transportation and storage. Meanwhile the European Commission’s “Battery 2030+” initiative aims to mobilize researchers around the development of new battery technologies.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.19"
"4.80","Behaviour and Decision-Making","","Although we like to view ourselves as rational beings, in fact our behaviours are often far from optimal. This is clear when conspicuously bad choices are made, as in drug addiction and crime, but psychologists and economists have long been aware that our daily decisions about minor purchases or interactions with others are frequently biased and suboptimal. Our brains have deeply-rooted mechanisms that have served us well throughout evolution, but which can keep us from performing optimally in the modern world. There is increasing interest in whether the social sciences, including economics, can benefit from neuroscience sights into behaviour.   The ability to observe and record brain functions in combination with new tools such as virtual reality, machine learning and miniaturized recording devices is dramatically increasing our understanding of how the activity of billions of brain cells creates cognition and behaviour. This research is leading to a better understanding of the brain structures that underlie decision making, how they weight rewards and payoffs, and how those weights change when we learn. For example, a report from Yale University in a 2016 issue of Trends in Neurosciences suggested that specific regions in the frontal lobe are specifically involved in social decision-making. Progress in this area could guide better decision-making and promote better understanding of human nature, with implications ranging from public policy to law to interpersonal relations. Results from psychological studies of human behaviour have practical applications for undertakings as diverse as schooling, household economics, politics and policing. Neuroscience has the potential to provide a much richer view of how people learn, live and interact. For example, a deep understanding of the molecular, cellular and circuit mechanism of learning could improve the strategies we use for education. Integrated work that combines results from Neuroscience, Cognitive and Social Psychology and Behavioural Economics has the potential of revolutionizing approaches to optimizing human behaviour and decision-making to help people make rational choices.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.100"
"4.81","Benefits for Society","","Space applications have moved well beyond narrow, government-related purposes. India’s space-related investments, for example, have been directed at telecommunications systems that can provide education and other services to rural populations. European companies have meanwhile pursued space applications to profit from commercial ventures; Spot Image, a subsidiary of Germany-based Airbus Defence and Space, was among the first commercial firms to successfully disseminate images taken by Earth observation satellites. A wave of emerging space-based services, most still at the startup stage, tend include both a commercial and a social focus. For example, Planet Labs, an American company, provides imagery via hundreds of satellites that helps to monitor the environment, the management of resources, and potential human rights abuses (the company’s images were used in 2017 to help Amnesty International identify locations in Myanmar where members of the Rohingya minority group were targeted by systematic fires). OneWeb, a startup with offices in the US and the United Kingdom, aims to use satellites to deliver broadband services to underserved markets, while in remote villages in drought-stricken areas of northern Kenya, a satellite technology-based smartphone app called Afriscout is helping cattle farmers locate water and green pastures - which are becoming rarer due to climate change. These new space-based services may benefit those who are on the other side of the so-called digital divide, separating those with internet access from those who are deprived. That is because traditional telecommunications networks, based on terrestrial cables, are limited to those people fortunate enough to be living in relatively stable, wealthy societies. Satellite services, on the other hand, can provide access in conflict zones and in so-called least developed countries, which face extraordinary development challenges. Such services, often dubbed Space 2.0, are opening up new horizons for those in desperate need of information and access. They may also benefit developing countries economically thanks to increased foreign investment directed at local, space-related operations. For example, in 2017, the Australian communications satellite firm SpeedCast established an office in Papua New Guinea (classified by the United Nations as a lower-middle-income country), where it can contribute to the local economy and provide jobs. Meanwhile space agencies are working together to monitor greenhouse gas emissions; pursuant to the 2016 New Delhi Declaration, agencies from more than 60 countries are pursuing this effort. This may be bolstered by the growing number of organizations either operating or planning to operate satellites for this purpose.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.120"
"4.82","Big Data Analysis","","The growing availability of detailed data about weather, geography, vehicle performance, and customer behaviour, thanks to the broad use of internet-connected devices, social media platforms, and sensors, presents a significant opportunity for insurers to improve the accuracy of their underwriting. It can also help them explore new business models - such as so-called usage-based insurance, which ties the cost of coverage to discrete periods when it applies. In order to best take advantage of this deluge of data, however, insurers must develop the means to sift through large amounts of unstructured information in order to glean useful insights. One means of acquiring such potentially useful data is via smart home networking and the Internet of Things (which strings together devices and appliances with internet connectivity). Nest Labs, a Google-owned maker of internet-connected home devices, has partnered with insurance companies to provide data generated by its smart smoke detectors, for example, including battery status and a device's location. In return, partnering insurance companies have lowered premiums for Nest device users by as much as 5%. As insurers gather more behavioural data, traditional risk-pooling may give way to individualized insurance products, more targeted incentives, and the more efficient acquisition of customers. Life insurers, for example, have been able to eliminate the need for some prospective customers to take blood tests, by instead using other health data and answers supplied on applications, according to analysis published by the consultancy Bain & Company in 2016. Meanwhile Allstate has provided an app to customers that can track things like speed and braking, in order to potentially reward less-risky driving behaviour with reduced auto insurance pricing. While greater use of behavioural data can help insurers and their customers, it has also raised questions about privacy and security. The General Data Protection Regulation, being implemented in Europe, is expected to affect how insurance companies are able to handle personal data. Under the regulation, customers will be able to ask insurers to delete personal data not being used for its original purpose, according to the consultancy PwC. Ultimately, increased data gathering and analytics may even call into question the very need for insurance - as in-depth screening can result in extremely accurate risk profiling.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.82"
"4.83","Big Data and Mining","","Collecting and processing massive amounts of data will be essential for mining companies as they digitalize and automate operations. Increasingly, governments in countries where mining companies are publicly traded are approving regulations that require these firms to publish project-by-project data on payments they make to governments in the countries where they operate - in order to reduce corruption, properly disclose taxable subsidiaries, and increase transparency regarding the handling of particularly problematic minerals. Host-country governments have meanwhile adopted data-driven frameworks to bolster their evidence-based policy-making. Mineral buyers including the technology and transportation sectors and jewellers are also making use of big data, to gain insight into the provenance of minerals and to try to ensure compliance with their environmental, social, and governance standards. Investors are using the proliferation of non-financial data (like potential water scarcity in mine locations) in order to better assess the risks tied to their mining-related portfolios. Mining companies have been pressed to go beyond the global standard established by the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (which is funded by governments and corporations) when it comes to transparency on contracts and environmental impact assessments; local communities affected by mining are particularly interested in accessing data on issues including water quality readings, for example, though current corporate reporting only focuses on water intake. While the data revolution provides mining companies with an opportunity to better address reputational risk and attract investors, it will be essential for them to work together with other stakeholders in order to understand exactly which data should be made available, and the appropriate format for data disclosure - in order to ensure standardization and impact (blockchain technology and geographic information systems can be particularly useful in this regard). If data transparency requirements are not standardized, the amount of time and resources required for mining companies to provide the important information they are required to disclose may increase, to no one’s benefit. Other risk associated with the increased collection and reliance on data include cyber security breaches, and the misuse of vital information.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.99"
"4.84","Big Spending, Bigger Deficit","","Italy has made overall progress in recent years in reducing its budget deficit, even as it has been hindered by persistently weak economic growth and low inflation (often, measures aimed at fiscal prudence and cutting deficits have had the unfortunate effect of constraining growth). According to Eurostat, Italy’s budget deficit climbed to 5.3% of GDP in 2009, in the wake of the global financial crisis - subsequently, it was brought below the 3% threshold specified by the European Union Stability and Growth Pact. More recently, though, a big-spending economic program put forward by the previous government appointed in 2018 included measures aimed at expanding assistance programs for the poor, and dismantling the pension system while lowering the age when retirement benefits can be received. The erstwhile government also pushed for a universal basic income scheme. These measures were likely to add tens of billions of euros to the government’s budget, and potentially keep its deficit at a level deemed unsatisfactory by investors and the European Commission. Carlo Cottarelli, a former senior International Monetary Fund official and one-time prime minister in charge of a caretaker government, publicly estimated that the measures would have cost €126 billion. The government did not fully explain how it would fund its plans, with the exception of a reference to cutting tax deductions and a plan for a tax amnesty for individuals less than €100,000 in arrears. As a result, the planned spending could have caused deficits to balloon. The mere prospect of this caused Italy’s sovereign bond yields (a measure of perceived risk for its creditors) to spike, and the government collapsed in August 2019. The previous Economy Minister had sought to make public assurances that public accounts would not be blown up in order to keep campaign promises, though they were met with scepticism. The government also sought to explain that it might finance its proposed measures by discontinuing or rationalizing some benefits currently in place. Potential candidates for this had included the “baby bonus” used to incentivize prospective parents and address the country’s declining birth rate, and financial incentives for making environmentally-friendly home renovations.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.87"
"4.85","Bio Big Data and Machine Learning","","The biomedical sciences are transforming into big-data science. Thanks to next-generation genomic sequencing technology, there has been a dramatic data explosion; by 2016, more than 100,000 human genomes had been sequenced from normal and diseased tissue, and petabytes of raw sequence data are now being produced and deposited in public genome data repositories such as International Cancer Genome Consortium data portal. This is transforming the scientific landscape, and entire healthcare systems. Currently-archived datasets represent only a small fraction of the genome-related big data yet to be produced in the future, as sequencing capacity will continue to grow. If the current growth rate continues, doubling capacity about every seven months, exabytes-worth of genome data (one exabyte is equivalent to about 250 million DVDs worth of video) will be yielded in the next 5 years. As the global population pushes toward 8 billion within the next decade, it is possible that 15% or more of it will have their genome sequenced. In addition to genomics, high-resolution imaging, medical records, and lifestyle-related datasets will add new dimensions to bio big-data, and provide a foundation for next-generation healthcare. However, there is a long road ahead before big data can help deliver precision medicine based on a patient’s genetic makeup and environmental circumstances to the masses. There are immense challenges when it comes to data storage, distribution, and proper interpretation in biomedical contexts. Large-scale machine learning systems need to be integrated with vast computing infrastructure in order for deep learning, one of the most promising branches of artificial intelligence, to help better enable the navigation of big data and detect things that are impossible to catch manually. Machine learning could facilitate the mining of gene-to-gene interaction, the classification of cellular images, and finding links between datasets. Yet, machine-learning algorithms require large-scale, high-quality “ground truth” data for algorithm training - which is difficult to acquire. In addition, machine learning can be biased, and understanding exactly how machine learning algorithms are classifying the features in datasets can be challenging. Still, the analysis of big data will eventually have an enormous impact on disease prevention, on the ability to cure and care, and on the global healthcare system.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.22"
"4.86","Biodegradability","","Mechanical recycling is the only method now commonly used for the large-scale treatment of solid plastic waste. Because every type of plastic differs in terms of chemical composition, mechanical behaviours, and thermal properties, however, conventional mechanical recycling requires pre-sorting to separate non-plastic items and different varieties - which can be costly and time-intensive. In addition, the two types of plastic that can currently be mechanically recycled, polyethylene terephthalate, or “PET,” and some grades of polyethylene, together make up less than half (46%) of all annual plastic production. In order to make recycled plastic products, old PET or polyethylene is blended with virgin plastics in an expensive, energy-intensive process that ultimately results in lower-quality finished material. Further innovation is therefore essential, ideally with a focus on both mixed mechanical recycling and chemical recycling. The latter uses thermolysis (applying heat) or catalysts to break down plastics into their component parts, which can then be re-built into new plastics. Complete depolymerisation involves breaking a plastic down to monomers (molecules), which can enable multiple recycling loops with lower energy requirements - all while maintaining the material properties of the finished product. In general, chemical recycling is under-explored - though it is also the most feasible approach for dealing with PET (it is also expected to become possible for biodegradable and compostable polyesters). Innovative recycling technologies that enable the direct processing of mixed plastic waste without pre-sorting may offer other potential solutions. This would require a means to stabilize the behaviour of mixed plastic waste during the recycling process - and would have to be facilitated by better design of the ways that plastic products reach their “end-of-life.” Plastics additives and impurities can interfere with recycling, and policies that make plastic producers responsible for the impact of the entire product lifecycle may help commit more manufacturers to better design, while improving the economics of current end-use options. Some positive related signs include Unilever’s pledge that by 2025 all of its plastic packaging will be fully reusable, recyclable, or compostable. Moves like this are more necessary than ever before, as new plastics can create problems for mixed waste recycling; for example, PET and the bio-polymer PLA (polylactic acid) can each compromise the recycling of the other if they are mixed.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.107"
"4.87","Biodiversity","","Forests cover nearly one-third of Earth’s land area, and house more than 80% of terrestrial biodiversity. Tropical forests are home to the highest number of species per unit of land area, with particularly high rates of biodiversity in the Amazon basin of South America, the Congo basin of Central Africa, and the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. In addition, forests with unique compositions, such as those on isolated islands, or with varied topography, host high numbers of endemic species that are found nowhere else in the world. Any change to these habitats can lead to the extinction of the species that depend on them. Regions rich in both biodiversity and endemic species include Madagascar, the Hindu Kush-Himalayan region stretching from Afghanistan to Myanmar, and the highlands of Borneo. According to Enough is Enough, a report published by Eyes on the Forest in 2018, forest blocks in Indonesian Borneo and Sumatra, which were some of the last remaining habitats of critically endangered species like tigers, elephants, and orangutan, continue to be converted to palm oil plantations. Detailed information about the location of areas with rich biodiversity, as well as highly threatened areas, can be used to better prioritize conservation and protection efforts. Biodiversity may be best conserved by minimizing human intrusion into intact and relatively un-fragmented habitats, and by restoring biodiverse areas that have been highly altered. If areas like this can be identified, continuous monitoring of them could measure progress towards greater biodiversity conservation. Many efforts are already underway to protect biodiversity and mitigate the destruction of forested habitats. International mechanisms designed to help conserve species include the Convention on Biological Diversity’s Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020, the Aichi Biodiversity Targets designed to be met by 2020, and the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals adopted in 2015. Others, such as The Consumer Goods Forum, Tropical Forest Alliance 2020, and the New York Declaration on Forests, are focused on achieving zero net deforestation by 2020, and focus on the production of commodities (such as beef and palm oil) that is driving deforestation within tropical forest regions rich in biodiversity.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.54"
"4.88","Bioprinting","","While 3D printing (or “additive manufacturing”) promises to revolutionize the manufacturing industry, it could also have a similar impact on public health. For example, 34,770 organ transplants were performed in the US in 2017, setting a fifth consecutive record yearly high, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services. However, there were also more than 114,000 people on the US waiting list for a transplant as of early 2018, and 20 people die in the country every day as they wait, according to the DHS, which notes that only about three out of every 1,000 people die in a way that allows for organ donation. Some countries and regions have considered and passed opt-out laws; in England, for example, a system where people will be presumed to have consented to donation is expected to come into force by 2020. Still, a shortage of donors is just one obstacle. Others include a need to develop more reliable organ preservation techniques, and a constant need for biological compatibility between donors and potential recipients. Bioprinting could be the solution to these problems. The process of bioprinting organs uses 3D printing’s layer-by-layer method, and consists of a medically designed 3D bio-printer and bio-ink - a substance usually made from stem cells. Depositing layers of bio-ink on top of one another leads to creation of tissue that can eventually form an organ. This organ, because it can be created using a patient’s own cells, is much less likely to be rejected. That means that a patient would not need potentially dangerous immunosuppressant therapy, which can create susceptibility to diseases. Bioprinting could also be applied to drug discovery and toxicology. It could provide more reliable results than animal testing, for example, and would be safer than clinical studies. However, bioprinting is a time-consuming process and cells have to be kept alive throughout (tissues demand a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients). In this regard, vascularization, or the process of supplying blood through capillaries to living tissue, could help. In 2018, US-based company Prellis Biologics announced it had developed “pre-vascularized” tissue scaffolds that can be used to grow cells in 3D formats.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.0"
"4.89","Blockchain-based Legal Platforms","","Blockchain technology is likely to emerge as a critical legal platform, offering a distributed and reliable mechanism for verifying information such as the ownership of an asset or the accuracy of a claim. Many blockchain legal platforms will require a sound supervisory layer supplied by government, even as they are likely to play a role in the shift from exclusive reliance on government-based systems for law and regulation. So-called smart contracting is already in use, as a mechanism for automatically executed financial trades. A smart contract can be self-executing and coded directly into the blockchain, which functions as a digital register. Smart contracts still require human judgment, but they can substantially reduce the cost, insecurity, and failures associated with existing systems. One of the most transformational roles for blockchain as a legal platform relates to the enforcement of judgments. Parties with assets or rights assigned in the blockchain could satisfy judgments with these assets or rights by agreeing to a smart contract, conditioned on the entry of an order from a designated adjudicator. Companies doing business globally could benefit from blockchain enforcement by reducing their reliance on international agreements, or on courts that may have local biases. Blockchain-based platforms could help overcome weaknesses in the verification of the ownership of property used as collateral for credit - which could potentially be performed outside of government systems, with private providers verifying claims. Alternatively, governments could deliver their own systems for recognizing property claims through a blockchain platform, and reduce the potential for corruption. A similar benefit could be realized by moving other administrative procedures, like permitting for businesses or construction, or providing access to public utilities, onto a blockchain. Large numbers of people around the world, including migrants and refugees, currently lack a means to verify their identity, keeping them outside of formal legal systems. The lack of identity can result from a missing proof of birth, or citizenship, or educational credentials. Private blockchain systems are in development that could help these people establish a secure record of facts, which a private organization could verify. Other blockchain-based systems in development include tools for tracking the origin of goods, granting permission for access to health data, resolving disputes, and ensuring a means by which data can be stored, shared, and analysed with minimal loss of privacy.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.90"
"4.90","Bolstering Human Dignity","","The world is getting richer, but wealth is being concentrated in fewer hands. According to the 2019 Oxfam Inequality Report, the 26 richest people on the planet had the same collective net worth as the poorest 3.8 billion people - a group equal to half of the global population. In addition, 2,200 of the world’s billionaires saw their wealth increase by 12% in 2018 compared with the prior year, even as the poorest half of the global population saw their wealth decrease by 11%, according to the report. In 2017, meanwhile, global real wage growth fell to 0.4% - its lowest growth rate since the 2008 global financial crisis - according to the International Labour Organization’s Global Wage Report. The issue of inequality relative to economic development is receiving renewed public attention, as it has only worsened in many parts of the world since the financial crisis. That in turn has helped trigger the rise of populist political movements that exploit fears about job security and immigration. The successful campaign to encourage people in the United Kingdom to vote to leave the European Union is one example, and Donald Trump’s presidential campaign is another. According to the United Kingdom’s Race Disparity Audit, most recently revised by the government in late 2018, one in five children in black households in that country live in persistent poverty, compared with one in 10 children in white households. Meanwhile in the US black workers make 82.5 cents for every dollar earned by a white worker, according to a report published by the Economic Policy Institute in 2018. The risks created by persistent inequality threaten to trigger long-term problems, according to the World Economic Forum’s 2019 Global Risks Report; it noted that while global inequality has generally declined, inequality within countries has continued to rise. Coupled with political polarization, this threatens to erode these countries’ social fabric. In addition, the Forum’s Risk Report has in the past noted that the global gender parity gap in terms of health, education, politics, and the workplace only continues to widen. These developments have a very real human cost, not least in the form of psychological and emotional strain. Young people are increasingly suffering from mental health problems; in the US, for example, the proportion of people aged between 12 and 17 with depression rose to 12.7% in 2015, from 5.7% in 2005, according to the 2018 Risks Report.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.131"
"4.91","Brazil's Business Climate","","Improving Brazil’s business environment is necessary to boost the country’s long-term productivity. Brazil ranked 109th out of 190 countries in terms of ease of doing business in the World Bank report Doing Business 2019, 16 notches higher than where it had placed in the previous year’s edition. In particular, Brazil has showed improvement in terms of expanding access to electricity and to credit, and in terms of facilitating trading across borders. Meanwhile the country’s score for the ease of starting a business locally moved closer to the global average, thanks to the development of an online system for company registration. Brazil’s tax system, however, is a serious impediment for the country’s business environment; it is both complex, and hard to comply with. According to the World Bank, the average Brazilian firm spends 1,958 hours per year (equivalent to nearly 82 days) preparing and paying taxes - the highest of any country in the world, and more than eight times the global average. The costs of unnecessary bureaucracy strongly discourage companies from entering Brazil, which stifles productivity growth and encourages the unregulated, informal economy. According to the World Bank’s Doing Business 2019 report, Brazil ranked 140th out of 190 countries in terms of starting a business - with 20.5 days required for the process. Brazil also suffers from relatively burdensome regulation compared with both Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development members and with other large emerging economies. According to the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index published in 2018, Brazil ranked last out of 140 countries in terms of the burden of government regulation. Brazil also ranked near the bottom (117th) of the index in terms of product market - due to a lack of market competition, distortive subsidies, and relatively poor integration with global markets. Policy-makers have acknowledged a need for reforms that address taxes, labour markets, and the overall regulatory environment, and the administration of President Jair Bolsonaro, who was elected in late 2018, has declared an interest in addressing related shortcomings in hopes of unleashing the private sector’s potential.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.26"
"4.92","Brazil's Foreign Trade","","Economic openness can boost a country’s long-term development and growth, help to spread the use of new technologies and enable state-of-the-art production. Brazil’s legacy of trade protectionism, meanwhile, has limited its competitiveness. Despite a period of trade liberalization in the 1990s, policy constraints in the country remain significant. By 2017, Brazil had the world’s eighth-largest economy; yet, it ranked 26th in terms of global merchandise trade that year, and 35th in terms of commercial services exports. The World Economic Forum’s 2018 Global Competitiveness Index ranked Brazil 125th out of 140 countries in terms of trade tariffs, and 136th in terms of non-tariff barriers. The country’s relatively limited presence in global markets is long-standing; according to a report published by the Inter-American Development Bank in 2014, Brazil commanded just 1.4% of total world trade (less than half of its overall 3% participation in global GDP). Meanwhile in terms of global value chains, measured as the percentage of foreign-value-added that is embedded in a country’s exports, Brazil’s figure stood at roughly 10% - while the average for Asia was about 30%. Brazil is one of the few countries in the world that has not significantly reduced trade tariffs over the past 20 years. Its tariffs on capital goods are particularly punitive. President Jair Bolsonaro’s administration has expressed an intention to address this situation, and has argued that greater openness will be key for boosting productivity. Historically, Brazil’s occasional periods of increased trade openness did contribute to productivity gains and increased investment. Detailed analysis has shown that Brazilian manufacturing productivity accelerated in the second half of the 1990s, for example, following a process of trade liberalization that exposed firms to foreign competition and improved access to foreign materials and labour, while also lowering the cost of capital goods. Officials in Brazil have in the past laid out a vision in which trade and economic integration plays a significant role in supporting economic growth. The country’s foreign policy has been focused on establishing more proximity with the US and developed countries, while the Mercosur bloc (which includes Brazil) has been negotiating its own trade and investment agreements - including a potentially significant agreement with the European Union. In addition, Mercosur may pursue closer collaboration with the Pacific Alliance, which includes Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.26"
"4.93","Brazil's Infrastructure Gap","","The World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index published in 2018 ranked Brazil 81st out of 140 countries in terms of the quality of its overall infrastructure, down from 73rd the in the prior year's index. In terms of the quality of roads, the country ranked 112th in the most recent index, while for efficiency of seaport services it ranked 105th, and for efficiency of train services it ranked 97th (a bright spot was airport connectivity, for which it ranked 17th). Inadequate infrastructure investment can hinder growth, raise the cost of doing business domestically, constrain technology adoption, and limit engagement in international trade. According to a report published by the consulting firm Oliver Wyman in 2018, Brazil’s inadequate infrastructure is reflected in indicators such as the percentage of households with access to sewage (just 55%), internet services (less than half, at 43%), and water (83.5%). The report noted that by investing the equivalent of only about 2% of GDP in infrastructure per year, the country is failing to maintain existing infrastructure, much less build new projects (China invests roughly 7% of GDP in infrastructure, by way of comparison, while India invests about 5.5%).   Ineffective long-term planning, and a lack of an integrated strategic vision, have hindered the efficiency of infrastructure investment in the country. Project selection, screening, and planning are all inadequate, while clear criteria are not being applied to project selection and there is a disconnect between long-term plans and annual budgets. Regulatory uncertainty has also hindered investment, and financing options are limited. Burdensome procurement and environmental-licensing processes have slowed down projects, while proving ineffective at reducing corruption (which has dogged the country more broadly; two former presidents have now been jailed in relation to the Car Wash scandal stemming from a bribery and money laundering probe launched in 2014), or safeguarding the environment. The government has tried to strengthen the interaction between the state and the private sector as a means to improve local infrastructure. Since 2016, following the creation of the Investment Partnership Program (PPI), more than 100 infrastructure projects have been completed worth more than 250 billion Brazilian reals - and the program has a pipeline of dozens of projects lined up that could be worth an additional 130 billion reals. In the first quarter of 2019 alone the PPI expected to conclude projects including the concession of 12 airports, part of the North-South railway, and ten port terminals.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.26"
"4.94","Brazil's Macroeconomic Challenges","","Brazil has made significant progress on reducing poverty and inequality since the beginning of the 2000s. However, the recession that lasted from 2014 to 2016 revealed that many of these social gains cannot be sustained without corresponding productivity growth, and some level of economic dynamism. Also essential: efficient public spending that genuinely improves the quality of public services, and benefits the most vulnerable. In 2017, Brazilian respondents to the Latinobarometer survey ranked “improving social policies and social inclusion” and “ensuring equal opportunities for all” as the two most important development issues for the country. According to data from the country’s National Household Sample Survey compiled by the Institute for Applied Economic Research, the portion of Brazilians living in poverty declined from 35.7% in 2003 to 13.3% in 2014. However, according to a report published by the World Bank in 2018, related progress came to a halt in 2015. Between 2015 and 2016, the mean labour income for the poorest 30% of the population actually decreased, even as it increased for everyone else. Inequality in Brazil decreased significantly between 2000 and 2014 thanks to higher employment rates, higher real wages, and redistributive social assistance programs. According to a World Bank working paper published in 2014, Decomposing the Recent Inequality Decline in Latin America, Brazil’s improvement in labour income had accounted for nearly half of the reduction in inequality up to that point, as measured by the Gini coefficient; meanwhile government policies directed at education, health, and social assistance accounted for much of the improved conditions for Brazilians living in poverty during the period. Recent reductions in labour income, caused by a slowdown in economic growth, may therefore undermine efforts to maintain and advance equality in the country. Bolstering structural elements that can support long-term, sustainable improvements in living standards, such as the quality of education, the amount of household savings and investment, and the allocation of labour and capital markets, will be critical for spurring healthy economic growth and sustainable development.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.26"
"4.95","Breakdown of Trust","","In early 2018, the RAND Corporation published a report describing a phenomenon that the US-based think tank described as “Truth Decay.” According to the report, Americans’ reliance on facts to discuss public issues had declined significantly during the prior two decades, amid a blurring of fact and opinion, and an evaporation of trust in formerly respected sources of information. The report noted previous US eras of Truth Decay, including the rapid industrialization and inequality of the 1880s, the mistrust of financial institutions tied to the Great Depression of the 1930s, and the Viet Nam War-era 1960s - and found that the trend is even more pronounced now (the ends of previous periods of Truth Decay were marked by improved government transparency, changes in policy, and a resurgence of responsible investigative journalism, according to the report). Current symptoms of the decline in trust include a dip in voter turnout in the US, where just 58% of eligible voters turned out for the 2016 presidential election (a 20-year low), challenges posed in recent years by some European Union members states, such as Hungary and Poland, to the bloc’s established values, and a Brexit vote in the United Kingdom in 2016 that delivered a defeat to a government that hoped to remain in the EU.    There is a strong perception among many people that some established political leaders and international institutions have pursued an economic agenda based on the idea of free trade, and a social agenda based on the idea of the free movement of people across national borders, that have combined to create greater inequality, unemployment, and disruptive cultural change. A profound mistrust of institutions has surfaced, as people increasingly lose faith in governments seen as prioritizing business interests over the interests of individuals. According to the 2018 Edelman Trust Barometer, which is based on an online survey conducted in 28 countries during late 2017, the portion of the “informed public” expressing trust in non-governmental organizations slipped to 64% from 67% in the prior year, while the portion of those expressing trust in government remained flat at 53%. The Edelman report reflected a wide variety of sentiment recorded around the world; the average level of trust among the general population in the institutions of government, business, media, and non-governmental organizations registered at 74 percentage points in China, 49 in Canada, 43 in the US, and 36 in Russia.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.33"
"4.96","Building Climate Coalitions","","Effective climate action requires commitments from businesses, organizations, cities, and regions. Several coalitions have already emerged in the private sector. For example, We Mean Business, a coalition of non-profit organizations dedicated to partnering with the private sector, has engaged more than 800 different companies (representing about $17 trillion in market value), to act on climate change. More than 150 of the affiliated companies have committed to a goal of 100% renewable power, and about 500 have committed to establishing science-based targets for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases in their operations. Public-sector coalitions engaging local and regional governments are also becoming more prominent. The C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group is made up of more than 90 cities that have committed to 10,000 “actions” to combat climate change. C40 cities represent about one quarter of the global economy and roughly 8% of the world’s population, and aim to stir a global conversation that hastens progress towards a low-carbon economy. The Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy provides a similar platform for more than 9,000 cities, comprising about 10% of the world’s population. In the US, the We Are Still In coalition has gathered signatures from more than 3,500 leaders across the country in support of a pledge to uphold the Paris Agreement on climate change. This initiative, which was started after the Trump Administration announced its intention to withdraw the US from the agreement, represents about half the US population. Climate Action 100+ is meanwhile an example of a global initiative led by more than 300 investors with $32 trillion in assets under management; it is systematically engaging with major corporate greenhouse gas emitters around the globe that now have a significant opportunity to shape the clean energy transition and support the Paris Agreement - which aims to limit global warming to less than 2°C above pre-industrial levels. In addition, the World Economic Forum’s Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders aims to foster public-private collaboration that can support the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. By joining forces with these coalitions, policy-makers, organization, and companies can demonstrate a real commitment to climate action, share best practices, and demonstrate leadership.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.34"
"4.97","Building Peace","","After more than half a century of violence, the Colombian government and Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrillas reached a peace agreement in 2016. A revised peace deal was subsequently signed and ratified by congress, though critics argue that it provides excessive political and judicial benefits to former FARC leaders. The FARC, which has retained its acronym as a political party, performed poorly in national elections held in March 2018 - though it was guaranteed a handful of seats in congress as part of the peace agreement. In addition to guarantees for the political participation of ex-combatants, the peace agreement includes measures to support social and economic development in rural areas, to provide reparations, and to eliminate the illicit drug production that was one of the former guerrilla group’s main sources of funding. The end of the armed confrontation with the FARC promises to improve security and respect for human rights in Colombia, while curbing drug trafficking. A Colombian government study estimated that achieving peace would boost annual GDP growth by up to 0.3% over the following decade, thanks to increases in foreign and domestic investment, increased consumption, the redistribution of military resources, a tourism boost, and business expansion into more remote regions. The peacebuilding process also entails complex challenges. Dissident factions of the FARC have refused to demobilize. In addition, achieving the right balance between peace and justice, and integrating thousands of former combatants into society will require public faith in political processes, and efficient institutions. The government must increase its capacity to deliver basic social services across the country (in conflict-affected regions, in particular). Public-private partnerships should play a role in the process, by catalysing broad economic and employment growth. The Colombian government has estimated that the implementation of the peace agreement may involve spending the equivalent of 15% of GDP over the course of the coming decade. A truly comprehensive approach to improving domestic security in Colombia will also require dealing with the powerful criminal groups known as Bacrim - such as the Urabeños, and the still-active National Liberation Army (ELN). Government talks with the ELN resulted in a ceasefire, though the guerrilla group committed a series of attacks when the deal expired in January 2018, aimed at infrastructure and the military.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.35"
"4.98","Building Sustainable Industries","","The unintended consequences of human activity have placed the environment under extreme stress - and threaten to undermine future economic growth, and sustainable development. However, significant, widespread efforts to create a more circular economy, where materials are re-used and more waste is eliminated, are underway. For example, the lithium-ion battery industry, which is expected to grow dramatically in order to match increasing demand for electric vehicles and renewable energy storage, is working to clean up its supply chains, better safeguard workers, ban child labour, eradicate pollution, and promote re-use and recycling. Other industries must follow suit. Rapid population growth, increasing urbanization, and an expanding global middle class will place potentially catastrophic amounts of pressure on the environment, barring radical and responsible industrial reform. Enlightened companies recognize that reliable growth and long-term relevance are contingent upon pursuing social and environmental benefits that go far beyond traditional corporate social responsibility programmes. Cisco, for example, topped a 2018 Barron’s ranking of the most sustainable companies in the US, by reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 41% since 2007, getting to a point where 80% of its electricity is derived from renewable sources, and implementing initiatives like a training programme designed to place 1.3 million students in IT jobs. A strategic approach to accomplishments like this is crucial, in order to provide ways to unlock value. Such an approach is increasingly attractive to the investing community; a growing number of investors are signing on to United Nations guidelines that commit them to incorporating environmental, social, and governance criteria in their portfolio selection. In general, however, more efforts must be made to create conditions that genuinely incentivize and enable industries to grow sustainably.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.123"
"4.99","Business Disruption","","As a result of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the relationship between businesses and their customers is shifting to an on-demand, always connected model powered by digital communication. In early 2018, the Facebook-owned mobile communication service WhatsApp reported that its users were sending 60 billion messages every day, and when Chinese internet commerce giant Alibaba Group staged a “Singles Day” in 2015, it led to $14 billion of online transactions in China alone, with 68% of those sales completed through a mobile device. Places where connectivity has lagged are catching up; the GSM Association expects sub-Saharan Africa to add 240 million mobile internet users between 2014 and 2020. Businesses must understand the ways that products can have their value enhanced digitally. The electric car maker Tesla, for example, has deployed over-the-air software updates that help maintain the value of its cars after they have been purchased. New ways to value services can also be created. Analytics can be used to measure a service’s performance over time, for example, in order to improve the accuracy of pricing. For physical assets, too, such as an elevator, pricing could be based on performance over a given period, excluding the downtime required for maintenance. The Fourth Industrial Revolution is also spurring new forms of collaboration. Established incumbents often lack sensitivity to evolving customer needs, while younger firms are in need of the capital and rich data enjoyed by older counterparts. When firms share resources, significant value can be created for both parties as well as for broader economies. As they consider new partnerships, organizations will increasingly pivot to open operating models that can capitalize on network effects. One model that has proven as disruptive as it is profitable is the so-called platform strategy, designed to broaden influence by encouraging peers to build on top of a company’s established tools and infrastructure. According to a report published by Accenture in 2016, the top 15 public platform companies already represented $2.6 trillion in market capitalization worldwide. Regardless of the model they choose, organizations that focus on being flexible and open can position themselves within a fluid ecosystem of value creation, while lowering costs and making more efficient use of energy and automation.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","['1.55', '1.62']"
"4.100","Business Dynamism","","Bolivia’s performance in this area of the Index shows the greatest room for improvement in terms of the willingness of companies to embrace disruptive ideas, where it has a progress score (ranging from a poor mark of zero to a top mark of one hundred) of 27.10, resulting in a rank of 139th out of 140 countries; and in terms of the growth of innovative companies where it has a progress score of 33.30 that results in a rank of 133rd out of 140 countries. One indicator reflects a better performance: the cost of starting a business, where it has a progress score of 73.00 that results in a rank of 130th out of 140 countries.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.25"
"4.101","Business Integrity","","Recent cases of corporations acting without integrity have proven to be extremely costly, and have become so ingrained in public perception that the mere mention of these businesses will conjure unfavourable images for years to come. In June 2018, German authorities slapped a €1 billion fine on Volkswagen for installing software in diesel engines designed to cheat emissions tests. The company had already agreed to a $4.3 billion settlement with US regulators related to the same issue. Petrobras, the Brazilian oil giant once estimated to be the largest company in the Southern Hemisphere by market capitalization, is now much reduced in size; its name is now tied to the Car Wash corruption scandal, and many Brazilians view it as complicit in the derailing of their country’s development trajectory. Building integrity in business goes beyond merely avoiding large and costly scandals. While integrity is often considered in combination with compliance, as both offer strategies for getting employees to act in accordance with ethical standards, there is a difference. While compliance is top-down, draws on a language of rules, and encourages norms of obedience, integrity relies on bottom-up, participatory processes, willing employee engagement, and the internalization of moral codes. Fostering a culture of integrity has advantages over a culture of compliance. It develops greater internal cohesion and trust within teams, and improved prospects for the correction of problematic behaviour in the absence of oversight from senior management. Over time, companies that foster integrity are likely to become more attractive to individuals who value integrity in the workplace. Surveys of millennials suggest that such intangibles are given increasing weight by highly skilled young people when deciding where to build their careers. A report published by a University of Manchester professor in 2013 described the loss of public confidence in British banks between the early 1980s and 2009 as the biggest change ever recorded by the British Social Attitudes surveys, which had been conducted since 1983; the majority of the decline actually occurred prior to the global financial crisis. Other surveys show strongly negative public reactions to multinational corporations that pay taxes outside of the countries where they have a considerable presence, even if they do so legally. Such surveys present opportunities for business leaders to address the causes of public concern, and increased integrity in the corporate world can give businesses a greater voice in political and global affairs.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.37"
"4.102","Business Model Disruption","","Historically, the space sector was solely the domain of governments and large telecommunications companies. Satellites were large and expensive, and required years to develop and launch, while related technologies evolved over periods lasting decades. Related private sector activity was largely limited to television broadcasting. Now, more than 60 countries have more than 1,900 satellites in operation, and the bulk have commercial rather than military purposes. Some countries have granted private entities relative freedom by softening regulatory control; the private spaceflight company Virgin Galactic, for example, has received clearance from the US Federal Aviation Administration to operate. Still, it is common for commercial space startups to face an uncertain and burdensome regulatory environment, because governments have generally not yet determined how much freedom they want to grant. Many areas of space activity are subjected to suffocating regulatory regimes, or face a legal void - and the number of affected companies is expanding as space commerce becomes increasingly important. Government and defence industry spending helped trigger a flood of information technologies and related investment that is now increasingly being directed at commercial space ventures - thanks to increased commoditization and miniaturization driven by Moore’s Law (which dictates that an increasing number of transistors piled onto chips leads to smaller and more powerful devices). Cloud computing and cheaper processing power are enabling data analysis previously only available to governments, while 3D printing is enabling the building of structures in space that would not be possible to launch from Earth. Some of the startups innovating in the space sector include SpaceX and Blue Origin, which are attempting to make reusable launch vehicles a reality - and to dramatically reduce the cost of spaceflight. DigitalGlobe, PlanetIQ, and dozens of other companies are meanwhile trying to point the way forward in terms of how we use satellites to better understand the planet and human activity, and Planetary Resources, Deep Space Industries, and other private companies are attempting to extract resources such as water and minerals from the far reaches of the solar system with mining operations. These efforts could improve our collective odds of securing desperately needed natural resources that may soon be depleted on Earth.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.120"
"4.103","Business Model Innovation","","Many successful innovators are said to have re-written the rules of their industry - which usually means that they managed to change accepted practices, and to disrupt established relationships. Although not all business model innovation involves new technology, a lot of it has been driven by information and communications technologies that both enable the rapid reconfiguration of value networks and give rise to new forms of value creation. The internet has altered distribution channels (compare Netflix’s online content distribution with now-antiquated video rental stores), and enabled supply chain disintermediation; Dell and Amazon can now bypass traditional retail space and sell directly to consumers (according to a report published by Deloitte, a record annual total of 6,885 physical stores had already closed in the US during 2017 by December 1 of that year). The internet has also given rise to the “freemium” model for services and software; Dropbox, for example, makes basic file storage free but charges for additional capacity. Offshoring has also been a result, as things like basic IT functions move to relatively low-cost places like Bangalore. Another result: a proliferation of businesses, like Facebook, trafficking in personal data and advertising. Business model innovation often flows from a unique take on customer needs, and on the best ways to satisfy them. The idea of software-as-a-service, for example, represented by offerings like Salesforce tools for businesses or Gmail, was driven by firms that realized customers do not necessarily care about owning software outright. Customer needs, however, are multi-faceted and often poorly articulated, making it a challenge for firms to judge whether or not a business model innovation has delivered what people actually want. As Clayton Christensen wrote in his 1997 book The Innovator's Dilemma, disruptive innovation of any sort will often first gain traction with a customer base that is difficult to identify (which is why many firms fatally ignore the threat of disruptive innovation until it is too late). There is some evidence that business model innovation may provide greater competitive advantage, and shareholder returns, than product or service innovation. However, successful business model innovation often requires simultaneous change in multiple parts of an organization, the development of all new competencies, and, potentially, the cannibalization of existing products or services. ​","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.80"
"4.104","Business Model Shifts","","The increasing pace of life, technology innovation, and evolving customer expectations are creating demand for new business models that provide access to cars, rather than ownership - and this is already having an impact on vehicle sales volumes. Millennials, for example, have proven to be more pragmatic about car buying than previous generations, and have a relatively lower rate of car ownership. It is possible that we may have even reached peak auto sales, at least in developed markets. Sharing economy-related mobility services include e-hailing (US-based Uber, or China-based Didi), carpooling (France-based BlaBlaCar), and parking and fleet management (US-based Luxe or Netherlands-based LeasePlan). The technologies underpinning these services are empowering consumers, and challenging the traditional sales and servicing model relied upon by car dealerships. As urban populations expand - 66% of the world’s population will be living in cities by 2050, compared with 54% in 2014, according to a United Nations estimate - demand for urban transport and automobile access (if not automobile purchases) will only increase. That will present a new set of social and environmental challenges, which can be addressed with an intelligent mix of new operating models that are based on sharing and increased asset utilization. Relatively young companies are also applying technology innovation in order to revamp traditional auto industry models. The website TrueCar, for example, is bringing transparency to the new car-buying process by showing people how much others have paid for a car they are interesting in purchasing. Meanwhile a new generation of automotive insurers are offering peer-to-peer products that leverage social media in order to enable group purchasing of policies, thereby reducing administrative costs and dividing up risk.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.15"
"4.105","Canada and Global Trade","","Trade represented 64% of Canada’s Gross Domestic Product as of 2017, compared with less than 51% in 1987, according to World Bank data. Since 2000, Canada has been at the forefront of so-called preferential liberalization, or giving better trade terms to formal partners; it is the only country to have a trade deal with all (other) G7 members. Canada’s ability to increase global trade, attract foreign investment, and develop more ties with growing markets is key to its future economic growth. The Canadian government has singled out the Asia-Pacific region as a priority for future trade development. Currently, Canada’s exports to East Asia represent less than 10% of its total, however, and Canada’s share of China’s imports is declining. Declining foreign direct investment from China suggests that Chinese companies perceive a high cost of doing business in Canada, as well as a restrictive regulatory environment with significant domestic trade barriers - such as inter-provincial labour and trade restrictions. Beyond China, Canada signed the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) in 2016. The US later withdrew from the pact, though Canada and other remaining countries signed a revised, Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership in 2018. In 2018, the US announced it would impose tariffs on aluminium and steel imports from allies including Canada; Canada responded by announcing new tariffs on a range of US goods including whiskey and toilet paper. The US under Donald Trump has also overhauled the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. In 2016, the Canadian Government signed the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with the European Union, Canada’s second-most-important trading partner after the US. The agreement seeks to facilitate trade through expanded market access including for services, remove customs duties, and protect labelling that shows where a product is from. CETA covers a relatively broad scope of trade issues and strengthens market access for Canadian products into the EU, which is a much larger market than the US. However, before CETA can take full effect, national parliaments within the EU must also approve it. To date, a number of EU countries have ratified the deal, including Sweden, the Czech Republic, and Spain, according to the European Parliament.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.27"
"4.106","Canada and Sustainable Energy","","Canada is an established energy producer that exports uranium, oil, natural gas and electricity around the globe. Now, the country is working to wean its own domestic energy market from fossil fuels - which provided about 77% of the energy consumed domestically in 2015 (the remaining 23% came from hydropower, biomass, nuclear, wind and solar). Canada’s national figures hide profound differences among its provinces and territories, which have different energy resources at their disposal, and various ways of using resources to support their economies. Canada’s oil and gas sector has been a magnet for investment, with three provinces - Alberta, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Saskatchewan - producing 97% of all Canadian oil. At the same time, in 2013, British Columbia, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador and Québec generated hydro-electricity with emissions of less than 1 metric ton of CO2 equivalent per capita. Models that explore Canada’s energy future generally suggest that successfully moving to sustainable energy systems will rely on enhanced low-carbon electrification, deployment of alternative fuels, and better energy efficiency and conservation; currently, roughly one-third of Canada’s domestic energy is lost as it is converted to power various service technologies. Renewable energy resources abound in Canada. Calgary, Edmonton and Saskatoon, which currently rely on high-carbon sources of electricity, receive over 2,200 hours of sun per year. And when it comes to wind, the Pan-Canadian Wind Integration Study has indicated a potential for increased energy generation in all Canadian regions. Tidal and wave energy might become part of future energy mixes, while nuclear is another low-carbon option for both heat and power; it is a significant source of electricity in New Brunswick and Ontario. Advanced biofuels also show promise. They are now being demonstrated at commercial scale, with one major plant in operation in Alberta. Canada’s forestry sector, in particular, may benefit from a biorefinery strategy. Canada is targeting a 30% reduction in economy-wide green-house gas emissions from 2005 to 2030; in April 2017, the country’s government launched Generation Energy, a country-wide consultation on how energy systems could evolve to meet that climate change goal. Unique challenges include a carbon-intensive economic and social structure, which is the legacy of exploiting plentiful land and resources, and a large fossil fuel production sector that remains a source of wealth. Additionally, complex arrangements between governments and indigenous peoples can make coordinated action difficult.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.27"
"4.107","Canada on the International Stage","","Canada has played a proactive role in a number of efforts to improve general well-being and the environment around the world. The Canadian government has participated in international bids to support environmental protection, to improve international responses to conflict, crises, and disasters, to promote human rights, global health, and development, and to prioritize gender equality and women’s empowerment in international assistance. The government aims, for example, to promote what it has dubbed a “feminist international assistance policy,” in order to advance gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls.  In the area of climate change, Canada balances its own exploitation of fossil fuel resources with support for various international environmental measures. The country has signed the Paris Agreement on climate change, and joined the Climate & Clean Air Coalition. Due to its geographical location, Canada has a significant stake in the effective resolution of environmental issues that impact polar regions, including climate change, trans-boundary pollution, and ozone depletion. The Canadian government has also pledged to support the implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples - which aims to spur innovative transformation for domestic and international governmental institutions. In many ways, Canada’s international priorities are a reflection of the country’s own domestic commitments to promote human dignity, inclusive governance, and sustainable growth.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.27"
"4.108","Canada's Workforce and Talent","","Canada’s steady rise in employment is an immigration story. In 2016, for the first time, the country’s population of those 65 and older exceeded those under the age of 15. The greying trend has noticeably reduced the labour supply. Even female labour force participation, which rose considerably from the mid-1970s to the early 2000s, has since stabilized. In recent years, labour force growth has therefore rested on rising immigration. The number of arriving immigrants has risen from about 100,000 per year in the 1980s, to nearly 300,000 by 2010. Now, the government has set an annual immigration target in excess of 300,000. The quality of Canada’s workforce - its talent - is bolstered by a secondary school system that performs well. The most recent Programme for International Student Assessment ranked Canada 7th out of 70 places. However, a significant component of the workforce was educated elsewhere. Canada’s immigrants are mostly highly educated. Many, though, have neither French nor English as a mother tongue. The most recent Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) study, conducted in each country’s official languages, ranked Canada in roughly the middle of the 23 countries included. Immigrants, who were mostly tested in a language other than their mother tongue, pulled Canada’s score down a bit. Canada has one of the larger postsecondary sectors, consisting of universities, two- or three-year colleges and apprenticeships, in the OECD. Despite the sector’s overall strength, there are problems. Evidence suggests some disconnect between what the sector supplies and what employers need. The PIAAC found that about 25% of university graduates had much poorer cognitive skills than one would expect with that level of education. In addition, apprenticeships have a mixed history in Canada. A substantial, prolonged influx of immigrants with trade skills meant the country did not develop a strong apprenticeship system. Those who complete apprenticeships generally do well, however; their average yearly earnings in 2015 were almost CAD 70,000. The overall size of the apprenticeship sector is relatively small, and there is a widespread view among policy-makers that Canada would gain from a strengthened capacity to supply trade skills.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.27"
"4.109","Canada’s Infrastructure Development","","After a period of relatively low investment, Canada slipped to 25th place out of 140 countries in the infrastructure category of the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index for 2018, down from 10th place as of 2009. The country’s Advisory Council on Economic Growth has noted an estimated infrastructure funding shortfall ranging from CAD 150 billion to CAD 1 trillion, though the Canadian Public Policy Forum expects infrastructure spending at all levels of government to be between CAD 500 billion and CAD 750 billion over the next decade. Some of this spending has already begun, and the average age of Canada’s infrastructure is declining for the first time in a generation. The Canada Infrastructure Bank, charged with investing at least CAD 35 billion in revenue-generating infrastructure projects, is designed to operate at arm’s length from the government. The entity is supposed to attract private funding to infrastructure investment, and to serve as a centre of expertise. Currently, private ownership of infrastructure is comparatively low in Canada. Some innovative public-private partnerships have been completed successfully, however, such as the Canada Line rapid rail project in Vancouver. Others are in the works, such as the REM automated rail system in Montreal, which has the second-largest pension plan in Canada as its main investor. These projects reflect a sea change for Canada, towards large projects with an equity structure that could be attractive for large investors like pension funds. Consistently drawing in such private investors will require other changes. One example: while Canada's infrastructure is now almost exclusively maintained by tax revenue, the Canada Infrastructure Bank's focus on revenue-generating projects suggests a potentially far greater role for infrastructure funded by user fees in the future. The fee model could both promote private sector involvement, and reduce traffic jams by introducing costs similar to the congestion charges now levied on vehicles within certain areas of London and Singapore. The Canada Infrastructure Bank is intended to promote evidence-based decision-making, and collect and share data. And if it turns out to be sufficiently independent from government, it has the potential to greatly improve infrastructure decisions by insulating them from politics. It is not yet clear whether it will develop a national infrastructure plan, as other countries have. Even so, it is designed to catalyse private sector involvement, and ensure rigorous project development, execution, and operation.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.27"
"4.110","Canada’s Innovation Agenda","","Rohinton Medhora, the president of Canada-based think tank the Centre for International Governance Innovation, recently identified “a malaise in innovation.” Canadian productivity, he noted, had not improved in 20 years, and so-called total factor productivity - a central measure of the economic contribution of innovation - had been flat or even negative in recent years. An op-ed written in 2017 by Jim Balsillie, former co-CEO of BlackBerry-maker Research in Motion, for The Globe and Mail, pointed to Canada’s “reliance on outdated economic theories” as a reason for this shortcoming, and cited a need to better enable Canadian firms to retain intellectual property rights as they compete in major markets. Another Globe op-ed from 2017 advocated for standards that put Canadian technology at the heart of developments in diverse fields, university-industry partnerships that create deeply embedded knowledge that attracts firms to Canada (rather than selling its knowledge to other countries) and direct support from university alumni networks to help firms augment expertise and international intellectual property strategies. Canada has never had an innovation strategy, preferring instead to rely on trade agreements that open up markets but have an uncertain impact on innovation. There are signs that this blind spot is being addressed. Under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, in 2015 the Canadian Ministry of Industry was rebranded as the Ministry of Innovation, Science and Economic Development. In 2016, Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development Navdeep Bains launched consultations with the aim of developing a national Innovation Agenda, and the government’s 2017 budget included a call to develop an Intellectual Property Strategy. In 2018, the federal government announced the winners of an innovation funding program committing CAD 950 million to five industry consortiums drawn from hundreds of companies and research institutions - and focused on concepts such as artificial intelligence-powered supply chains, in order to help spark a “made-in-Canada Silicon Valley.” Canada ranked 18th out of 140 countries in the World Economic Forum’s 2018 Global Competitiveness Index in terms of its population’s digital skills, 2nd in terms of time required to start a business, and 18th in terms of patent applications per million people.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.27"
"4.111","Central Banks and Regulation","","The effects of the US subprime mortgage crisis spread rapidly throughout banks, markets, and corporate balance sheets, touching off a global calamity. More recently, the euro crisis reinvigorated fears of financial contagion. Systemic risk remains, and changes in monetary policy at the world’s most significant central banks are a potential source of volatility. Modern banking and capital markets cannot be understood without first understanding central banking and monetary policy. The Bank of Japan has a balance sheet equivalent in size to more than 70% of that country’s GDP, and quantitative easing (when a central bank buys up securities in an effort to lower interest rates) in the US and the United Kingdom has expanded the balance sheets at central banks in those economies to the equivalent of more than 30% of local GDP. In addition, low or negative-interest-rate central bank policies have impacted banking models, asset prices, and wealth inequality. Central banks face constant political pressure to keep interest rates low, but as rates inevitably rise it will have global consequences. That has spurred calls from many central bankers in emerging markets to prepare by coordinating national policies. There is a need for more effective financial regulation, and central banks have addressed this to some degree by expanding their mandates to include safeguarding financial stability. They do this by setting capital and leverage requirements, and requiring banks deemed too big to fail to undergo stress tests. The more stringent regulation in recent years has led many financial institutions to reconsider their business models, and lower shareholder expectations for returns. Meanwhile regulators have their own reasons for concern; the growing prevalence of non-bank financial intermediaries has become an issue, for example. The concentration of risk they represent could trigger significant shocks during a period of distress - which could in turn be compounded if financial institutions trade in a manner that is similar to one another. In addition, financial firms are still free to engage in so-called regulatory arbitrage; the amount of protective capital a bank needs to stockpile might be different in one country than in another, for example. Roughly a decade after the financial crisis, there have been shifts towards financial deregulation - most notably in the US. While that is intended to bolster economic growth, it may come at the expense of long-term stability.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.18"
"4.112","Challenges to Governing Institutions","","The industrialized, global economy was built on a platform of hierarchical institutions: legislatures, regulatory agencies, courts, and international bodies such as the United Nations and the World Trade Organization. These grew in sophistication and scope throughout the 20th century. Still, in the developing world, they frequently struggle to deliver the same benefits realized in more advanced legal environments - often due to corruption and limited resources. Weak governance is widely recognized as a critical factor in the failure of economic development. Even in advanced settings, the traditional institutional framework is under duress - as the capacity for deliberative, expertise-based public bureaucracies to govern increasingly complex economic and social systems is limited. Change happens at a rate much faster than most formal institutions can move, and the gap between the data and technology available to private industry and that available to governments puts regulators at a major disadvantage; the Volkswagen emissions scandal of 2015, where the company was found to have installed technology in engines that could dupe regulators, was evidence of this. Technologies are generally developing with a speed and sophistication that it is beyond the ability of publicly-funded bureaucracies to monitor with 20th century regulation. Governing institutions are under pressure. Global supply chains, international capital markets, and digital networks limit the abilities of nation state-based governments with territorial authority. Meanwhile international governing institutions are generally under threat. The US has withdrawn or threatened to withdraw from international trade and climate agreements, and Great Britain is withdrawing from the European Union. In addition, the rise of nationalist, anti-immigrant, and anti-globalization forces has destabilized conventional policy-making, while mass migration in response to economic need and violence has created mounting challenges for democratic governments. Polarized politics within the US and the EU make governance even more uncertain. All of this upheaval is fuelled by technology that is transforming what we need and expect from laws and regulation. The dramatic rise of social media, for example, has amplified voices and views well outside of the mainstream - while attacks on traditional media undermine our ability to achieve a common understanding of facts. Cyberattacks by independent hackers and governments have manipulated political opinion and election results, de-legitimizing leaders and electoral outcomes - while data-driven management tools have reduced demand for conventionally-trained workers, and injected greater insecurity into employment. That has widened inequality, and frayed the social contract essential for trust in government.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.90"
"4.113","Changing Demographics","","The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is home to a young, literate, and aspirational population; growing urbanization and prosperity mean consumers there are demanding higher-quality products and services. The consultancy BCG estimates that Indonesia’s population of middle class and affluent will top 140 million by 2020, which presents an opportunity for businesses hoping to tap growing consumer markets. However, this is not necessarily a straightforward proposition throughout ASEAN, as demographic trends vary greatly across the region. Singapore has a wealthy but ageing population, where the number of people over the age of 65 is set to double by 2030, according to the Singaporean Department of Statistics. Meanwhile Indonesia’s young population is a promising sign for ASEAN economic growth, though creating good jobs for the millions of young people joining that country’s workforce is a challenge. Regional high unemployment rates and variation in the standard of living could lead to pockets of social unrest. Within the Philippines, for example, in 2017 the Southern Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao had a regional GDP per capita of $571, while the National Capital Region around Manila had a regional GDP per capita of $8,703, according to data from the Philippine Statistics Authority. Governments must help prepare young people to meet the demands of an increasingly integrated economic region. Current efforts by ASEAN countries may not be adequate. For example, Indonesia allocated only 3.6% of its GDP to public education in 2015, according to World Bank data, despite having one of the region’s youngest populations. ASEAN members also differ in terms of urbanization. As of 2015, about 20% of the population in Cambodia was urbanized, compared with more than 50% in Thailand and almost 75% in Malaysia, according to the World Bank. As more people migrate to cities such as Manila or Jakarta in search of better opportunities, they place added pressure on infrastructure and job markets. Related issues ranging from affordable housing, to low-cost, quality healthcare and education call for ASEAN governments to work closely with private sector and non-government organizations. Every development in the ASEAN region needs to be calibrated to meet local demographic particularities, and governments need to be sensitive to local needs while promoting greater international collaboration. Businesses may have to invest now, in order to one day reap the benefit of ASEAN’s rising young generation.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.2"
"4.114","Changing Energy Landscape","","Oil has underpinned the socio-economic development of Saudi Arabia for decades, while ensuring abundant government revenue via exports. The kingdom boasts 16% of the world’s proven oil reserves, according to the US Energy Information Administration, it has the world’s largest crude oil production capacity, and it is the biggest exporter of total petroleum liquids (three-quarters of the value of all of its exports were accounted for by petroleum exports as of 2016). Recently, however, geopolitical and global energy market developments have created uncertainty for the Saudi economy. Increasingly, natural gas is being used for power generation, while the declining cost of renewable energy technologies has made sustainable power more economically viable. Mobility, in the form of cars and public transportation, is meanwhile being electrified. The Paris Agreement on climate change, which entered into force in 2016, has much of the world moving more aggressively towards a low-carbon economy. Saudi Arabia’s own domestic energy dynamic has also affected its finances; while local energy demand has grown steadily over the past decade, fuel subsidies cost the Saudi government an estimated $61 billion in 2015. The World Economic Forum’s 2017 Energy Architecture Performance Index, which measures energy system performance in terms of environmental sustainability, access, and security, ranked Saudi Arabia 121st out of 127 countries. The kingdom has made significant progress in terms of where it needs the price of oil to trade on global markets in order for the country to balance its budget. In addition, it aims to diversify the fuels used for electricity generation (in part to free up oil for export), and to better monetize its natural gas reserves. Saudi Aramco, the national oil giant, has indicated plans to invest in developing shale gas resources. While an initial public offering of shares in Saudi Aramco had been expected to raise a significant amount of funding for further economic diversification efforts (among other things), the offering has since been put on hold. The ultimate success of efforts to diversify will depend on market conditions, the long-term resolve of the government, the transparency and perceived fairness of reforms, and adequate communication with both the public and the private sector.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.117"
"4.115","Chemical Restructuring","","In a world where resource consumption is coming under increasing public scrutiny, companies in the chemical and materials sector have been pushed to find new ways to grow. The sustained pace of mergers and acquisitions activity between 2015 and 2018 was both an indication of structural changes afoot in the industry, and of the increased need for these transactions as sources of growth. Consolidation, the expansion of product portfolios, and efforts to specialize are major M&A drivers, with the highest rates of activity observed among commodities, fertilizer, and agricultural chemicals businesses. M&A has been one means for growth in an environment of declining margins, product commoditization, and growing competition in emerging markets. However, it has proven to be insufficient to drive sustainable growth. In 2019, M&A activity is expected to continue apace, albeit differently - by shifting to a situation where more mid-sized companies are acquiring the non-core assets of mega-companies, in a strategic way that fits their well-defined portfolios and business models. Meanwhile a great deal of attention will be focused on the expected mega-deals like Sinochem Group's merger with China National Chemical Corporation (ChemChina).   Social expectations, regulation, and new technologies are all affecting chemical and materials firms. The concept of the circular economy, where materials are re-used rather than disposed of, is increasingly gaining traction; the Circular Economy Package introduced in the European Union in 2018 is accelerating the recycling of waste plastics, and the use of recycled plastic content in new products. Some plastics materials suppliers are keying on this trend by exploring models that incorporate recycling facilities into their operations (for example, Borealis’ acquisition of Ecoplast Kunststoffrecycling in 2018). In parallel, many large oil and gas companies have invested in petrochemical capacity, and their ”crude oil-to-chemicals” businesses are expected to have a significant impact. Several related projects are being constructed or planned in Saudi Arabia and Asia. Integration, alliances, and organic growth will still be important parts of the industry - though additional research and development capacity will be needed in order to guarantee economic sustainability, and to help chemical companies recover their status as innovation leaders. Profit opportunities may be found in R&D breakthroughs that help respond to challenges like poor air quality and energy efficiency, and to greater needs to reduce waste while expanding the use of technologies like sensors and robotics.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.28"
"4.116","Chemical and Materials Sustainability","","The environmental sustainability of the chemical and materials industry is already a significant concern in many wealthy countries, and is increasingly a concern in Asia. In China, environmental standards are becoming more stringent, and emissions restrictions are helping to shut down thousands of operating sites every year. While curbing emissions and discharges is essential, the industry must also generally become able to utilize resources more responsibly and efficiently. The industry, after all, is a critical factor for countries that are trying to meet their obligations regarding mitigating and adapting to climate change. Companies have generally been using energy and materials more efficiently and making sustainability a part of their product innovation. The sector is also enabling other industries to follow through on their own sustainability commitments, in the form of solutions for energy-efficient buildings, sustainable transportation, and water purification, and in terms of exploring alternative feedstocks and biotechnology processes. In addition, the sector is developing more transparent and accurate ways to assess the sustainability of production. Demand for more credible and verifiable analysis tools will only increase. The concept of the circular economy, where materials are reused and recycled rather than disposed of, is gaining significant political and industry momentum. The chemical and materials industry is best positioned to contribute to this through innovation that helps address mounting concern regarding plastics pollution, for example. Every year, millions of tons of plastic are disposed of, and a very small fraction is recycled. Related pollution may only get worse as plastics production further expands. Addressing the issue of plastics pollution requires global, coordinated action from both the public and private sectors. The chemical and materials industry should help define a new plastics economy, where materials do not end up in a landfill or in the oceans. In order to do this, the industry has to work hand-in-hand with governments in order to help devise policies that enable a truly circular economy of plastics, and mitigate environmental vulnerability.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.28"
"4.117","Chemical and Materials Talent","","The chemical and materials industry faces two serious challenges when it comes to its workforce: the first is a need to redefine and adapt in the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and its associated evolving technologies, and the second is related to attracting and retaining talent. The technological transformation of work is changing reality for millions of workers and companies, and the chemical and materials industry is no exception. Technologies like robotics and artificial intelligence are creating exciting opportunities in terms of productivity for businesses, and in the ways that they can replace unhealthy, dangerous, and repetitive tasks with high-skilled labour. In order to best take advantage of related opportunities and minimize risks, a redefinition of work is required across the industry, and proactive collaboration between governments and companies is necessary. Industry leaders generally see a shortage of the right skills as one of their most serious challenges when it comes to keeping up with innovation. Most of these leaders therefore recognize a need to foster different skill sets in order to make their organizations more agile, and better equipped to embrace new technology developments as they arrive. For incumbent players in the industry to be able to fully exploit Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies to maximum benefit, there is an urgent need to invest in employees. Organizations are exploring mechanisms to develop and acquire the right skill sets, to enhance diversity, and to develop greater agility within their workforces - though these same organizations sometimes struggle to identify which key competencies they will need in the future. According to the results of a survey published by the American Chemistry Council and Accenture Talent Management in 2016, recruiting and retaining top talent was a major concern for the industry and a high priority for management; 87% of respondents highlighted the fact that the industry is suffering from a perception (or image) issue, which can make it unattractive to new graduates. Companies in the sector have to recognize the need to rethink their workforce models in ways that can better attract and retain the sort of employees who can help boost their performance in the future.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.28"
"4.118","Circular Business Models","","People are increasingly embracing businesses that see them as users, rather than consumers - by enabling them to access services rather than having to own the products that deliver the services. As these business models move away from ownership, they are moving towards performance-based models underpinned by reusable products. Enabled by new technologies, these businesses have expanded quickly. BlaBlaCar, the French ride-sharing company, grew from a presence in one country in 2006 to 22 countries, and 25 million members, by 2016. And, according to Robin Chase's 2015 book Peers Inc., by its fourth year of operation AirBnB was already able to offer 650,000 rooms, compared with the 645,000 rooms made available by the Intercontinental Hotel Group by its 65th year. Rental and performance-based companies are generally able to support their pay-per-use customers with remote assistance; Bundles, for example, offers high-end washing machines for rent in the Netherlands, including installation and maintenance, in order to limit the prevalence of high-energy-use machines that are discarded after short periods. These success stories have pushed more businesses to develop sharing models and extend them into new markets. The worldwide number of carsharing service members reached nearly 24 million by 2017, for example, and is projected to total nearly 61 million by the end of 2022, according to a report published in 2018 by market research firm Berg Insight; by that point, the total carsharing fleet should include more than 700,000 cars, according to the report. An analysis published by the consultancy BCG showed that the number of sharing economy-related, venture capital-backed startups in the world (ranging from pet sitting to workspaces) increased to 420 by 2016, from 40 in 2007. Emerging markets are increasingly hotbeds of sharing economy activity, thanks to growing smartphone use in these areas - 81% of respondents to a BCG survey in India had used Uber, according to the analysis, and 93% had used Ola Cabs, an India-based company. The rate at which these business models are expanding has strong implications for the broader adoption of circular economy principles, which are designed to enable the use of technology to minimize the negative impact of consumption.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.31"
"4.119","Circular Materials Economy","","Resource scarcity, and the need for better environmental responsibility, have long served as motivation for sound materials use. Now more than ever before, the principles of a so-called circular economy - where materials are re-used rather than disposed of - need to be included in all of the stages of materials fabrication and utilization. To that end, new sustainable sources of raw materials, and methods for recycling, are being actively sought out and developed. The landscape for the sourcing of the critical mineral components for use in high-tech devices is being changed by the advent of new processes such as bio-mining, where the use of modern gene editing technologies enable the manipulation of organisms in a way that increases extraction yields. The chemical and physical transformation of raw materials into functional forms should always take sustainability into account; one positive example of this in action is the use of agricultural crops such as maize being made into biodegradable polymers for packaging, and being integrated into the production of new medical devices. 3D printing, and manufacturing in general, will likely continue to be optimized in order to better reduce waste - while techniques such as self-assembly (the putting together of final products, like a piece of Ikea furniture) and biosynthesis may open up new avenues. However, for a true materials-related circular economy to flourish, it is important that we eliminate the concept of ""end-of-life,"" especially for metals. Urban mining initiatives are now complementing established (but insufficient) efforts related to recovery and re-purposing metals - as waste streams are increasingly becoming clogged with discarded electronics and other potentially functional systems. For soft matter, biological degradation may see a renaissance due to an enhanced ability to modify organisms capable of breaking chemical linkages; however, additional research is required, especially in the development of new enzymatic systems. Technologies like blockchain may enable a more accurate traceability of materials through their entire lifecycle, informing us with greater accuracy about the sustainability of substances. Closed-loop systems, water re-use, and low carbon emissions from industrial processing are lingering challenges for the extractive and transformative industries. As dynamism increases due to rapid technological change and demand for new applications, the materials sector should take every opportunity to develop a more circular economy.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.4"
"4.120","Civic Space","","The importance of civil society and civic space to the health of society has long been recognized. Charities, citizen’s groups, religious associations, trade unions and other non-governmental organizations play a critical role in protecting rights, enhancing good governance,, and fostering pluralism. The scope of civic space is affected by infringements of a number of rights. Of these, three in particular are notable: the right of peaceful assembly, the right to associate with others, and the right to freely express and exchange opinions. Without these rights, civil society and civic participation cannot flourish. However, the scope of civic space has been restricted in recent years. CIVICUS’ annual State of Civil Society Report 2017 documented the pressure, across states, on civic space and civil society. Threats emanate most obviously from the state itself, but also from private security forces, business actors and organized crime. The report details the introduction of a range of measures that restrict the funding, organization and activities of civil society organizations; physical and verbal attacks on activists, journalists and NGO representatives; and a creeping criminalization of legitimate activities. As often occurs, repressive measures in one state are replicated by others. Indeed, to focus on measures that relate to the funding and activities of civil society organizations, an n April 2017 Comment by the Council of Europe’s Commissioner for Human Rights noted that since 2012, more than 60 countries have passed or drafted laws seeking to impose greater restrictions. Limits on international funding, the imposition of excessive administrative and bureaucratic requirements, and harsh licensing processes are increasingly popular. Measures of this kind gravely threaten civic space. These measures have prompted a range of responses from other states and international bodies. For instance, the European Parliament’s Directorate-General for External Policies published a policy document in early 2017 setting out the ways that the EU can respond to shrinking civil society space. But these developments also raise the question of the role of business. Of course, at a minimum, business should neither undertake nor be complicit in repressive measures and actions that threaten civil society and civic space. This is entrenched in the United Nations Human Rights Council’s Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and other private and public regulatory frameworks. But beyond this, recent commentary has emphasized the ways that business can play a more proactive role in this context. For instance, the 2016 Beyond Integrity report, published by the Charities Aid Foundation together with academics from the London School of Economics, argued that companies ought to use their influence with governments to protect civic space. It sets out ways that civil society actors can build commitment from business, and steps that business can take to build capacity in order to defend civil society. Likewise, a report published in December 2015 by the Institute for Human Rights and Business examined how business can engage with human rights activists and leverage their influence to push back against the pressure on civic space. Its recommendations included measures aimed at improving internal operating procedures, establishing dialogue with affected communities and organizations, and intervening in individual cases of government abuse. The protection of civil society and civic space will be critical in the upcoming decade. Business has an important role to play in responding to new challenges.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.73"
"4.121","Climate Action in Latin America","","Latin America accounted for only about 5% of global carbon emissions as of 2017, according to the Global Carbon Project - compared with the roughly 15% of emissions generated by the US, and the roughly 27% generated by China. However, the region has traditionally relied on natural resource-intensive industries including agriculture, mining, and forestry. Resource-intensive growth and rapid urbanization have exacerbated environmental issues including habitat loss, contamination, and water shortages - while driving unsustainable demand on the energy sector. Additionally, heightened vulnerability to impacts of climate change such as extreme weather events, drought, and sea-level rise have raised concerns about population displacement, food security, and damaged infrastructure. Two of the highest-ranking locations in the Germanwatch Global Climate Risk Index published in 2018, Puerto Rico and Dominica, are located in the region (both had been severely hit by hurricane Maria in late 2017). According to the index, which measures the impact of extreme weather events, Puerto Rico suffered roughly $82 billion related losses in 2017, equivalent to about 63% of the US territory’s GDP.  Latin America is considered a global leader on Paris Agreement commitments - 14 countries from the region were among the first to ratify the deal, which was adopted in 2015 and aims to limit warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. According to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, multiple countries from the region include carbon pricing mechanisms in climate action plans submitted as part of the agreement. According to a report published in 2016 by the International Finance Corporation, low-carbon investments including those made in climate-resilient infrastructure and in clean, renewable energy represent a “trillion dollar opportunity” in Latin America. Brazil alone represents $152 billion in renewable energy investment opportunity by the year 2030, according to the report. Greater international collaboration and coordination among local civil society groups, as well as strong monitoring and reporting mechanisms, will be necessary to follow through on related commitments.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.92"
"4.122","Climate Change Impacts","","The oceans are being hit hard by climate change. Effects include ocean warming, ocean acidification, and oxygen depletion. A future ocean that is hotter, more acidic, and a more difficult place for ocean life to breathe presents serious challenges. The oceans have absorbed more than 90% of the heat produced via greenhouse gas-associated warming since the 1970s - and according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the five warmest years on record have all occurred since 2010. Ocean life is largely accustomed to stable temperatures, and is vulnerable to related changes. Coral reefs, for example, which can house millions of species, are being bleached from overheating. Back-to-back extreme ocean heat waves in 2016 and 2017 caused massive bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Australia, killing half of its coral. Potential related economic impacts, not to mention environmental impacts, are significant - a 2013 Deloitte study found that the Great Barrier Reef was generating about $7 billion in revenue for Australia, largely via tourism. As an ocean warms, its oxygen levels drop. Oxygen content in the oceans declined by an estimated 2% between 1960 and 2010, according to a study published in the journal Nature in 2017. In addition, since the First Industrial Revolution, the acidity of the oceans has increased by roughly 30% as a result of carbon dioxide dissolving in marine waters; this makes it more difficult for many organisms to form healthy skeletons and shells. Scientists from the University of British Columbia's Institute for the Oceans and Fisheries have predicted that if climate change continues unchecked, global fisheries may suffer $10 billion in annual revenue loss by 2050. Global warming-driven sea level rise may be the most impactful form of ocean-related climate change - scientists predict that half of the population in 25 megacities (cities with more than 10 million inhabitants) will be affected by sea level rise if climate change is not slowed; Miami, Shanghai and dozens of other cities have already suffered related effects. Climate change must be aggressively checked in order to enable natural adaptation and evolution, and scientists typically agree that the best way to do this is to confront the difficult task of directly reducing global carbon emissions.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.103"
"4.123","Climate Change Science and the Arctic","","The Arctic is warming at least twice as fast as the rest of the planet. A rapidly-changing climate has many ripple effects, from declining food supplies and new strains on indigenous communities, to the opening up of new shipping routes and natural resource development amid melting ice and infrastructure damage. Climate change does not happen in isolation - warming in the Arctic can multiply the impacts of climate change felt globally. Arctic sea ice plays a critical role in moderating Earth’s climate, for example, and research suggests that periods of extreme cold in North America and Europe are tied to changes in the jet stream partially attributable to declines in Arctic sea ice. The high “albedo,” or reflective capacity of sea ice enables it to reflect solar radiation instead of absorbing energy and accelerating surface warming. Sea ice with snow cover can reflect up to 90% of solar energy, which preserves ice for longer periods, according to the National Snow & Ice Data Center in the US. The loss of Arctic sea ice therefore means the ocean is absorbing more solar energy, causing water temperatures to increase and triggering a feedback loop of more melting. Sea ice also influences ocean circulation, as freshwater from melting ice disturbs the density of the thermohaline currents that keep Earth’s temperatures stable. Record lows for the extent of Arctic sea ice are regularly being broken; the four lowest maximum ice cover measurements ever were taken between 2015 and 2018. Warmer temperatures have also made Arctic areas more prone to wildfires, which release sooty black carbon and carbon dioxide that exacerbate climate change (the historic Arctic wildfires in summer 2019 produced the equivalent to Sweden’s total yearly carbon dioxide emissions). In addition, particulate matter from fires can cover ice, diminish its reflective capacity and cause more melting. Thawing permafrost (frozen ground) presents another destabilizing feedback loop, by releasing methane (among other greenhouse gases) into the atmosphere that is capable of trapping more heat than carbon dioxide. Each of these feedback loops is amplified by the fact that a warming Arctic enables more oil and gas extraction, which in turn contributes to climate change and worsens the impacts already being felt both in the Arctic and elsewhere.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.10"
"4.124","Climate Change and Ecosystems","","Climate change is affecting the availability and quality of water resources. On an increasingly warm planet, extreme and irregular weather events such as floods and drought are expected to become more frequent. Warmer river and lake temperatures will reduce the amounts of dissolved oxygen contained in freshwater, and make habitats more lethal for the fish that rely on it to breathe. Warming waters are also more prolific incubators of harmful algae that is toxic for aquatic life and for humans. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C, published in late 2018, noted that by limiting the global average temperature increase to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels, instead of 2°C, we could significantly reduce the risk of severe negative outcomes for ecosystems and human development. For example, at a limited 1.5°C temperature increase, sea level rise by the year 2100 would be 10 centimetres lower than it would be at a 2°C increase - posing less of a threat to coastal cities, and lessening the risk of severe heat waves and torrential storms. A mere half-degree of extra warming, at a 2°C increase, would also mean a ten-fold increase in ice-free summers in the Arctic, and a doubling of the rate of crop loss, according to the report. The report also identified important links between climate change and safe drinking water access - but cautioned that socio-economic factors like governance and wealth also play significant, related roles. Ecosystems such as tropical forests, ocean systems and corals, and wetlands are particularly vulnerable. More extreme variation in terms of rainfall and drought are likely in both a 1.5°C-rise and 2°C-rise scenario; in many cases, that will lessen the quality and quantity of water available for agriculture and other human activity. Limiting warming to 1.5°C will be difficult, but possible, according to the IPCC report, though it indicated that more breakthroughs in terms of carbon sequestration may be necessary to complement existing efforts to reduce emissions. Implementing emerging technologies and adaptation practices can help reduce the vulnerability of people and the environment to climate change, and help to increase the resilience of water resources and systems. Further research is needed, in order to increase awareness and understanding of climate change and to better adapt to a changing environment.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.134"
"4.125","Climate Impact in Viet Nam","","Viet Nam is among the most vulnerable countries when it comes to suffering from the effects of climate change. It ranked 8th on a list of countries most impacted by climate change between 1997 and 2016 compiled by the think tank Germanwatch, with more than 300 related deaths and an estimated $2 billion in related damage. A combination of extreme drought (the worst recorded in a century, which brought the Mekong river to its lowest level since 1926), and natural disasters has wreaked havoc in the country, according to Germanwatch. Projected increases in population, urbanization, and economic growth will all only place more pressure on the environment and natural resources. Energy-inefficient growth has increased greenhouse gas emissions, and undermined the sustainability of economic development. Projections show that by the end of the 21st century, about 40% of the Mekong Delta will be submerged under water, as will one fifth of Ho Chi Minh City, the country’s biggest population centre and a vital economic engine. At least one in ten people in Viet Nam are expected to be directly affected by these changes, which would come at a cost equivalent to about 10% of the country’s GDP. Other environmental factors, including deforestation, the uncontrolled exploitation of natural resources, and the decline of underground water supply are profoundly affecting development. Viet Nam lost more than one third of its area under mangrove cover between 1983 and 2012, due to expanded shrimp farming, industrial development, and increased urbanization - which has in turn increased vulnerability to tidal surges and hurricanes, and to water salinity, according to a report published in 2017 by researchers from the University of Leeds, Vietnam National University, the Institute of Marine Sciences in Zanzibar, and the Centre for Advanced Amazonian Studies in Brazil. In addition, the supply and quality of water have been greatly affected by climate change. The Vietnamese government has sought to address climate change for decades, and has actively participated in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (1994) and the Kyoto Protocol (2002). In 2005, the country passed an environmental protection law, and subsequently approved national targets for adapting to climate change. The government has also sought to generally increase awareness about the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and to shift the country’s economic model from one that relies heavily on fossil fuels to one that better utilizes renewable energy sources.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.132"
"4.126","Climate Impact on Nigeria","","Nigeria has experienced the blunt impact of climate change. According to the Global Climate Risk Index 2018 compiled by the non-profit Germanwatch, Nigeria suffered 77 climate-related fatalities in 2016, and about $94 billion in climate-related losses. Flooding has resulted in property destruction and injury, widespread infection, vector-borne diseases, food insecurity, and ravaged farmland. Given that Nigeria is still a developing country of nearly 200 million people, the majority of whom are poor and uneducated, a broad appreciation of the impacts of climate change might not be possible. This problem might be further exacerbated by limited planning and a reactive approach on the part of the government to climate change mitigation. Urgent action is required, as related impacts are only becoming more devastating. By September 2018, nearly 200 people in the country had been killed by flooding in the year to date, and thousands had been displaced. The government declared a national disaster that month, and the country’s two major rivers - the Niger and the Benue - burst their banks and swept away homes. By November 2018, a Red Cross official reported that flooding was so extensive in some areas of Nigeria that it was impossible to see dry land on the horizon. While Nigeria’s federal government seems to appreciate the challenges stemming from climate change, a concrete, comprehensive plan to address the problem has yet to be developed and implemented. However, there have been some encouraging signs. The federal government’s Department of Climate Change, which was established within the Federal Ministry of the Environment in 2011, has established programs for the implementation of a 20% unconditional reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, and for the issuance of green bonds meant to finance low-carbon opportunities. In addition, Nigeria is a party to the 2016 Paris Agreement on climate change, which aims to limit the global temperature rise to well below 2°C above preindustrial levels. Meanwhile individuals and civil society organizations in Nigeria are making related efforts. The Climate Change Network of Nigeria, a non-profit coalition of more than 150 civil society organizations, was formed in 2007 and has sought to galvanize collaboration between the public and private sectors.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.101"
"4.127","Collective Action","","A low-corruption environment is a public good. Once established, low levels of corruption are there for everyone to enjoy. But generating a low-corruption environment where one does not already exist is extremely challenging, not least because even when corruption is widespread, corrupt transactions tend to be concealed from all except those who are directly involved. Fighting corruption is in the collective interest, and requires collective action. It does not follow, however, that it is in anyone’s individual interest to be the first to take a stand where corruption is widespread. In systemically corrupt societies, solo efforts on the part of civil society activists, businesses or NGOs are likely to meet some form of punishment, and are unlikely to achieve lasting success. That is why coordinated, group action is needed for anti-corruption drives, in order to create a real chance of fostering genuine change. As more relevant actors participate, individual costs of participation are reduced, and the odds of success rise - and, it becomes in more actors’ interests to join the effort to create a low-corruption environment. This logic underpins initiatives where different actors club together and promise to abide by shared anti-corruption policies. For example, companies have publicly committed to anti-bribery policies in accordance with Transparency International’s Business Principles for Countering Bribery. Many banks have partnered with the Joint Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce, which has instigated thousands of bank-led investigations of clients suspected of money laundering. Shipping companies sign up to the principles of the Maritime Anti-Corruption Network, while mining companies adhere to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). Coordinated responses to corruption can be impaired by uncooperative agents, however. As a public good, low corruption environments do not exclude those who do not contribute to their establishment; free-riding off of others’ efforts can therefore cause problems. If one member of a group seeks preferential treatment by offering bribes behind other members’ backs, it can damage the net effectiveness of group action. Sanctioning by naming and shaming, suspension, or expulsion from a group are strategies that both the EITI and the anti-money-laundering Financial Action Task Force employ. The G20/B20 platform is a great example of the far-reaching impact that public-private collective action can have. The G20 Anti-Corruption Working Group has provided a number of recommendations for member countries that commit to fighting corruption, including tools to build a capacity to combat corruption and to foster integrity initiatives.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.37"
"4.128","Combatting Climate Change","","The Paris climate change conference in 2015 saw countries adopt the first-ever universal, legally binding global climate deal (which was generally viewed as a significant French diplomatic success). As a member of the European Union, France shares the EU’s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution, and has committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to at least 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. The French economy is not particularly carbon-intensive, as it accounts for only 1.2% of global greenhouse gas emissions while contributing the equivalent of about 4% of global annual GDP. Total energy-related carbon dioxide emissions and per capita emissions in France are relatively low compared with other G20 countries, and are steadily declining. The country’s low carbon intensity stems from its use of nuclear power and hydro energy for electricity generation. However, in order to achieve its voluntary 2020 objectives established as part of the Paris Agreement, and to remain on track to limit warming well below 2°C above preindustrial levels, France must significantly reduce its consumption of fossil fuels; the country ranked 15th in the Climate Change Performance Index for 2018, which identified significant gaps in the implementation of policies at the national level. The French Minister for the Ecological and Inclusive Transition set a target of carbon neutrality, or net zero carbon emissions, by 2050. Sectors that emit the most greenhouse gas include transportation (28% of national emissions) and heating (20% of emissions), according to the Ministry of Ecological and Inclusive Transition. Fossil fuels still account for more than two-thirds of final energy consumption in the country, and the government aims to phase coal out of the electricity sector by no later than 2023, and to ban the sale of cars that run on gasoline and diesel starting in 2040. Currently, 75% of the electricity produced in France comes from nuclear, and roughly three quarters of the country’s nuclear capacity is expected to wind down operations during the 2020s. The need to plan new capacity, or at least revamp existing capacity, is critical. The share of renewable energy in France’s total energy supply has been increasing slowly during the past decade, but is still relatively low compared with other G20 members. Renewables represented about 13% of the country’s total energy consumption as of 2015, according to World Bank data, compared with less than 9% as recently as 2006.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.56"
"4.129","Commodities and Supply Chains","","The Consumer Goods Forum, an industry association, estimates that four agricultural commodities - beef, palm oil, paper and pulp, and soy - account for about half of all tropical deforestation. Demand for these commodities is only expected to increase, particularly in emerging markets. Public-private partnerships like the New York Declaration on Forests, which aims to halve the rate of deforestation by 2020, the 2010 Consumer Goods Forum, which pledges to achieve zero net deforestation by 2020, and the Tropical Forest Alliance 2020 have set ambitious goals; however, a more precise understanding of related social and environmental risks presented by supply chains is required. More clarity is needed on links between agricultural expansion and forest impacts, for example. Monitoring systems can facilitate the implementation of protection efforts, while increased transparency can encourage accountability. Improved land tenure data, related to concessions, farm boundaries, and sourcing information can make environmental impacts clearer to everyone interacting with a supply chain. Meanwhile more frequently-updated data on forest changes (now available annually, or as often as weekly across the tropics), could provide a powerful tool to identify supply chain risk, and monitor compliance with deforestation commitments. Companies must actively monitor the areas where they are sourcing, and make related disclosures; where information proactively disclosed is unavailable, civil society groups and research organizations have filled in the blanks through their own investigations. Non-governmental organizations have been working with companies and governments to develop environmental assessment tools, while certification systems for anti-deforestation requirements have advanced the sustainability agenda. Moratoria on purchasing commodities grown on deforested land have been successful under some conditions, notably in the case of Brazil’s Soy Moratorium in the Amazon, though they have been difficult to extend sector-wide. Approaches that take into account the needs of producers, and are adapted to different geographies and supply chains, are necessary to foster agricultural production that minimizes forest impacts. Regional processes, such as those tied to Tropical Forest Alliance 2020, have showcased the power of collaborative efforts; a regional pledge signed by seven African governments to shift to sustainable palm oil production, called the Marrakesh Declaration, is one such example. Hastening the implementation of jurisdictional programs that have a state or regional focus could further bolster progress towards achieving sustainable development goals. A Tropical Forest Alliance 2020-commissioned study published in early 2017 identified 34 different jurisdictional programmes that were being planned or implemented.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.54"
"4.130","Competition from Institutional Investors","","As institutional investors continue to grow and evolve, they have begun to develop their own in-house investment capabilities. Services that were once performed only by private investors - such as private equity, real estate investments and infrastructure investments to name a few - in an outsourced or advisory capacity are now increasingly being done using internal personnel. Institutional investors are now pursuing several models of direct investing, including  co-investment, where an asset manager allows the institutional investor to invest alongside their investments without an additional asset management fees; partnerships, where an institution may partner with other institutional direct investors or with an asset manager, and partners may make an informal agreement to pursue an asset together; and a solo model, where all investment decisions and strategizing are done within the organization, allowing for the highest degree of asset owner engagement. A major factor in the move toward more direct investing has been dissatisfaction with the prevailing fee structure, usually a variation of the  ‘two and twenty’ model – wherein fund managers charge 2% of assets managed and claim 20% of any profits. With many institutional investors publically accountable to large interest groups it is difficult to justify paying the large fees often demanded by private investors. This has been compounded by the fact that in recent years hedge funds and private equity firms that have handled institutional investor assets have underperformed. According to the 2016 Prequin Global Hedge Fund Report, only around two-thirds of hedge funds posted positive returns, with an average of only 2.02% in 2015, the same year 33% of investors said their performance expectations were not met. These factors have contributed to an increased desire for control in investing decisions by institutional investors, pushing them to be much more aggressive with building out in-house investment teams, which allows them to dictate investment strategies. Competition from institutional investors has caused private investors to adapt their offering to provide their capital providers with more control over investment decisions, and the reduction or elimination of some fees.  New partnership models have also emerged, especially in private equity.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.110"
"4.131","Computational Confrontation","","Technology plays a profound role in shaping the global risks landscape. Massive data fraud and theft, cyber-threats and manipulation, advancements in quantum research, and advanced and pervasive forms of surveillance and ""dataveillance"" are all related factors. This was highlighted in the World Economic Forum’s Regional Risks for Doing Business Report 2018, with cyber-risks consolidating their position as the top risk in regions including Europe, East Asia, and North America. Around two-thirds of the respondents surveyed for the Forum's 2019 Global Risks Perception Survey expected the risks associated with fake news and identity theft to increase, while three-fifths said the same about loss of privacy to companies and governments. Malicious cyber-attacks and lax cybersecurity protocols led to massive breaches of personal information in 2018. The largest was in India, where the government ID database, Aadhaar, suffered multiple breaches that potentially compromised the records of all 1.1 billion registered citizens. Elsewhere, personal data breaches affected around 150 million users of the MyFitnessPal application, an initially estimated 500 million Marriott hotel guests, and around 50 million Facebook users. Cyber vulnerabilities can emerge in unexpected places, as demonstrated in 2018 by the Meltdown and Spectre cyber-threats - which targeted weaknesses in computer hardware, rather than software. These threats potentially affected every Intel processor produced in the last 10 years. A failure to adequately understand and address risks related to technology, like the potentially cascading effects of cyber-attacks or the breakdown of critical information infrastructure such as cryptography, could have far-reaching consequences. In addition, as technology progresses, workers around the world are increasingly likely to see their jobs automated. Robots will move beyond from completing manual tasks in warehouses, to handling projects in industries like tourism and healthcare - affecting so-called knowledge workers, who may have once had engineering or design jobs that were deemed safe from automation. Technology can also create a dividing line that exacerbates inequality. While 94% of young people in developed countries use the internet, according to International Telecommunications Union statistics published in 2017, just 30% of young people in the least developed countries as defined by the United Nations are online. Meanwhile the internet penetration rate among men worldwide is 50.9%, compared with just 44.9% for women, according to the statistics.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.70"
"4.132","Conflict Zones and Fragile States","","The theft of nuclear material dates back at least to 1957, and the pilfering of uranium-235 from a nuclear scrap recycling plant in Pennsylvania at the height of the Cold War, according to the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation. During any period of conflict, there is an increased risk of the theft of nuclear material and weapons. Due to the proliferation of nuclear technology in recent years and heightened global instability, related risks have spread to some of the world’s least stable territories. Reports made to the Nuclear Security Summit held in the US in 2016, for example, noted that conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia, and within Ukraine, have ratcheted up the risk of nuclear material being smuggled across borders. Fragile or breakaway states like Transnistria, between the Dniester River and Ukraine, and South Ossetia (officially a part of Georgia), provide both a safe haven for smugglers and sources of illicit nuclear material; significant amounts of highly enriched uranium have gone unaccounted for in the region since the breakup of the Soviet Union. In 1995, the International Atomic Energy Agency began compiling related information about unauthorized movements of nuclear or other radioactive material, by establishing a dedicated Incident and Trafficking Database. Nuclear reactors have become key targets. According to media reports, an aborted Islamic State attack in Belgium in 2016 was likely meant to target a nuclear power plant, and suspected state-sponsored Russian hackers targeted nuclear facilities in the US in 2017 - as tension mounted over alleged Russian meddling in American elections. Live conflict zones add another layer of danger, as nuclear reactors can become targets of direct attacks. In 2014, Hamas, the Palestinian group that controls Gaza, launched three Iranian-designed rockets that targeted but narrowly missed the Dimona reactor in Israel. Amid renewed exchanges of violence during 2018 between Israel and Iranian proxies in Lebanon and Syria, and civil unrest in Gaza and the West Bank, a repeat attack became increasingly possible. The ongoing conflict in Syria is also a major risk factor, as nuclear material generated by the country’s former nuclear weapons programme is largely unaccounted for. A March 2018 report published by the Institute for Science and International Security suggested that this material may include enriched uranium and related equipment, potentially providing the necessary elements for a so-called dirty bomb.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.102"
"4.133","Conflict and Peacebuilding","","We know very little about the exact role that religion plays in conflict situations, or in peacebuilding efforts. Religion intersects with related economic, social, and political factors in complex ways, and religious communities are often arrayed on opposite sides of the same issue. Still, evidence suggests that religion plays a significant role in both the causes of conflict, and in the path to peace and reconciliation. Religious beliefs and communities have helped to spur people to violence in the past; in many conflicts, religion is a clear identity marker, simultaneously grouping those who affiliate, and differentiating those perceived to be outsiders or “others.” Religious identities used in this way can encourage social cleavage and enclaves, weakening social cohesion by fostering suspicion. The Bosnian War fought among Bosnian (largely Muslim), Serbian (Orthodox) and Croatian (Catholic) forces as part of the breakup of the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s, for example, was not a purely religious conflict, as religious groups had coexisted and intermarried for centuries. However, during those centuries, a cohesive, shared identity did not develop. Rather than genuinely fighting about religion, nationalists in late 20th century Bosnia were therefore instead able to use ethnoreligious identity as a rallying mechanism. Whatever the cause of conflict or the parties involved, it is important to analyse the roles played by religion, and the potential roles it can play in the peace process and in the reconstruction of societies and of social cohesion. In contexts where multiple religious groups or traditions are involved, interreligious engagement can help foster strategies for peace that cut across divisions. Interreligious engagement relies upon each religious tradition involved to represent its own principles and values, while also providing a space to hear and understand the perspective of other traditions. Richer knowledge and social relations is one aim. Interreligious engagement is not easy, and entails risk. Still, related efforts have proliferated at the global and community level. Examples include Pope Francis using a 2014 visit to the al-Aqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem to embrace an imam and a rabbi and call on Christians, Jews, and Muslims to love another, or the Central African Republic Inter-faith Peace-building Partnership, which brought together a consortium of religious representatives to counter instability and violence following a 2013 coup.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.115"
"4.134","Conflict and Security Challenges","","Armed conflict is becoming increasingly complex, and involves an increasing number of actors - while the number of countries becoming embroiled in extreme conflict is rising. According to a report published by the UN Refugee Agency in 2017, more people had been uprooted by war, violence and persecution than at any time during the agency’s seven-decade history; the number of people seeking safety across international borders as refugees topped 22.5 million, the highest number since the agency was founded in the wake of World War II. A rise in violent extremism in many areas of the world, in combination with economic stagnation, food insecurity and disease, have led to greater levels of overall displacement and migration. Statistics from individual conflict zones are staggering. In South Sudan, for example, which was formed as an independent nation in 2011 but suffers from a legacy of decades of civil war, about one out of every four people were displaced as of 2016, according to the UN agency’s report, and 1.4 million people had fled as refugees to neighbouring countries (from a country with a total population of about 12 million, according to the World Bank). Increasingly, non-state actors such as migrant smugglers and brokers, non-governmental organizations, and the media are challenging the influence of states when it comes to responding to migration and displacement. This presents downsides, in the form of increasingly prevalent smuggling networks and other illicit practices, but it can also have positive effects. One is the increased development of apps that help migrants integrate more quickly in locations such as Germany, or help report war crimes (the eyeWitness to Atrocities App, developed by the eyeWitness Project to help human rights investigators and journalists create recordings in war zones that include GPS coordinates, time and location, is a good example), according to the International Organization for Migration’s World Migration Report 2018. Technology innovation in general is better enabling cross-border networking. Global access to mobile phones, for example, has risen to nearly 100 subscriptions for every 100 people, from about 10 subscriptions per 100 people in 2000, according to the World Migration Report 2018. This can enable virtual connectedness for migrants, though physical isolation remains a problem - the report cites a lifelong resident of the Dadaab refugee camp in Kenya describing her sometimes frustrating efforts to stay abreast of global developments, through a temperamental internet connection on her phone.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.98"
"4.135","Conflict, Security and Water","","Whether it is the source of conflict or protest, water is playing an increasingly prominent role in civil unrest - sometimes as a target, and often as a catalyst. Examples include the violent protests in Morocco’s Rif region that followed water shortages there in 2017, and the destruction by militants of an important well in Kenya’s Mandera County (also in 2017), which left hundreds of residents without water. The Indus Waters Treaty, which divides the Indus River tributaries between India and Pakistan, is a prominent example of compromise that has been crafted on the issue of water. However, this type of cooperation is being tested by climate change, population growth, and regional conflict. Dramatic swings in seasonal water supply can threaten stability by affecting agricultural output and spurring migration. The Pacific Institute, a US-based think tank, has long tracked incidents such as attacks on water systems and infrastructure, the use of water as a weapon, and terrorist attacks on water systems; it has noted a recent shift in the nature of these conflicts away from water disputes between nations, and towards sub-national and local violence related to water access. There is a clear link between economic trends, and instances of social instability and unequal access to water. Global income disparities are the widest they have been in a century, and inequality in combination with climate stress is helping to reshape global geopolitics. While the Arab Spring resulted in deposed dictators, fractious politics in the Middle East have spurred mass migration. Amid this shifting socio-economic landscape, water is increasingly a flashpoint or trigger for violent conflict in places like Syria and Yemen. Water was not historically considered a primary driver of global conflict; rather, it was seen as a compounding variable that worsened existing tension. However, as the global climate becomes more erratic, so too does predicting how much freshwater will be available at any given time, and in any given location - placing water in a far more prominent role as a source of discord. Only by better understanding the links between water and the traditional metrics of conflict can we better predict, understand, and react to water-related conflict around the globe.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.134"
"4.136","Connected and Empowered Consumers","","About 41% of the consumer industry companies listed in the S&P 500 have gone bankrupt since 2000, according to a report published by the World Economic Forum and Accenture; many fell victim to fast-moving trends they were unable to master. Emerging technologies and new business models have enabled people to engage with each other, and with the things they buy, in unprecedented ways. As people in many parts of the world receive historic levels of access to goods and services, they are starting to dictate exactly what it is they want. And they are often embedding themselves at every stage of a value chain, as developers, salespeople, and marketers, according to the report from the Forum and Accenture. As their relationships with customers seeking out the best options becomes more interactive, according to the report, companies may have to shift focus from simply maximizing revenue to creating material consumer value. A food company, for example, might move from just selling food items to participating in an entire healthy-eating system that includes nutritional recipes and physical coaching - and potentially creates value for everyone involved. Personalization has become critical for engaging consumers. Every interaction, product, and service may need to be tailored if companies want to cultivate brand loyalty. According to research published by Deloitte, in some consumer categories more than half of customers expressed interest in buying customized products or services; the majority of those customers would be willing to pay more for customization, and would like to be actively involved in the process, according to the research. These trends do not only apply online; people also want brick-and-mortar retailers to deliver differentiated experiences. Eventually, according to a report published by EY in 2016, differentiated interactions, both live and virtual, will be embedded in everything human beings do - whether it’s going out for dinner, riding in a car, or taking a vacation. For companies attempting to sell things, this will have a profound impact on how they create and measure value, according to the report. And while the need for effective consumer protection policies will remain constant regardless of advances in technology, customers will always trust each other more than they trust brands or businesses - their satisfaction is therefore more important for building brands than traditional advertising, according to the EY report.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.57"
"4.137","Connections and Family","","The global knowledge economy is exposed to growing geopolitical risk and rapid technological change - but is also well suited to flexible, dynamic companies. Established multinationals tend to operate by deploying their own physical and human assets. They have become adept at taking advantage of differences in the cost of capital and labour in various parts of the world, and at leveraging their brands and technologies. Emerging multinationals have tended to grow in a different way. Rather than creating wholly-owned subsidiaries, for example, they have sought to use alliances in order to expand internationally. Some of these alliances are geared towards securing access to resources that are not available at home, while others enable access to markets (in particular, access to relatively high-growth, high-risk markets). As a result, these firms from emerging markets have embraced relatively flexible, network forms of organization as they expand overseas. While established multinationals have also moved in this direction, their progress has been much more tentative. Foreign direct investment by multinational enterprises from some emerging markets has risen sharply - investment by enterprises from China, for example, rose 44% in 2016 compared with the prior year, according to a report published by the UN Conference on Trade and Development. A key feature of emerging multinationals is that many tend to be family owned and controlled. According to an estimate published in 2016 by the consultancy BCG, over half of the companies with more than $1 billion in annual revenue in India and Southeast Asia, and nearly half of those in Brazil, were family businesses - compared with 33% in the US. This is in part the result of underdeveloped financial markets in the companies’ countries of origin, which has forced the companies to retain earnings to fund growth (rather than bringing in investors from outside of a founding family). Family ownership and control can bolster long-term planning. A challenge, however, is to ensure that family management does not turn away external talent; as emerging multinationals grow, they often find it impossible to rely only on controlling families to fill their most important positions. Capitalizing on the advantages of family control, while avoiding related pitfalls, could enable these firms to further expand their global clout.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.46"
"4.138","Connectivity and Circular Approaches","","Technology is enabling new approaches to the circular economy, which involves the reuse of materials in order to eliminate waste and benefit the environment. The Internet of Things, for example, which enables the online connectivity of large numbers of devices, can provide remote, continuous monitoring of the use of natural resources (during a harvest, or amid production at a factory) in order to better eliminate waste. The Internet of Things can also enable business models that involve renting or leasing cars or appliances (rather than selling them), and remotely monitoring their condition - thereby potentially eliminating the need to discard and replace old items that stop working due to poor upkeep. The technology can also help governments facilitate circular approaches. Barcelona, for example, has used the Internet of Things to improve energy efficiency through the deployment of smart meters to monitor consumption in targeted parts of the city; Barcelona also uses the technology to monitor waste collection, and optimize collection routes with the use of smart bins. Lampposts in Barcelona also make use of the Internet of Things, by sensing when there are no pedestrians nearby and automatically dimming their lights. For businesses, emerging technologies and increased connectivity have enabled the better tracking and management of materials and assets, which can potentially be looped through additional use cycles. According to a report published by the World Economic Forum and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation in 2015, Intelligent Assets, predictive (or “preventive”) maintenance systems enabled by the Internet of Things can be used by manufacturers to monitor and replace components before they fail and cause wasteful periods of downtime. In terms of logistics, greater internet connectivity can help companies track down products in order to re-use or recycle them. HP, for example, is able to operate its Instant Ink service, launched in 2014, by using remote monitoring, according to the Intelligent Assets report. Subscribers to the service pay a monthly fee based on the number of pages that they print, and when a printer’s ink cartridge runs low, HP is notified automatically to provide a replacement, according to the report - HP can then recycle the resulting haul of empty cartridges.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.31"
"4.139","Connectivity and Coverage","","Electronic communications infrastructure can play a fundamental role in the fourth industrial revolution, by providing connectivity anywhere and anytime with uniform quality regardless of region or socio-economic status. An efficient infrastructure can, for example, address the issue of the digital divide, which separates those able to access computers and the internet and those who must do without. The number of global internet users rose to roughly 3.4 billion by 2016, from about 2 billion in 2010, according to the International Telecommunications Union; still, only about half of the households in the world had internet access as of 2017, according to the ITU. That is despite the fact that over the past 60 years, both wireline and wireless networks have undergone radical evolution. A multitude of technologies have emerged in parallel, helping to connect the world via fibre broadband networks, undersea cables, cellular mobile networks, and satellites. More significantly, advances in chip design and ever-increasing computing power have made mobile devices extremely powerful. There were about 5 billion mobile phone subscribers in the world as of 2017, a figure expected to grow to nearly 5.9 billion by 2025, according to the trade group GSMA. The exponential growth of the cellular mobile market makes wireless connectivity increasingly affordable. New, Long Term Evolution (LTE)-based networks have eliminated some standards issues, while delivering fast speeds for streaming media, and LTE is expected to be embraced across the world. Meanwhile emerging networks for vehicular communication play a critical role in intelligent transportation systems, and have stringent quality requirements compared with LTE networks; from conception to implementation, care should be taken to ensure that vehicular networks are compatible with LTE networks. In sparsely populated, remote and underdeveloped regions, LTE in its current form may not be economically feasible for cellular operators. Users in these areas are currently served through satellite networks, which are inefficient. For maritime communication, however, these satellite networks are the only option. Unmanned aerial vehicle, or drone, networks could provide a viable alternative; the relatively low cost of their development and deployment make them potentially attractive for operators. One related issue to consider is functionality in the event of natural disasters. While current, state-of-the-art disaster response networks are proprietary and ad hoc in nature, drone-based networks could be deployed quickly and efficiently.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.39"
"4.140","Consequences of the Eurocrisis","","Because of the many other headline-grabbing events in Europe of late, from Brexit to refugees, interest in the so-called Eurocrisis - a multi-year debt crisis within the European Union - has diminished to the point that a casual observer might believe it is over. But there are signs that it is not strictly a thing of the past. Most importantly, the euro is still not backed by a common fiscal policy. That means that policy divergence between member states leads to different borrowing costs, complicating the question of who would be lender of last resort. The issue of divergent borrowing costs, and the inability of weaker economies to devalue their currency, are likely to feed anti-euro and anti-EU sentiment. In some ways, the European Parliament elections held in 2019 further emboldened anti-EU sentiment, as nationalists such as Italy’s Matteo Salvini and his League Party enjoyed local victories. On the other hand, pro-Europe, anti-populist parties also scored a string of successes in places like Germany and Slovakia. The 2018 national election in Italy raised serious questions about the fate of the common currency. The Five Star Movement, a populist party and League Party coalition partner that fared well in that national election (but demonstrated a serious decline popularity in 2019 European Parliament elections), has in the past suggested it might hold a popular referendum on Italy’s membership in the eurozone. The departure of one of largest economies in the EU from the euro would create serious economic problems both for Italy and for other members of the currency union. There is no precedent for a country leaving the Eurozone; experts say it would be impossible to do so in an orderly manner. More broadly, the Eurocrisis has revealed and deepened major fault lines. An unhealthy, core-periphery dynamic has developed around Germany, and bad blood exists between member states which considerably weakens solidarity. Deeply unpopular economic adjustment programmes in the countries most affected by recession have fostered ill will. The Eurocrisis is not over yet, and the EU will have to deal with its consequences for years to come.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.50"
"4.141","Conservation, Restoration and Regeneration","","About 82% of all mammal biomass has been lost since prehistory, while the average abundance of native species in most major land-based habitats has fallen by at least one-fifth (mostly since 1900). In addition, more than one-third of all marine mammals are now threatened, according to the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. The IPBES now estimates that in total, roughly one million animal and plant species are threatened with extinction - the most in human history. While nature is under severe threat, conservation, restoration, and regeneration present potential solutions. The restoration of degraded landscapes can improve ecological integrity and human well-being. In Switzerland, for example, restoration has increased the capacity of that country’s forests, rivers, and lakes to provide water purification services; other examples include Ethiopia’s effort to plant more than 350 million trees in a single day in 2019, and the $1 billion invested in areas of the Catskills Mountains that provide water for New York City. Unlike restoration, regeneration allows landscapes to recover their richness and functionality without active intervention. Regardless of their differences, both restoration and regeneration require comprehensive planning in order to be effective; non-native species should not be introduced via planting, and isolated areas of protected habitat cannot maintain viable populations unless surrounding areas are also made hospitable to wildlife that might cross over to find food or mates. This type of responsible planning can be achieved by establishing networks of wildlife corridors within areas dedicated to different land uses - like crops or livestock. Restoration efforts often require costly initial investments, but are cost-effective when considering the long-term benefits to society; studies show that the natural regeneration of tropical lowland pastures can help store large additional amounts of carbon, for example. In addition, costs can often be reduced by allowing landscapes to regenerate naturally. While the cost-benefit ratio of restoring ecosystems is usually positive, in order to maximize related benefits both restoration and regeneration need to have well-defined goals. While some projects aim to return landscapes to pre-disturbance conditions - by establishing a baseline before a system was degraded, damaged, or destroyed - this is not always possible.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.21"
"4.142","Consumer Trust and Transparency","","Large emerging markets like India and China, where an expanding middle class is expected to buoy the global economy with growing consumer spending in the coming years, are home to notable lags in public trust among the “mass population” in businesses and government, according to the 2019 Edelman Trust Barometer - a survey of 33,000 respondents conducted in more than two dozen markets. According to the barometer, more than two-thirds of respondents agreed that they might be encouraged to buy products from a company with a good reputation - but unless they genuinely came to trust the company behind the product, they would stop buying it. As global consumers become more connected and empowered thanks to digital innovation, they will only place more scrutiny on businesses. For corporate leaders, this means having to strike the right balance between short-term gains and long-term value creation. According to the Edelman Trust Barometer, one means of winning external trust is by investing internally in employees; 78% of barometer respondents agreed with the idea that the way a company treats its employees is one of the best indicators of its level of trustworthiness. People have fundamental concerns about the safety and quality of the goods they consume. In China, for example, worries about food and medicine safety have become significant (particularly among wealthier consumers) in recent years, according to a report published by the World Economic Forum in 2018. In addition, these affluent, urban-dwelling consumers in China have particular concerns related to the historical role of fake products in the country, according to the report. Another growing area of consumer concern is related to transparency in supply chains - whether it’s tied to sustainable sourcing or ethical labour standards. In the apparel sector, efforts have been made by the Sustainable Apparel Coalition and Better Work, a collaboration between the UN’s International Labour Organization and the International Finance Corporation, to improve working conditions and sustainability by, for example, introducing standards to measure social and environmental impact. Data privacy is also a serious consumer concern. A relatively small group of companies including Facebook and Amazon (or, in China, Alibaba and JD.com) control large amounts of consumer data - which will present trust issues, as new means of refining and selling that data emerge.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.57"
"4.143","Consumer Well-Being","","Countries with expanding economies are home to an increasing consumer desire to prioritize health and wellness. In China, for example, where average annual household disposable income had reached the equivalent of about $3,000 ($7,000 within Beijing) by 2015, according to Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data, health was the top local concern cited in a 2018 consumer report published by Nielsen. Personal care products enjoyed the highest sales growth of any Chinese segment in the second quarter of 2018, according to the Nielsen report, by tapping into health and beauty trends. Other countries in the region where health has become the top consumer concern include Viet Nam and Japan, according to the report. Beyond traditional physical health concerns related to issues like high blood pressure and diabetes, these countries are also increasingly focused on the impact of pollution, ageing, sleep deficiency, and stress. Meanwhile increases in obesity and non-communicable diseases like diabetes, due to a lack of access to healthy food and unhealthy lifestyle choices, is a challenge both in Asia and elsewhere (non-communicable diseases account for 63% of all deaths globally, according to the World Health Organization). It can be a challenge to create and then amplify consumer awareness about what a healthy lifestyle entails, and the healthy choices that can be made. For example, cardiovascular disease like heart ailments and diabetes can only be more effectively prevented by spurring more conscious consumer engagement with food and nutrition choices - or more active pursuit of improved physical fitness (by, for example, taking yoga classes and purchasing related clothing and gear) and better mental health (potentially by using sleep and meditation apps). Retailers can help bolster this awareness by offering more health-related services; one example is Wal Mart’s decision in 2017 to start offering health testing from Quest Diagnostics at some of its stores in the US. The combination of e-commerce, technology, healthcare, and finance has the potential to create transformational products that improve health and well-being, through the monitoring and measuring of objectives via wearable fitness devices and apps - though this poses related risks tied to consumer data privacy, making trust and transparency critical.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.57"
"4.144","Consumerization of Mental Health","","People everywhere are suffering in silence from depression, addiction, and other mental illnesses due to a fear of social stigma - or because they are simply unable to obtain care. Even in a relatively wealthy nation like the US, millions of people live in areas that suffer from severe shortages of mental health providers. The economic burden is significant; according to a study published by scholars from Pennsylvania State University and Texas A&M University at Galveston in 2018, the global cost of mental illness is expected to exceed $16 trillion over the next 20 years, with more than half of that cost to be incurred in high-income countries. In the US alone, according to the study, which was published in The Review of Regional Studies, the annual cost of poor mental health is as much as $62 billion - similar to the amount of productivity loss incurred due to failing transportation infrastructure - while for those employed in the US poor mental health can reduce their individual annual income by as much as $6,000. Digital platforms that combine technology and a human touch could provide a means for patients to receive the care they need, by helping to grant them a transparent view of pricing options and the quality of care providers, according to a report published by the World Economic Forum’s Global Agenda Council on Mental Health in 2016. Studies have shown that the more engaged patients are, the more they can lower their costs by eliminating unnecessary procedures or readmissions. Digital tools can help patients manage their own behaviour; mobile phone-based mental health apps can provide continuous, convenient access to help, and some have been developed in the form of games. This gamification can more intuitively engage patients, and potentially create better odds that beneficial behaviour will become self-sustaining (while the promise of gamified interventions is significant, to date there is relatively little clinical-quality evidence to support their use). Apps designed to address mental health needs that are currently available include What’s Up, a tool for tracking habits in the interest of helping cope with depression, anxiety, or stress, and Mind Shift, which is designed to help teens deal with anxiety.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.95"
"4.145","Continuous Monitoring","","At a 2010 roundtable on evidence-based medicine, Harvard University’s Dr. Ashish Jha presented evidence showing that in the US, there are billions of dollars in avoidable healthcare costs every year due to the unnecessary escalation of treatment and the recurrence of disease. More coordinated care could help alleviate this problem. According to a report published in 2016 by the World Economic Forum’s Global Agenda Council on Mental Health, remote wearable sensors - including fitness trackers, smartphones, and smart skin patches used to monitor body chemistry - could help to improve health by enabling patients to more easily collect behavioural information. That collected data can in turn be transmitted to doctors, allowing for better monitoring of patient condition and treatment compliance, and even potentially increasing access to care in remote locations. In addition, because people with serious mental illnesses (including schizophrenia and mood disorders) are less physically active than the general population, the ability of wearable devices and smartphone apps to promote more active lifestyles is particularly valuable, according to an article published in the journal Mental Health and Physical Activity in 2016. When it comes to a doctor’s treatment of mental and neurological disorders, patient states often fluctuate significantly over time - though doctors are only able to assess their condition based on a snapshot view during an office visit. In addition, access to any care can be difficult to obtain; in the US, for example, nearly half of the 60 million adults in the country living with mental health conditions go without any treatment, due to factors including high rates of denials of care by insurers and high out-of-pocket costs, according to a report published in 2017 by the National Alliance on Mental Illness. More reliable and continuous monitoring by a doctor could help provide a more complete and accurate picture of a patient’s health, improve the effectiveness of care, or even help anticipate when care will be needed. Meanwhile remote sensors could help contribute to the gathering of more accurate patient data - which is often self-reported, and can therefore be incomplete or biased. Before this can become a reality, however, sensor developers must ensure that devices can deliver clinical-grade data that can be meaningfully and safely used in medical decision-making.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.95"
"4.146","Corporate Governance","","Bolivia’s performance in this area of the Index shows the greatest room for improvement in terms of conflict of interest regulation, where it has a progress score (ranging from a poor mark of zero to a top mark of one hundred) of 40.00, resulting in a rank of 121st out of 140 countries; and in terms of shareholder governance where it has a progress score of 40.00 that results in a rank of 106th out of 140 countries.

"4.147","Corporate Governance 4.0","","Governance needs to be optimized, rather than minimized. The four arms of governance at a family business - the owners, controlling family members, the board, and non-family executives - have to step up, as regulation piles up in response to scandals and political pressure. While there is considerable discussion about the technologies shaping the Fourth Industrial Revolution, such as artificial intelligence and robotics, there is less attention paid to the specific impact of new innovation on governance. A family business that aims to be tech-savvy and lean will struggle with an antiquated board; we therefore need to move to Corporate Governance 4.0, in order to enhance communication, better define roles, and ensure agility. Governance should provide vision and a sense of responsibility, and ensure accountability. And, in a world where compliance reports run to hundreds of pages, specific roles must be clearly defined. Family business owners and boards have to strike a balance, by understanding the business without being drawn into day-to-day management. Owners must establish a vision and standards, while giving clear direction on speed, growth strategy, ethics, and risk appetite. With Corporate Governance 4.0, and enhanced clarity on roles, overlap between different management and oversight structures can be kept to a minimum. Communication among all levels, cohesion around a shared vision and values, and direction can all be centred on the leanest viable structure - augmented by digital systems that present data on everything from unit profitability to staff turnover. While sadly rare in practice, this sort of super-intelligent dashboard providing sophisticated information in real time is possible with existing technology. Such a tool could be liberating for boards, as around half of all board meetings are currently consumed with analyzing financial and other statements. In this way, technology can free up human intelligence to focus on what it is best at: strategic judgement, establishing and maintaining values, and setting direction. Many family businesses fail to adapt effectively when faced with unpredictability and change, especially during a time of increasing regulation. Those best able adapt will do so thanks to a willingness to adopt technology and to clearly articulate the roles set by their governing bodies. This key issue is curated in partnership with Denise Kenyon-Rouvinez, the Wild Group Professor and Director of the IMD Global Family Business Center at IMD International.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.51"
"4.148","Corporate Intrapreneurship","","Despite their market dominance and huge financial resources, many large corporations have been disrupted, and have lost out on growth opportunities, due to their inability to match the speed of execution of startups. Often, these large firms lose out due to an unwillingness to embrace innovation that risks cannibalizing their existing products and services. In addition, many of these large organizations are losing top talent, who move on to start their own entrepreneurial ventures or join fast-growing startups. In recent years, an increasing number of large corporations are trying to fight back, by re-examining their organizational design and business models in the hope of co-opting startups’ best practices. In practice, this means enabling entrepreneurial developments, and fostering a faster pace of internal innovation. Various models for “intrapreneurship” have emerged, including open innovation labs, corporate-sponsored hackathons, corporate accelerator programs for startups and designating resident entrepreneurs.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.47"
"4.149","Corporate Risk Management","","Every organization is confronted with some type of risk - operational, financial, technological, environmental, regulatory - which can have devastating consequences. Effective corporate governance requires continuous and systematic management of all types of risk, both current and anticipated. First, risks must be prioritized, and here the board of directors can play a key role by deciding in what priority they should be addressed, what is to be deemed simply unacceptable, and how they should be addressed from a structural perspective. For example, evidence gathered from the 2007 global financial meltdown indicates that banks with boards that had identified a need to establish a separate risk management committee managed the crisis better than those with integrated committees. The benefits of this type of separation have become only more evident as fiduciary duties have come to include oversight of a broad range of matters, including compliance with international accounting rules and stability measures that require banks to set aside capital in case of potential losses. Implementing a robust risk management system requires the integration of different parts of an organization, including the board’s risk committee, internal auditing, finance, legal, and operations. Increasingly complex and rapidly changing economic, environmental, social, and technological conditions have multiplied potential risk scenarios. Worsening climate change, geopolitical tensions, trade wars, and social upheaval like the protests that spread in Hong Kong in 2019 require corporate governance that is proactive when it comes to identifying risks and addressing them. Determining an appropriate board structure and approach to risk management will depend upon both a company’s industry and stage of its life cycle; risk exposure is very different for financial institutions than it is for petrochemical firms. Even within the financial sector, different approaches are required - from insurers exposed to extreme weather events related to climate change, to retail banks making loans to small businesses during volatile periods. Organizations are dealing with complexity and litigiousness like never before, forcing their boards to assess current and past organizational exposure. Still, there are some strategic advantages to taking risks; after all, achieving sustained growth requires some degree of risk-taking. Incorporating risk management into corporate strategy is therefore crucial.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.36"
"4.150","Corporate Social Innovation","","Society faces major challenges, including a lack of access to education and healthcare, income inequality, widespread unemployment, and environmental problems like climate change and ocean pollution. Experience shows that solutions cannot be found solely in government policies, and instead require collaboration with businesses - which have the power to create and distribute across borders in order to have real impact. Business leaders no longer focus solely on financial results; they increasingly face expectations from shareholders, customers, the media, their employees, and others to consider the broader impact they are having on society and the environment, and whether or not they are creating meaningful jobs. Corporate engagement has evolved from philanthropy, to corporate social responsibility, to social innovation. Unlike more traditional initiatives, corporate social innovation is embedded in corporate strategy, R&D, employee development, and partnerships. Rather than one-off projects, the focus is on sustainable social change, and developing long-term strategies to address social problems. It is a strategic direction, rather than an isolated initiative. And, instead of a top-down approach, it relies on a participatory, collaborative model that takes into account feedback from customers and employees.   Examples of corporate social innovation include Unilever’s Sustainable Living Plan, which is designed to double the size of the consumer goods company’s business over ten years while at the same time reducing its environmental impact; the company’s Sustainable Living-branded products have actually seen sales increase 50% faster than the rest of its products. Meanwhile General Electric’s (through GE Healthcare) “Healthymagination” program develops affordable products designed to address global health issues - in one case, the program worked with a social enterprise to develop and distribute low-cost incubators that address India’s high infant mortality rate. Other examples: IBM established “Corporate Service Corp,” a volunteer initiative that sends 500 young leaders a year on team assignments in more than 30 developing countries; and Danone’s Nutriplanet group analyses socioeconomic and cultural data in order to better understand health issues in developing countries. The Danone group reformulated a best-selling cheese in Brazil, for example, to improve health outcomes by reducing sugar and adding vitamins. The group also developed a nutrient-rich yogurt targeted at children in Bangladesh. As more demands are made of companies for greater transparency, accountability, and impact measurement, these types of initiatives will become increasingly common.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.118"
"4.151","Corruption and Impunity","","Organized crime and illicit economies are increasingly prominent sources of political corruption, as criminal networks pour money into parties and forge alliances with officials and their intermediaries. Transnational organized crime generates an estimated $870 billion in annual revenue, and about one third of organized crime groups surveyed by the United Nations have political influence at the local level, according to a report published in 2016 by the Global Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime. Transactional corruption of law enforcement and public officials diverts resources from the state, and increasingly, in countries with poor institutions, the receipt of a bribe is perceived as a right of office - while payment of a bribe is seen as a cost of doing business. This has generated distrust in politicians, distorted markets, undermined public infrastructure, and disengaged citizens. During the 2014 regional elections in Peru, for example, the Ministry of the Interior announced that 124 candidates had links to drug traffickers - yet, 14% of those candidates were ultimately elected, according to the Global Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime’s 2016 report. Crime and corruption are further facilitated by the decline of stigma associated with illegal acts; illicit activity is regularly used to gain political power, or to buy legitimacy with the public. A lack of law enforcement, penalties, or any deterring government presence at all runs the risk of increasing complicity over time. In Afghanistan, for example, the lack of a state presence is thought to be the most important contributing factor to the rampant opium production in the southwestern provinces of Helmand, Kandahar, Nimruz, and Farah, according to the Global Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime’s report. In many areas of Afghanistan, the Taliban has taken advantage of the lack of state security to become the security provider itself, and its drug-related income - from both smuggling and protecting fields from police scrutiny - has been estimated to be as much as $155 million annually, according to the report. The high-level business and government officials who enable criminal behaviour through neglect or complicity are exacting heavy cost on the rest of us; the annual cost of corruption in the form of bribery and theft amounts to about $3.6 trillion, according to a UN estimate published in 2018.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.75"
"4.152","Corruption and Infrastructure","","Corruption continues to be a significant barrier to efforts to close a global infrastructure investment gap that is expected to reach $435 billion a year by 2040 in terms of road transportation, and $164 billion a year in terms of energy systems, according to the Global Infrastructure Hub. According to research published in the journal Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice in 2018, between 2009 and 2014 corruption inflated the price of infrastructure projects by an average of between 30% and 35% in high-corruption-risk regions of Europe. According to a report published by the U4 Anti-Corruption Resource Centre, the amount of construction costs lost to bribe payments varies between 5% and 20% (or even higher) globally. While the high cost of corruption makes it difficult for infrastructure to be developed in new markets, initiatives aimed at addressing this issue are being developed. For example, the World Economic Forum’s Partnering Against Corruption Initiative (PACI) works with business leaders, other international organizations, and governments to address corruption, transparency, and emerging-market risks. One example of PACI’s work in the field is the “Building Foundations of Trust and Integrity” project, which examined how developing trust for public-private cooperation could help address corruption in Latin America - using Mexico as a case study. The project convened workshops and meetings in Mexico and engaged with international business leaders, and made recommendations including the development of a digital tool for sharing corruption-related news and data. A multi-stakeholder approach is needed in order to tackle corruption, and significantly bring down the cost of infrastructure projects by enabling developers to more efficiently allocate capital and deliver services quickly, safely, and cheaply. For countries like Mexico, a great deal is at stake; according to a PACI report published in 2017 detailing the “Building Foundations of Trust and Integrity” project, when corruption takes resources from the public purse, basic services are not provided for the general population and instead are funnelled to corrupt officials and businesses. According to the report, once a system is corrupted in this way it perpetuates inequality, leading to decreased trust and even more corruption in a vicious cycle.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.79"
"4.153","Crime and the Environment","","Environmental crime is an increasingly rewarding activity; in the past decade it has escalated in terms of variety, volume, and value. Land grabbing, illegal logging and mining, and accessing restricted water sources all have serious consequences for human rights, economic growth, and social development. Even so-called “petty” corruption can lead to disastrous consequences for natural resource use - for example, according to a report published by the Water Integrity Network in 2016, the Nairobi City Water and Sewage Company in Kenya was losing 40% of its supply to theft and leaks, while poor residents were being forced to buy water privately that was as much as 25 times more expensive. Illegal land grabbing can meanwhile lead to forced displacement and other serious consequences. Oxfam estimates an area of land equivalent in size to Portugal has been sold off to foreign investors over the past decade, with some of those deals involving land grabs. However, Oxfam has noted some positive recent commitments from the private sector, including pledges from Coca Cola, PepsiCo, and Nestle to respect the land rights of indigenous communities and eliminate land grabs from their supply chains. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime noted in a 2017 report that efforts by the international community to curb the illegal wildlife trade seemed to be having a positive effect - it recorded a decline in the number of rhinos poached in South Africa, and elephant poaching levels that were significantly lower than their peak in 2011. However, concerns raised in the report included a high volume of seizures of scales culled from African pangolins; while legal trade in the small mammals has virtually disappeared, the equivalent of 200,000 live pangolins were seized illegally between 1999 and 2016, and 2017 was on pace to mark a new high, according to the report (in early 2019, officials in Hong Kong recorded their biggest-ever seizure of pangolin scales, weighing in at 8.2 tonnes). The biodiversity of a number of critical ecosystems is at risk. Illegal fishing is one of the most neglected areas of environmental crime; illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing costs the global economy as much as $23.5 billion annually, according to data cited in report published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 2018. Illegal trade in natural resources can also exacerbate income inequality, and fund organized crime.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.75"
"4.154","Crisis of Representation","","Like many other European countries, France has witnessed a surge of populism. During the first round of the 2017 presidential election, left-wing candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon and his party La France Insoumise (France Unbowed) won 20% of the vote, while the extreme right candidate Marine Le Pen and her Front National (National Front) won 21%. This reflected a shift of voter interest away from traditional parties, which saw the socialist candidate Benoît Hamon and the conservative François Fillon eliminated. France’s traditional political establishment was shaken to its core. More broadly, the country is suffering from a decline of trust in its institutions. According to the Fondation pour l’innovation politique (Fondapol), 89% of French citizens do not trust political parties (compared with 82% in Europe), and 71% do not trust the government (versus 65% in Europe). Meanwhile the quality of public debate is suffering from similarly low levels of public trust in the news media. A 2017 survey conducted by Kantar Public found that just 44% of French citizens think newspapers are a reliable source of information, compared with 51% in the previous year; 41% saw television as a reliable source of information, a nine-percentage-point-decrease from the prior year. One quarter of French citizens now use the internet as a primary source of information, compared with 20% a year earlier, though only 26% actually trust it, according to the survey. According to a study conducted by the research firm Ipsos, 29% of those between 18 and 24 years old in France, and 28% of those between 25 and 35, did not show up to vote during the presidential primaries in 2017 (just 16% of those between 60 and 69 did not vote). In addition, a majority of young voters selected extremist candidates; 21% of those between 18 and 24 voted for Le Pen, and 30% voted for Mélenchon. Several efforts have been made to reinforce the relationship between French citizens and their representatives, though the results are unclear. For example, Emmanuel Macron’s centrist political party La République En Marche (“Republic on the Move”) has brought forward a large number of representatives to the National Assembly who have civil society backgrounds, and have never held elected office before. However, Macron’s administration has nonetheless been faced with a debilitating series of protests by a popular movement known as the “yellow vests,” which has opposed his economic reform agenda as being too favourable to France’s business elite.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.56"
"4.155","Critical Infrastructure Protection","","The need to protect the cyber integrity of critical infrastructure like energy grids and sanitation systems is one of society’s paramount challenges. The proliferation of systems that fuse the cyber and physical worlds by blending physical infrastructure with computing power may increase functionality, but it also creates more targets for cyberattacks. These systems will play a greater role in facilitating healthcare, financial services, and transportation, and security and privacy protection must be a part of their design - not simply addressed after the fact. An attack on even just one critical infrastructure sector, be it energy-related, the financial system, communications networks, or water services, could leave communities or even entire nations crippled. In 2016 alone, the US Department of Homeland Security Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team responded to 290 incidents, including 63 in the critical manufacturing sector, and 59 in the energy sector, according to a published report; more than one quarter of the incidents related to so-called spear phishing attacks, which involve sending fraudulent email in order to entice someone into disclosing confidential information. There has been massive digitalization of the formerly analog functions that underpin critical infrastructure. This is not just confined to power and sewage treatment plants, but has actually spread across many widely-used services. Estonian citizens can now vote online, and Turkish citizens can access their government social assistance via the internet, while oil refinery operators in many locations monitor real time flows and pressure levels on a desktop computer in an office, and nuclear power plant managers track the temperature of cooling towers and the transmission of power in a browser. Critical digital infrastructure will only expand further as public safety, transportation, banking and other services inevitably connect up in order to function more efficiently. Demands to better protect this infrastructure will grow, as threats escalate. A survey of expert members of the European Cybersecurity Forum published by the Kosciuszko Institute in early 2018 projected that the year would be one of increased cyberattacks on critical infrastructure - which may challenge fundamental values that underlie the internet, such as openness and freedom. Only those cyber-physical systems that incorporate privacy and security concerns at the design stage, as fundamental features, will be able to provide a foundation upon which smart public and private services can operate for the greater good.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.38"
"4.156","Cross-Domain Skills","","Aircraft design and manufacturing processes are becoming increasingly complex, particularly when it comes to unmanned aerial vehicles and space technologies. Aerospace engineering education should reflect this change, and a stronger emphasis should be placed on developing interdisciplinary skillsets related to materials and robotics - for both the next generation of aerospace engineers, and for existing workers. This is particularly true in the case of manufacturing, where additive manufacturing (also referred to as 3D printing) has taken centre stage in recent years and has challenged conventional manufacturing norms. Amid budget constraints and increased competition, the aerospace sector will have to achieve more with less. Its rapidly changing job market, in light of increasing digitalization, may lead to severe skills gaps in high-end manufacturing. Due to the constantly evolving, cutting-edge design and manufacturing techniques prevalent in this sector, attracting a sufficient number of university students to pursue STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) programmes relevant to aerospace engineering will require transforming traditional classroom teaching. Placing a heavier emphasis on hands-on approaches, tied to the use of virtual and augmented reality tools, could help in this regard. Spotting the right talent, and investing in it, could help manufacturers avoid skills shortages. Another strategy could involve investing in re-skilling programmes, in partnership with public institutions.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.5"
"4.157","Cultivating Trust","","Trust is crucial for the long-term success of companies - especially at the board level. Genuine trust is underpinned by personal integrity, and by putting the interests of the organization above those of individuals. Boards need to be able to trust that management will bring full transparency into the boardroom - and that will only happen thanks to shared integrity. There is a strong sense of pessimism about leadership in both the private and public sectors. Anxiety related to job security is high, caused by a general lack of training and increasing automation, and that is fuelling the growth of nationalist and protectionist movements. According to the results of a Pew Research Center survey conducted in late 2018, 56% of Americans expressed a lack of confidence in business leaders, while 63% expressed a similar lack of confidence in elected officials. In addition to the general public, employees increasingly expect their employers to do the right thing and take action on social and environmental issues related to inequality, the environment, and climate change. As people lose faith in their political leaders, it appears that they have higher expectations for CEOs. According to the 2019 Edelman Trust Barometer, more than three-quarters of the general population, or 76%, want CEOs to take the lead on necessary social and economic change rather than waiting for governments to act. While organizations must comply with legislation and regulation on everything from taxes to consumer protection, competition, corruption, and environmental protection, they can also be positively influenced in terms of corporate governance and trust by industry self-regulation and voluntary practices - such as a code of conduct. Most cases of fraud and breach of trust among stakeholders can be traced to corporate governance failures, and so corporate leaders have the ultimate responsibility for creating an organizational culture that supports trust - and ensures that management and employees embody and act on the stated values and mission of their organization. Particular areas of increased social expectations that require the attention of boards of directors include diversity (including gender diversity), transparency, equal opportunity, and eliminating all forms of harassment.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.36"
"4.158","Cultural and Creative Industries","","The cultural and creative industries include a vast set of interrelated forces that generate more than $2.25 trillion in revenue annually - a figure larger in size than the individual economies of Brazil, Canada or Italy - and employ nearly 30 million people worldwide, according to Cultural Times, a report published by UNESCO, the International Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers, and the consultancy EY in 2015. Those figures do not include the rampant pirating and unauthorized sale of things like books and recorded music. Creative industries including advertising, architecture, fashion, publishing, and software development all require a strong audience connection, in order to remain relevant and profitable - in every part of the world. The Asia Pacific region accounted for the largest portion of the creative and cultural revenue and jobs cited in the Cultural Times report, at $743 billion in revenue (or 3% of regional GDP) and 12.7 million jobs, while Europe was second in both metrics, followed by North America.  The creative class often drives urban development and innovation, while serving as an important employer. According to the Cultural Times report, cultural and creative industries in Europe tend to employ a greater percentage of young people between the ages of 15 and 29 than any other sector, for example. Governments are increasingly recognizing the importance of the cultural and creative economy as a generator of jobs, wealth and public engagement. South Korea, for example, rolled out an extensive effort to support its creative economy in 2013 by fostering innovation in manufacturing and boosting the use of the internet and digital technology. Meanwhile South Korean pop culture, including K-pop musical groups, has become a significant export. South Korea was placed in elite company, alongside countries including the US, Japan, the United Kingdom, and France in terms of global entertainment and media revenue projected for 2021, according to the consultancy PwC’s Global Entertainment and Media Outlook 2017-2021. In every country, the creative and cultural industries can bring a sense of meaning to both creators and audiences. Yet, there are relatively few viable models available for sustaining creative economies. While the digital transformation of creative industries began long ago, we are still struggling to come up with ways for creators to earn an adequate living. Finding private sector champions to tackle this issue will be crucial. This key issue was curated in partnership with Michael Mason, Director of the Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage, and Sabrina Motley, Director of the Smithsonian Folklife Festival.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.13"
"4.159","Cyber Disruption","","Government-sponsored hacking into the commercial and research concerns of rival nations, as a way of furthering economic or business interests, has become increasingly prevalent; several high profile cases have been made public in recent years, where the aim has been to steal intellectual property and trade secrets for the benefit of domestic firms, or to simply create disruption and chaos. In March 2018, the US government announced criminal charges and sanctions for nine Iranian hackers and an Iranian company accused of working on behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps when they allegedly broke into the computer systems of dozens of American companies, government agencies, and hundreds of universities in the US and elsewhere in order to steal academic data and intellectual property. The US also imposed sanctions on Russian individuals and companies in 2018, for allegedly working with the Russian military to direct cyberattacks at the US’s power grid, nuclear facilities, internet networks, and factories, and allegedly interfering with the 2016 US presidential election. Russia has said the US had no grounds for the sanctions, and has denied interfering in the election. In a sign of just how seriously financial regulators are taking the threat of cyberattacks, the New York Department of Financial Services, the powerful state regulator that oversees the many banks operating in the City of New York, has required the biggest financial institutions under its purview to maintain a cybersecurity program since 2017. A list of significant cyber incidents compiled by the Center for Strategic & International Studies, a US-based think tank, includes reports of a North Korean hacking group allegedly targeting several major Turkish banks and finance agencies, and the SWIFT global payment messaging system, during 2018. Other incidents on the list include a report from cyber security researchers in April 2018 that Chinese state-sponsored hacking groups had allegedly targeted Japanese defence companies in a bid to gain information about the Japanese government’s policies towards North Korea, and a disclosure in December 2017 that French company Schneider Electric was forced to shut down a power plant located in the Middle East after it was hit with a malware attack that had apparently been sponsored by a nation-state.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.64"
"4.160","Cyber Privacy","","The number of payments made by card on the internet is expected to more than double worldwide between 2016 and 2022 (reaching 70 billion), according to research firm RBR. As the use of the internet, smart appliances, sophisticated mobile computing, and biometric data has increased, so have concerns about privacy and security. Calls to abridge privacy in the name of better security must be countered with solutions that strengthen both - and still manage to create a climate conducive to economic growth. Rules for data sharing, for example, must be transparent, incentivize all parties to adhere to them, and ensure privacy protection. The most pressing related challenges revolve around the transmission of personal data. Data collection has become a consistent part of everyday life, and a part of every electronic transaction. European regulators, for example, are seeking to address related issues with the General Data Protection Regulation, being implemented in 2018. That and other legal efforts come as people are not only paying more by card on websites, they are also increasingly paying through their mobile device - a machine loaded with personal information. According to the research firm eMarketer, in 2018 the percentage of all smartphone users aged 14 or older who are making a proximity mobile payment, where payment with a phone is made at an in-store terminal, will reach nearly 35%. Currently, there is often a trade-off between the privacy afforded to individuals and the related information made available to researchers. However, simply removing personal attributes from a data set, for example, does not adequately protect privacy. In 2015, researchers from MIT, Rutgers, and Aarhus University in Denmark published a study in Science that used a set of financial data related to more than one million people, to show that simply using four pieces of anonymized data was enough to identify 90% of the individuals in the set. With data theft becoming increasingly common (notable recent cases include the theft of user information from Yahoo, and from the credit reporting agency Equifax), more must be done to protect individual privacy. In the age of big data, methods of quantifiably reducing the risk of re-identification must be developed, and agreed upon at both the commercial and government levels.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.38"
"4.161","Cyber Resilience","","Cyber resilience, or shielding critical systems from hackers or internal failures, is an increasingly important strategic goal in a world of fast, cheap technologies that deliver both unprecedented benefits and risks.  A common denominator for any proper resilience approach is a deep understanding of the risks associated with particular business models. This means that companies must go beyond traditional information-technology planning and make risk evaluation a regular part of their strategy – particularly as they integrate emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence or quantum computing.  Because of the global scope of modern, private sector IT networks, their digital security is a public good. The public sector has its own responsibility to ensure that its institutions also incorporate digital resilience. That’s because the risk of the misappropriation of digital public infrastructure, like smart electrical grids or communications devices embedded in roads, will only increase over time. Governments and private actors must work together, to develop new ways to sufficiently protect their digital domains.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.78"
"4.162","Cyber Threats","","In 2017, multiple nuclear power plants and water and electric systems in the US were targeted in a series of menacing cyberattacks, according to a leaked US Homeland Security Department report; in March 2018, the US government identified Russia as the source of these cyber messages, which implied the potential for future attacks sophisticated enough to take nuclear reactors offline. The most prominent example of a cyberattack directed at a nuclear facility might be the 2010 “Stuxnet” attack that targeted an Iranian nuclear enrichment facility, which was widely attributed to the US and Israel. The attack featured what has been dubbed the world’s first digital weapon, which used computers at contractors to the facility as a gateway for a malicious worm that caused spinning centrifuges to fail. Nuclear facilities make use of digital, computer-based systems that are linked to key safety and emergency preparedness functions - which therefore require sophisticated cybersecurity programmes, in order to protect critical assets from sabotage. The motives behind cyberattacks are often unclear and their source can be difficult to determine beyond a reasonable doubt. This makes decision-making around retaliation fraught with difficulty, and presents the potential for unintended escalation, and even military confrontation. Analysts have pointed to the so-called signalling aspect of many cyberattacks; that is, their use in at least demonstrating to an adversary that in the event of a military conflict, that adversary’s critical infrastructure could be disabled. In this way, cyberattacks may increasingly be used as a form of deterrence - by holding key infrastructure hostage, an assailant could gain a tactical advantage and deter aggression. In the absence of established international rules governing the deployment of cyberattacks by nation states, their use will likely become increasingly unpredictable, posing a growing risk to nuclear facilities and to international security more broadly. This may spur governments and private actors to invest more heavily in cybersecurity, and to develop the capability to retaliate proportionately in order to effectively deter attacks (private firms are currently prohibited from retaliating against cyber attackers, though the US Congress has considered legislation that could make such retaliation permissible in a limited fashion).","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.102"
"4.163","Cyber War","","While the internet began as military technology, cyber warfare is actually a relatively new concept - with which few people have any experience. Cyberspace has become a fifth dimension of warfare, in addition to land, sea, air, and space; countries should therefore prepare accordingly, by establishing standard procedures for defending against, and recovering from, related attacks. Small-scale cyber warfare is already occurring on a daily basis. The American and British governments, for example, issued statements in early 2018 blaming the Russian government for the “NotPetya” cyber-attack, which they said was intended to de-stabilize Ukraine. And, the United Kingdom has disclosed that it used its cyber capabilities as part of a military campaign to disrupt the online propaganda efforts of the Islamic State in 2017. By using so-called white hat hacking teams to test system security, countries can more proactively fortify; they should also carefully monitor the human element of their security, which can be exploited through social engineering. Most cyberattacks take advantage of human error by using tools such as phishing emails, according to a report published in 2018 by security firm Proofpoint. Countries are vulnerable to attacks that target strategic assets and infrastructure, and disrupt internet traffic, as a means to create unrest. These threats are exacerbated by a lack of international agreements that govern cyber war, and establish rules for digital combat. As a result, the targets of nation-sponsored cyberattacks are not limited to the agencies of counterpart governments, and instead include private entities, like electric utilities - which are often not adequately equipped. In February 2018, United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres called for the establishment of global rules governing cyber warfare, in order to minimize the potential impact on civilians. Guterres said it is unclear how the Geneva Conventions, for example, which have long been looked to in order to regulate armed conflict, apply to cyber war. Some frameworks that have been implemented, such as the Wassenaar Arrangement, established in 1996 to control the export of arms, have had an unintended and adverse impact by making it difficult for cyber security researchers to conduct their work. For now, governments will have to largely rely on good habits like the regular monitoring of their national security assets, and on tools such as so-called honeypots - which leave seemingly sensitive data exposed in order to draw in and identify would-be attackers.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.38"
"4.164","Cybercrime","","Our lives have been made easier through the online connection of appliances via the Internet of Things, and increasingly powerful mobile devices. But this has also spawned more devices to potentially hack, and more opportunities to commit cybercrime. In the first quarter of 2018 alone, so-called distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, used by criminal hackers to overwhelm a website or service for the purposes of blackmail or revenge, were registered against targets in 79 countries, with the longest attack lasting 297 hours, according to the Securelist blog published by Kaspersky Labs. The arms race between creators and cybercriminals still favours those who wish to use their skills nefariously - as a result of both an increase in transmitted data, and attractive incentives for those able to discover flaws and sell their exploits on the black market. Criminals have found it to be lucrative to target both individuals and businesses, by holding technological assets hostage not only via DDoS attacks, but also with the use of so-called ransomware to first block a person or firm from accessing their data, and then demand payment in order to unblock access. The “WannaCry” ransomware attack unleashed in 2017 likely affected thousands of companies, in addition to the United Kingdom’s National Health Service and the Russian Interior Ministry, according to a report published by the consultancy EY. Cybercrime is not limited to the internet that most of us are familiar with. It also extends to the darknet, where interaction can remain anonymous. The darknet provides a large black market connecting nefarious dealers of illegal goods to anyone in the world, and is a haven for criminals selling stolen items, or customers seeking to purchase anything from illegal drugs to a hitman by paying in cryptocurrency. The darknet can also serve as a place to recruit agents to further spread ransomware on computers at their schools or companies. To better motivate these potential criminals, they can be offered the ability to automatically receive a commission if a related ransom payment is received. It is critical that businesses and other organizations take steps to prevent infection by ransomware. It is particularly important to train employees how to spot potential threats, and to institute policies that encourage workers to report potential security failures so that action can be taken quickly. Backup files should also be kept, and regularly updated.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","['1.38', '1.75']"
"4.165","Cyberthreats","","The increasing rate of cyberattacks directed against governments, businesses, and individuals has strained traditional lines of defense, while testing the political and legal structures designed to govern responses. Some prominent examples from recent years include a malicious campaign that targeted organizations involved in the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, with a Microsoft Word document designed to appear as if it was being sent from South Korea’s National Counter-Terrorism Center, and the “NotPetya” malware unleashed in 2017 - which caused billions of dollars in damage. A study published by Accenture in 2017 found that cybercrime was costing organizations an average of $11.7 million annually, and that a 23% increase in related average annual costs compared with the prior year was matched by a more than 27% increase in successful breaches per company. Many internet users are effectively unconstrained by national boundaries (even those within restrictive countries can turn to so-called virtual private networks, or VPNs, in order to maintain relative browsing freedom). This in turn increases the risk of ongoing, tit-for-tat cyber retaliation. Ways to solve the systemic issues that drive cyber events should be considered. As the world becomes more connected, it becomes increasingly important to ensure security and trust. One growing trend in recent years has been the use of cyberattacks to target critical infrastructure and strategic industrial sectors, raising the possibility of the disruption of systems that keep societies functioning, according to the World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Report published in 2018.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.85"
"4.166","Data Collection and Communication","","For policy-makers, analysing health data can help them to better understand the global burden of disease, and to more efficiently monitor and evaluate public health efforts. Technological advances in biotechnology and digital communications are expanding the use of so-called big data, or complex digital information that can be quickly analysed in unprecedented quantities in order to discern patterns and trends. However, there are emerging issues that can make the collection, access and application of this data problematic, related to how the data are collected, its quality, security, storage, and privacy. The United Nations Global Working Group on Big Data for Official Statistics was established in 2014, to address these issues by creating standardized methods for capturing, managing, and processing data efficiently, securely, and ethically. Since then, a number of private companies have pursued health data-related efforts; Apple, for example, has worked with Stanford Medicine researchers to determine if the Apple Watch can be used to detect atrial fibrillation - and if Apple can then notify wearers that they require medical attention. Simply improving the quality of data on health systems, prevention, reproductive health, nutrition, and demographics is not sufficient; more comprehensive information about the entire health ecosystem is required, on mobility, infrastructure, insurance, consumption patterns, and climate. Big data can be used to develop innovative health data analyses and management practices, and improve decision-making; data can also be used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of health practices, the social returns on investment in health outcomes, and to ultimately improve health systems and governance. Advances in big data have also changed the way disease can be tracked and contained, by using unconventional data sources to identify disease clusters and disease mobility. As the scientific community is learning to harness the power of anonymised data from mobile phone and internet use, prevention and treatment efforts can become more accurately targeted - to ensure the most efficient use of resources, and achieve the greatest possible impact. One example: a study published in 2017 in the journal PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases described using Twitter posts to obtain high-resolution data on the spread of dengue fever in Brazil - which enabled researchers to quickly map new cases, and predict where it might spread next.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.69"
"4.167","Data Into Action","","Biomedical informatics and data science help to translate data into actionable insights, which can in turn accelerate scientific discovery, improve care for individual patients, and impact the health of entire populations. These disciplines can intersect with the computational, quantitative, health, life, social, and behavioural sciences in formidable ways. In the context of Precision Medicine, often referred to as Personalized Medicine, the use of biomedical informatics and data science theories, methods, and tools have become increasingly critical. This is particularly true as we seek to advance our collective understanding of how bio-molecules, clinical features, and environmental factors correlate with disease risk, diagnoses, and the planning of treatment - and, perhaps even more importantly, how these features correlate with the maintenance of health before the onset of disease. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, machine learning, mobile computing, sensors, and human-computer interaction are extending the scope of data and analytical methods in ways that better enable the delivery of Precision Medicine. This has only amplified the unique and central role played by biomedical informatics in improving the health of entire populations.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.109"
"4.168","Data Localization","","Dozens of countries have either introduced or are contemplating data localization laws, which cut into the global nature of the internet by requiring that data generated online be retained on servers placed within national borders. The stated aims of localization are generally to protect personal privacy and security - though political motivations include a desire protecting local businesses, and controlling speech and the flow of ideas. Enacted or proposed related laws seek limits or restrictions on the storage, transfer, or processing of data, or require local data storage ownership (while others have local government procurement requirements). Localization laws passed in countries such as China apply to broad segments of industry and require data to be stored on servers placed within borders, while other countries, such as Germany and Australia, have industry-specific laws that require types of information such as medical records to be stored on local servers, according to an article published by the American Bar Association in 2017. Data localization laws are not necessarily new. Sensitive government data has long been subject to local requirements, in the US and other countries. In addition, more extensive laws applying to all forms of data have long been a feature of authoritarian governments. However, Edward Snowden’s release in 2013 of classified information, which described US government efforts to collect relatively unprotected data about the citizens of other countries, encouraged many governments to at least begin considering data localization laws. The proliferation of restrictive rules governing internet use, including data localization measures, threatens to hinder global commerce, however - and to hinder globalization more generally. A survey of more than 400 chief information officers and chief technology officers, published in a 2017 report by Accenture, found that 74% of respondents expected to exit a geographic market, delay market-entry plans, or abandon market-entry plans in the next three years as a result of increased barriers to globalization. For companies, the complexity of international operations will generally multiply in the near future as a result of measures like data localization rules, according to the Accenture report.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.85"
"4.169","Data Privacy","","Attitudes towards data privacy online are evolving; while prioritizing security above all may threaten the basic human right to privacy, prioritizing privacy over security may undermine our safety. Governments are pressing ahead with a variety of efforts to address data privacy. In the European Union, for example, the so-called General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force in 2018. It applies to companies that process the personal data of anyone living in the EU - no matter where that processing takes place. Under the regulation, companies will have to simplify their requests for consent to process a user’s data, and can be fined as much as the equivalent of 4% of annual revenue for not gaining sufficient consent. The regulation will also enable internet users to confirm whether their data has been processed, and why, and to receive a copy of their collected personal data upon request. In the US, by contrast, an internet user’s data privacy may depend upon the type of user, where the user is (which state), the type of data in question, and where the data has been deposited. Twitter, for example, has a feature specific to the company that provides a download of a user’s personal archive of activity on the social media service. The Children’s Online Privacy Protection rule, which enforced by the US Federal Trade Commission, requires companies operating websites directed at children younger than 13 to obtain consent from a child’s parent before collecting and using a child’s personal data. In China, data privacy protections are minimal, and internet users regularly face criminal charges including subversion based on their online activity, according to the watchdog organization Freedom House. The ability to remain anonymous online has been restricted in China, according to Freedom House, and companies and municipalities in the country have been testing ways to assess someone’s online activity alongside other personal data when that person applies for a loan or other type of service.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.85"
"4.170","Data Sharing and Permissions","","Data provide important insights, and we are witnessing a revolution in the ways that we collect, manage, and share these insights. The value of can data accrues as it accumulates, and even apparently unrelated datasets can deliver insights when they are juxtaposed. Combining multiple varieties of health data, for example, can yield benefits for preventive health and precision medicine (which is also known as personalized medicine, and involves using information about a patient’s genetic code and environment to predict and potentially prevent disease). The power of genomics-enabled health care is proportional to the amount of patient data that can be accessed and analysed, according to an article published in the journal Health Affairs in 2018. As a result, France has committed the equivalent of roughly $700 million to fund a genome-sequencing centre, and China has committed up to $10 billion to fund its precision medicine initiative, according to the article. For private health companies, such efforts could help them develop more sustainable and effective models for treatment. The greater sharing of information about cyberthreats and vulnerabilities could aid companies and governments in their ongoing battle for better resilience. However, opportunities for greater sharing must be balanced with several other important goals - not least the protection of individual privacy, and the enabling of internet users to make informed decisions on how information about them is being used. As cyberattacks have increased, the number of cyber information sharing organizations has expanded into an international network of about 350 recognized Computer Emergency Response Teams, a number of international cyber coordination organizations, and two dozen information sharing and analysis centres, according to a working paper published by the MIT Sloan School of Management in 2017. However, information sharing on cyber threats is still being hindered by privacy concerns, a risk of disclosing trade secrets and reputational damage, and potentially prohibitive costs (including those related to false positives), according to the working paper.

"4.171","Data and Analytics","","The International Organization for Migration’s Migration Data Portal, launched in late 2017, is designed to provide consolidated, timely information about migration in order to better inform policy-makers and the public. The potential results of improved data collection and analysis related to migration include more accurate measurement of the progress being made towards achieving the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, a set of targets designed to set a healthy global agenda which includes a number of migration-related elements. In late 2017, IOM Director-General William Lacy Swing noted during a speech that cultivating better data could also help to demystify migration. The use of so-called big data, or massive data sets that enable a more exact analysis of patterns and trends, can be an effective tool to help better understand changes in migration patterns, and migrant behaviour. There is no denying that huge amounts of relevant data are available; sources include proliferating mobile phones, GPS systems and internet-based platforms. New geospatial mapping and analysis technology can also offer the ability to more accurately predict, and better react to, displacement events as a result of extreme poverty, health crises, environmental impacts and conflict. As migration flows are liable to increase abruptly in response to outbreaks of armed conflict, threats to health or extreme weather events, organizations need to be as well-equipped as possible in order to provide assistance. As heavy flows of migrants were making their way through the Balkans on their way to points west in 2016, for example, the International Committee of the Red Cross asked the UN Refugee Agency if it could receive estimates of daily arrivals in order to ensure that it had an appropriate number of volunteers on hand. The UN Refugee Agency used data about daily arrivals to the Balkans it had been capturing since 2015, in order to create a dashboard that combined information about those arrivals with the current status of relevant borders and timely news articles, and was able to provide roughly accurate models of travel times (about three days in order to travel from the Greek Islands to Macedonia as of early 2016, for example, and about two to three days on top of that to reach Austria). Those models were in turn used to create daily forecasts. However, the agency quickly found that unexpected events like border closures could drastically impact the accuracy of their forecasts.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.98"
"4.172","Data, Security and Privacy","","The automobile is becoming the fourth screen for information, entertainment and communications; General Motors, for example, offers 4G data connectivity in all of its new cars sold in North America. By 2025, there should be about 470 million connected cars in the European Union, China and the US, according to research published in 2017 by the consultancy PwC. Ultimately, transport-related data generated in a car may actually become more valuable than the car itself - particularly as self-driving vehicles increasingly liberate people from driving and enable them to focus more on their devices while on the road. However, questions have emerged about who owns this data. Consumers, car dealers, original equipment manufacturers, and telecommunications carriers could all claim ownership in some way. Even more questions regarding data governance and ethics are raised by the fact that an increasing number of applications require artificial intelligence to manage related data flows. Data security is important for car buyers. Results of a survey published in 2017 by Thales e-Security showed that connected cars ranked behind only home security cameras or doorbells in terms of devices seen as most vulnerable to hacking, while nearly half of the survey’s respondents in the United Kingdom and the US feared related viruses or malware. Some 87% of survey respondents in the US, and 92% in the UK felt the government should implement stricter data security regulations for connected cars. Related security incidents can have significant financial repercussions. Following press reports in 2015 about the hacking of a Jeep’s dashboard, Chrysler issued a recall for 1.4 million vehicles that involved providing a USB drive with a security patch to customers.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.15"
"4.173","Data-enabled Business","","According to a 2017 white paper published by the World Economic Forum, digitalization is expected to create up to $305 billion in additional value for the travel industry between 2016 and 2025, while reducing the industry’s environmental footprint, and migrating $100 billion in value from traditional players to new competitors. Digitalization will also result in a net displacement of current jobs in the industry, as it is expected to only be partially offset by the creation of next-generation jobs, according to the report. Online travel aggregators and travel service platforms have shaken up the industry. All travel providers are now seeking ways to develop stronger interaction with customers, and adapting operations to try to both better understand their customers and to boost their own financial performance. Connected devices and artificial intelligence provide ample opportunities to make operations more effective, and enable collaboration and asset-sharing among travel enterprises. Ericsson’s 2017 Mobility Report counted 3.9 billion smartphone subscriptions worldwide, and projected that number to grow to 6.8 billion by 2022 - while more than 3 billion people around the world are using social media every month, according to an early 2018 estimate from the digital agency We Are Social. The combination of voice recognition, augmented reality and artificial intelligence will likely have a profound impact on the travel industry, by enhancing people’s ability to discover the world. To remain competitive, industry players must complement a high-touch approach with high-tech applications. Consumers want to feel special and expect the personalization of services and experiences. Digitalization could also have a potentially positive environmental impact, by contributing to a more sustainable industry footprint through innovation in manufacturing, and through more efficient resource use. Intelligent automation will change the nature of some travel jobs, and put other jobs at risk. It will also generate new employment opportunities that could outpace the automation of existing roles, especially as the industry is expected to maintain its growth. A concerted effort among industry players, governments, educational institutions and civil society will be required to best mitigate potential negative impacts.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.16"
"4.174","Decentralized Asset Management","","The growth of the sharing economy, which provides everything from vacation rentals to car service, can be better enabled through the use of blockchain. Thanks to its transactional capabilities, the technology is able to help co-ordinate loosely coupled assets, companies, and individuals, and can help dramatically reduce the transaction costs associated with both sharing business models and so-called “as a service” models. It also allows for radically new forms of ownership to emerge. In 2017, for example, the non-profit Crypto Valley Association in Switzerland introduced the concept of a Blockchain Crypto Property, or purely digital property rights registered on a blockchain that can be transferred around and carry out functions. Blockchain can also play a fundamental role in re-configuring how utility services are provided. For example, it can redefine how telecom network services are constructed and delivered, by changing how spectrum, or the radio waves needed for mobile phones and wireless networks to function, and physical infrastructure are delivered, managed and paid for. In addition, energy and water systems can utilize blockchain to create peer-to-peer energy markets that provide greater flexibility to users and infrastructure owners. A key challenge is presented by the need to measure the economic output of digital systems with large numbers of decentralized assets. Blockchain can assist in this task, through its ability to capture a record of transactions and bolster the data collection used to measure the digital economy. An increasingly digitalized world, however, means that the number and variety of cyberattacks are growing. In addition, data breaches are becoming more common, as reduced storage costs mean more data are being held for longer periods. The sensors that are increasingly a part of our daily lives also multiply the possibility of an attack. A clear understanding of the privacy policies and regulation associated with blockchains and similar digital technologies is required. Security concerns specifically tied to blockchain include the potential to take control of enough participating nodes in a ledger to tamper with the validation of transactions (a so-called “51% attack,” in the case of Bitcoin), and distributed denial of service attacks that increase processing time, according to a report published in 2017 by the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.24"
"4.175","Deepening Interdependence","","Once distant peoples and places are increasingly tied together by globalization, which involves not only the creation of economic links through cross-border trade and investment, but also stronger social ties, increased communication, and heightened shared risk tied to epidemics and the depletion of natural resources. As globalization has advanced, the ability to create peace and prosperity for any given society is increasingly affected by decisions made elsewhere. The creation and distribution of problematic mortgages in the US can lead to workers in Iceland losing their jobs, for example, while poultry market regulations in Hong Kong SAR can affect the health of citizens in Delhi. Meanwhile carbon emissions that occur in any single place in the world will affect the future of the climate everywhere. Managing this interdependence is the central task of global governance. However, the task is only getting harder. As globalization progressively spread following World War II, global governance became increasingly robust; the result was that it created the necessary conditions for globalization to further expand. When businesses branched out into foreign markets, for example, they developed multinational business models and value chains, which increased their need for, and creation of, effective governments and regulation wherever they operated - that, in turn, enabled other businesses to successively become more globally distributed. The result: a profound, self-reinforcing interdependence. But while a political issue like trade was once primarily tied to elements like tariffs, quotas, and other border issues, it now involves broader public concerns like health and environmental regulation, anti-trust laws, and privacy. To a greater extent than ever before, the economic prosperity, basic security, quality of health, and environmental well-being in any given locale now depend on decisions that are made abroad and applied across borders. This calls for strong, legitimate forms of global governance - though it remains unclear whether existing institutions are capable of managing this new reality.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.68"
"4.176","Defence and Security","","The importance of securing airspace has only increased, due to the deepening interdependence of all domains of war, including air, sea, land and cyberspace. Communications and guidance systems, at least to some degree, depend on maintaining control of airspace; satellite communication, and the use of electromagnetic spectrum more generally, are essential. The US alone had 803 operating satellites as of 2017, including 159 designed for military use, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists. Increasingly small and cheap unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, coupled with piloting and targeting systems that can be controlled with artificial intelligence, mean that a broader range of actors, with a broader set of motives (including war, surveillance, and terrorism) can now avail themselves of this technology. Meanwhile the traditional, offence-defence balance theory is tilting in favour of conventional air defence systems - as mobile, ground-based systems become both more capable, and more widespread. Long-range missile systems can detect even stealthy aircraft, while new related technologies such as laser weapons are becoming more prominent. Interest in missile defence has increased of late, amid concerns about North Korea’s weapons capability; in a related move, the US approved the sale of anti-ballistic missiles to Japan, which was in turn criticized by Russia. While space is becoming increasingly militarized in the form of so-called ASAT weapons designed to incapacitate satellites, and missile-defence systems, new capabilities such as hypersonic glide weapons are eroding the distinction between space and airspace. China, for example, has reportedly carried out tests of missiles propelled by a hypersonic glide vehicle, designed to fly at blistering speeds while remaining at a relatively low altitude, in order to elude missile defence systems.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.5"
"4.177","Defending Humanitarian Principles","","International humanitarian action rests on four principles: humanity, neutrality, independence, and impartiality. Aid work should be protected under international law, but once-reliable taboos seem to be fading: more hospitals are being bombed, more refugees attempting to cross the Mediterranean are being condemned to drown, more aid workers are being targeted by armed fighters, and more civilians are being starved into surrender. All of this is occurring with few consequences for perpetrators. Humanitarian principles themselves seem to be under attack, and the international community seems short of ideas to protect them. The world’s most vulnerable people are at risk of a vicious cycle where inequality and warfare drive them into destitution, while rising xenophobia and protectionism deny them of hope and relief. If aid is politicized - in order to further stem migration, lubricate alliances, or kowtow to domestic politics - that cycle could worsen. International humanitarian aid relies on shared values, collective action, and mutual support among states and aid organisations. But the international consensus is showing cracks across the board, whether it is related to forming alliances on climate change, human rights, migration, or the rules of war; opting out is in. Despite overwhelming pressures, some 570,000 people work every day on helping others in their hour of need. Humanitarian work relies on a general acceptance that it is well-intentioned, and has no hidden agenda. Preserving this trust requires maintaining high standards at aid agencies, and persuasive advocacy. It also relies on an international consensus to uphold humanitarian action and principles. Aid work amid war and human rights abuse, as in Syria and Myanmar, is especially vulnerable to accusations of bias, deliberately destabilizing authority, or aiding an enemy. Without a broad coalition of supporters, predatory governments or armed groups may feel entitled to block, intimidate, or even harm relief operations and aid workers. The same pattern plays out at the geo-strategic level; while the guardians of the Geneva Conventions - the International Committee of the Red Cross and Switzerland - have tried to formulate a mechanism to help monitor possible violations of humanitarian law, international division on the issue has doomed it to failure. Humanitarian action, busy mopping up man’s inhumanity to man, could use a little aid itself - because for all its flaws, it is doing vital work.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.74"
"4.178","Defining Corporate Purpose","","Business Roundtable, an association of CEOs of the largest American companies, has departed from a longstanding view that corporations exist to serve their shareholders. In 2019, the organization declared that companies should benefit all stakeholders, including customers, employees, suppliers, and communities - in addition to shareholders. This strongly reinforced the idea that profits are not the sole purpose of a business, and that corporations should exist to solve problems and provide services. If they are successful at doing this, long-term shareholder returns can increase, as society in general is better served. Establishing purpose is not an abstract exercise; it has proven to be essential for guiding decision making and for establishing priorities. London Business School Professor Alex Edmans has noted that as virtually all of the major decisions a company makes involve trade-offs, one of the main benefits of having a strong purpose is to guide these trade-offs. Purpose must not only be explicitly defined, however - it must also be implemented. Shareholders must understand the organization’s purpose, and be able to identify the metrics (both quantitative and qualitative) related to delivering on it. Some of these metrics incorporate the traditional concepts behind corporate social responsibility (CSR), such as maintaining positive working conditions and employee satisfaction, cultivating workforce diversity, and focusing on client satisfaction and product quality. But purpose can go well beyond CSR - one example is the clothing company Patagonia, which states that its reason for being is to help protect life on Earth. This is (presumably) understood by its investors, and implemented by designing, producing and selling products in the most environmentally sustainable way possible, and by building its supply chains and customer service around the circular economy ideas of repairing, reusing, and recycling. Responsible corporations create value for society and are motivated by the desire to do so. Survey results published by researchers at Stanford Graduate School of Business in 2018 showed that 65% of Americans believe CEOs at large companies should use their positions to address broad social, political, and environmental issues. That is to say, most Americans realize that corporations need to be committed to providing solutions and value to everyone - and that businesses have a responsibility to society.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.36"
"4.179","Deforestation and Climate Change","","The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions result from tropical deforestation. Because of the role that forests play in regulating climate, sustaining livelihoods, and supporting biodiversity, increasing deforestation in the tropics is a critical issue. Ten thousand years ago, forests covered about half of earth’s land. Roughly a third of these forests have since disappeared, converted for agriculture and other uses. Most forests still standing are degraded or fragmented; less than 20% are intact. Deforestation is concentrated in tropical, developing countries and is driven by the expansion of human settlement and the production of commodities such as palm oil, soy, and beef. International initiatives to reduce deforestation include the New York Declaration on Forests, which has had 180 nations, companies, indigenous groups and other organizations commit to cutting global natural forest loss in half by 2020 - and ending it completely by 2030. The Consumer Goods Forum, which includes global agricultural commodity companies and consumer goods firms, has pledged to work with suppliers and governments to eliminate deforestation from their supply chains by 2020. Forests are increasingly recognized in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. A related, voluntary program, REDD+, incentivizes developing countries to reduce emissions related to deforestation and degradation, and to increase conservation and sustainable management in exchange for results-based payments. The Paris Agreement, entered into force in 2016, has participating countries set voluntary targets to combat climate change; land including forests was accounted for in targets set by 82% of tropical countries. The Nature Conservancy has estimated that better land stewardship could achieve 30% of the climate mitigation needed to limit global warming to less than 2oC, an overarching goal behind the Paris Agreement. Eliminating deforestation in the tropics, particularly in places such as Brazil and Indonesia, would be a relatively low-cost, effective and natural way to address climate change. Despite decades of investment in combating deforestation, however, 2016 saw the largest amount of annual global tree cover loss in the 21st century to date, according to Global Forest Watch. Climate feedback triggered by climate change, such as a high incidence of wildfires, makes the need to reduce deforestation urgent. For efforts to succeed, however, greater vigilance on the part of governments, the private sector, and non-governmental organizations is required.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.54"
"4.180","Demand Evolution","","The 34 industrialized nations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development account for just 1.3 billion of the world’s 7.7 billion people. Non-member, developing countries are therefore poised to dictate the future of global energy markets. The pace and structure of economic growth in China, India, and the ASEAN nations (collective population: 642 million) will shape global energy demand, and will exert significant influence on trade patterns and geopolitics. While global oil demand is widely expected to continue growing well into the coming decade, there is a sense that passenger vehicle fuel demand in particular may peak soon - due to the adoption of electric vehicles, and to efficiency gains for internal combustion engines. While this could slow the pace of overall demand growth, a lack of alternatives to oil means it will likely remain a staple of heavy truck and air travel, which are poised to increase alongside economic growth. In addition, oil as a feedstock for plastics and petrochemical production is expected to increase. Global demand for natural gas is expected to continue growing, with the only uncertainty related to by how much - mainly due to its role in power generation. Gas-fired generation is often touted as an environmentally-suitable complement to renewables. However, there is a geopolitical aspect of demand to consider; a lack of local supply is making developing Asian economies more dependent on liquefied natural gas imports from China, while Europe is seeing a politically-motivated diversification away from Russian supply - which in turn is encouraging new entrants like the US (where both natural gas and renewables are continuing to replace coal-fired power plants). Technology also plays in potentially unpredictable ways into future demand. The electrification of transportation systems, for example, coupled with the increasing affordability of renewable energy technologies, may have a transformational impact. Policies and regulations related to these technologies, and to energy security, domestic resource development, and environmental protection, will also have an effect on oil and gas markets. In developing countries, related uncertainty and potential impact can be significantly greater than in the developed world, because local market structures and legacy infrastructure are relatively immature.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.104"
"4.181","Demand Shifts","","Demand for banking and capital market services is growing in developing countries, due to increasing affluence in these places. For financial firms to gain a meaningful foothold there, however, they require an inclusive strategy that can serve both large multinational companies with broad ambitions, and domestic clients aiming to tap new sources of wealth. The speed of financial democratization in these regions is tied to increasing rates of financial literacy and access to the internet; nearly half of the global population is now using the internet, according to a report published by the International Telecommunication Union in 2018, compared with just over a quarter of the global population as of 2009. Demographics, chiefly the ageing populations in many countries, also play a role in increasing demand for new financial products. The traditional world of pension funds, for example, was not long ago shaken up by the advent of low and even negative interest rates, which curbed the financial returns that can be delivered to pensioners (rates have more recently begun to increase); attempts to bridge this gap and find new ways to deliver returns generate risk for the entire financial system. During the financial crisis, there was a global increase in bank deposits - as a growing number of anxious people opted to park their wealth in the relative safety of a deposit account (rather than pouring it into generally more risky, interest-bearing investments). However, that trend has slowed in recent years, according to a report published in late 2018 by BBVA Research. While commercial bank deposits grew at an average annual rate of 6.6% between 2011 and 2015, that fell to 4.4% between 2016 and 2017, and then to 2.9% as of mid-2018, according to the report. While most banks have been able so far to avoid raising the interest rates that they pay on deposits in order to make them more attractive, that should change, according to the report - particularly as traditional banks also face increased competition from online players that have lower costs and more ability to entice depositors. Ultimately, banks with dwindling deposits could have trouble meeting loan demand, and may seek out alternative funding; that, in turn, could add more risk to the banks’ operations and hurt their profitability, and potentially hurt broader economies, according to the report.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.18"
"4.182","Demand from Institutional Investors","","Institutional investors are challenging their traditional relationship with private investors as they demand better performance and smaller fees for their investments. Institutional investors are also demanding more specialized products as opposed to the standardized options they have traditionally been given, forcing a major change in the asset owner–asset manager relationship. A large part of this change is driven by pressure on institutional investors to meet growing financial obligations in a low-yield environment. In response, many have increased their investment professional staffs and reviewed their relationships with private investors with a more critical eye. There is a growing sense among asset owners that asset managers are not doing enough to take their needs into account, with private equity limited partners believing the alignment of interests could be improved in areas such as management fees (54% of respondents) and carried interest (28% of respondents) according to a 2014 World Economic Forum report on Direct Investing by Institutional Investors. As a result of the changing market landscape and relationship dynamic, institutional investors have both demanded changes in the fee structures charged by the private investors, while becoming increasingly more active direct investors.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.110"
"4.183","Demographic Changes and Agriculture","","Demographic shifts are creating an older, wealthier, and increasingly urban-dwelling global population, and dramatically affecting the agriculture, food and beverage sector. About 140 million people are joining the middle class every year, according to a 2017 report published by the Brookings Institution, and that number should grow to 170 million in about five years - creating more consumers with more disposable income to spend in supermarkets and at restaurants. In addition, by 2050, a dramatically greater number of these consumers will be elderly and living in cities, portending significant changes in related consumption patterns; according to figures published by the United Nations, more than 2 billion people in the world will be older than 60 by 2050, and about 66% of the global population will probably be living in urban areas - compared with 54% as of 2014. Expectations for how products are delivered will evolve, as these demographic shifts bring about changes in how individuals consume, and what they consume. The food and beverage sector is expected to be highly impacted by trends including an increased demand for personalization, and for automatic replenishment via technologies like the Internet of Things, according to the World Economic Forum’s 2017 report Shaping the Future of Retail for Consumer Industries. According to the results of a survey published alongside the Forum’s report, more than one third of respondents wanted services that automatically send them food and beverage products when they are running low.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.9"
"4.184","Demographic Differences","","Perhaps never before have there been so many issues on which the perspectives of the young and old diverge. Young people in many countries are typically more concerned than their elders about climate change, for example, or about the future of work, minority rights, the availability of education, and the availability of future funding for retirement schemes. The World Economic Forum’s annual Global Shapers Survey for 2017, conducted with young people in more than 180 countries, found that government accountability and corruption topped the list of concerns for those between the ages of 18 and 35, followed by inequality (in terms of both income and discrimination), and then by lack of economic opportunity and unemployment. Meanwhile the elderly tend to place greater importance on issues including terrorism and the solvency of existing retirement schemes, according to a 2016 study published by the Pew Research Center. The fact that many young people have become deeply immersed in social media means they may have been presented with a different picture of reality than their elders, and they may begin to treat social media as a substitute for real participation in civic life. These generational differences could have serious consequences for the future of civic participation. In some public policy areas, such as climate change and LGBTI rights, young people have led the way in terms of fashioning political discourse. For example, the US-based organization GLSEN, which focuses on making schools inclusive and safe, named 18 young people as a “student leadership” team for the 2016-2017 school year; the group included a 16-year-old who led their high school’s Inclusive Queer Alliance in Dayton, Ohio, and a 17-year-old Chicana and intersectional feminist in Houston, Texas. While the internet has the potential to help young people express their views on social and political issues, and to organize around the issues most important to them, it also has the power to distract them from healthy participation in the public sphere - as its cacophony of unmediated information sources makes it hard to separate fact from fiction. Efforts implemented now to develop the ability of young people to distinguish among reliable and unreliable online influences could pay significant dividends in the future.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.33"
"4.185","Demographic Push","","Africa’s population is the fastest growing in the world, and also one of the youngest - while Europe’s features the highest proportion of people older than 60, according to a report published in 2017 by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Demographic disparities between developed and developing parts of the world promise to exert a powerful influence on migration and mobility patterns in the very near future. Geographically proximate regions, such as Africa and Europe, which feature growing demographic and economic disparities, are likely to be acutely affected by this trend during the second half of the 21st century.  Even when accounting for reductions in fertility rates in both developed and the least-developed countries, global population growth remains on track to present challenges for many countries and regions, which are likely to struggle with feeding, educating, housing and providing employment opportunities for expanding numbers of people. The incentive to migrate due to demographic pressure is likely to increase in many parts of the world, at least until improved education for girls and greater gender parity improve development outcomes and reduce both fertility rates and entrenched poverty. Meanwhile other countries and regions faced with rapidly ageing populations have a need to replace retiring members of their workforces and active contributors to their economies. This issue is most acute in Europe, where countries including Germany and the United Kingdom are among those where fertility was actually below the population replacement level between 2010 and 2015, according to the UN. Japan, where more than one quarter of the population was over the age of 65 by 2016, according to the World Bank, also faces a significant related challenge. International migration could provide a strategic benefit to such countries in need of replenishing their populations for economic, social, and political reasons. However, the ability to match labour market needs to migrant skills is likely to remain limited in many countries for the foreseeable future.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.98"
"4.186","Demographic Shifts","","Historically, travel was a luxury available only to those who could afford it. But falling costs, and increasing disposable income for the expanded global middle class, have fuelled a surge in international travel. International tourist arrivals rose to more than 1.3 billion in 2017, from 25 million in 1950, according to the World Tourism Organization; international arrivals are expected to reach 1.8 billion by 2030. By that point, most growth in international travel will come from outside of traditional markets in North America and Europe, and from markets in Africa, Asia and the Middle East. As emerging economies become larger sources of tourism they will also become more attractive destinations. The World Travel & Tourism Council has projected that between 2016 and 2026, the top 10 fastest-growing destinations for leisure travel spending will be India, Angola, Uganda, Brunei, Thailand, China, Myanmar, Oman, Mozambique and Viet Nam. Meanwhile roughly 140 million people join the middle class every year, according to a report published by the Brookings Institution in 2017, and about 88% of the next 1 billion people to join the middle class will be living in Asia. In China, travel is already increasingly popular even though as of 2016 less than 10% of Chinese nationals had passports, according to government figures. Millennials have made a unique contribution to the travel boom. According to a report published by travel news and data service Skift in 2016, travellers between the age of 18 and 34 tend to splurge selectively, by doing things like taking low-cost flights but going all out on experiences and restaurants. Millennials tends to want more control over their travel experiences, and they are willing to share their personal data to tailor those experiences, according to the 2016/2017 ITB World Travel Trends Report. Baby boomers also have a desire to discover. Unlike millennials, they have more disposable income to use on travel. The demographic is spending about of $6,000 on travel annually, according to the 2018 Travel Trends report published by the AARP, a US-based organization focused on the elderly. In addition to luxury, adventure, and eco-tourism travel, a growing number of boomers are pursuing medical travel. According to the publication Patients Beyond Borders, the total market for medical travel is between $45.5 billion and $72 billion, with as many as 16 million cross-border patients spending an average or as much as $6,000 per visit.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.16"
"4.187","Demographic and Demand Shifts","","Demographic shifts are having a dramatic impact on global demand for food. The global population is expected to grow from 7.6 billion as of 2017 to 8.6 billion by 2030, and then to 9.8 billion by 2050, according to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Most of this growth will occur in developing countries. In Africa, for example, the populations of 26 countries are projected to at least double in size between 2017 and 2050, according to the UN. Global food systems will need to be prepared to meet a significant increase in global food demand, while also providing for high-quality diets. Global urbanization is also affecting food demand. According to the UN’s World Urbanization Prospects report, the percentage of people living in urban areas will increase from 55% in 2018 to 68% by 2050 (in 1950, just 30% of the world’s population was urban). Of the 2.5 billion people projected to enter the urban population by 2050, nearly 90% of them will be in Asia and Africa. As societies become more urbanized, fewer people pursue farming, and lifestyles change; the share of resource-intensive food, which has a stronger environmental impact as it is produced, becomes more prevalent in people’s diets, and their calorie intake increases significantly. The rapidly-growing middle class in developing markets is now ignoring previous staples as it consumes more processed foods, meat, fish, poultry, and dairy. In the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations’ 2012 working paper World Agriculture Towards 2030/2050, the authors argued that the combined impacts of a growing population and an exploding middle class could increase world food demand by 60% by 2050, compared with 2005/2007 levels. Some potential ways of addressing growing demand have been identified. Research published by the University of Minnesota’s Institute on the Environment in 2013 found that only 55% of global crop calories were being consumed by humans, as 36% were being used for animal feed and 9% were being committed to biofuels and industrial uses. Growing more food exclusively for direct human consumption could increase available food calories by as much as 70%, and feed an additional 4 billion people, according to the study.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.60"
"4.188","Demographics Shifts in Switzerland","","Like many industrialized countries, Switzerland’s population is getting larger, older, and more diverse. Over the past 150 years the population has tripled in size, with 450 inhabitants per square kilometre now packed within a narrow strip running between Lake Geneva in the west and Lake Constance in the east - one of the most densely populated parts of Europe. Since 1995, the Swiss population has increased by 18% to 8.3 million, and is projected to reach 10 million by 2035, according to the Swiss Federal Statistical Office. The population growth of recent years has been mainly attributed to net immigration. Foreigners represent about one quarter of Switzerland’s permanent resident population, and more than half of the foreign population was either born in the country or has been living there for 10 years or more. This proportion of foreigner to national is one of the highest of any country in the world, and the majority of foreign residents come from a European Union (or European Free Trade Association) country. Switzerland’s communities share at least one attribute: ageing. According to the government publication Statistical Data on Switzerland 2017, the segment of the population aged 65 and over is projected to rise from 18% as of 2015 to over 26% by 2045; if it was not for the immigration of younger people to cities like Zurich, Geneva, Basel and Bern, the ageing effect would be even more pronounced. Average life expectancy among men is expected to increase from 81 years to 90 years by 2100, while for women it is expected to grow from 85 to 93 over that same period. The Swiss population has one of the highest rates of life expectancy in the world, which presents major challenges for the country’s pension system, healthcare system, and labour market. As in other developed economies, the pension system is at risk of collapsing. In 2017, voters rejected a pension reform plan proposed by the government, mainly because it placed a large burden on future generations. Switzerland is also witnessing growing wealth inequality. According to government data, in 2013 the top half of earners took home 80% of total income, while the bottom half brought home the remaining 20%.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.125"
"4.189","Demographics, Ageing and Real Estate","","Before the “silver tsunami” of ageing populations has maximum impact within the next couple of decades, real estate experts and urban planners must find innovative ways to construct environments that are better prepared. According to the United Nations, the global population of those aged 60 or older is expected to grow to 2.1 billion by 2050, from 962 million in 2017 - while the population of those over 80 years old is expected to grow to 425 million from 137 million over the same period. For planners, designers, and developers, this will have a significant impact on the ways that they approach their work. A transformation of the urban landscape that better caters to a rapidly ageing population, with neighbourhoods that are equipped with integrated senior housing, assisted healthcare facilities, and arrangements to facilitate increased mobility, is sorely needed. In addition to physical planning, there is a need for social welfare measures tailored for elderly populations, and for increased financial literacy and flexible financing plans such as reverse mortgages - which can provide financial support during the twilight years. Real estate can also provide a potentially ideal, relatively low-risk investment for the pension funds that elderly people rely on for their income. A report published by real estate investment firm JLL in 2016 suggested that global real estate transaction volumes would reach $1 trillion by 2020 (compared with $700 billion in 2015), largely due to greater interest from institutional investors like pension schemes.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.112"
"4.190","Design for Additive Manufacturing","","3D printing (or “additive manufacturing”) can produce lightweight structures with unprecedented, complex geometries, integrated sensors, and efficient, hollow and lattice structures. However, using 3D printing for parts can be challenging for designers. In the past, traditional guidelines for designers dictated that part shapes and features be kept as simple as possible, in order to reduce the number of required processing steps and the general cost of production. Entire generations of designers were trained to develop this mindset. Now, when designing for 3D printing, they are being advised to rethink traditional geometry and implement an approach inspired by lightweight, bionic concepts that can add significant value to a produced part. This requires an entirely new type of education (or re-education) in order to grasp all of the unique possibilities for using 3D printing to improve product functionality. Some related techniques include using dedicated software to reduce the weight of parts - which can be particularly useful in the aerospace and biomedical industries. While 3D printing can add value to parts design, certain constraints have to be taken into account. Parts always need to be designed for production while keeping their “build orientation” (the direction in which a part will be printed) in mind. This is one of the most important aspects of 3D printing, because it determines the anisotropy (the differences in a material’s physical properties when measured in different directions) of mechanical properties, surface quality, and the amount of support material that will be needed for the entirety of the printing process. The amount of support material should be minimized whenever possible, because it increases the total cost of material and lengthens the time required to remove material during post-processing. Large amounts of material usually add only a limited amount of engineering value to a part, and are also the main cause of increased residual stress (or stress that exists even after external force is removed). A study published in The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology in 2016 estimated that $667 million in value had been created by using 3D printing, equal to about 0.01% of total global manufacturing value added. Jabil, a US-based electronics manufacturing services firm, has reported that the use of 3D printing at one of its facilities led to a roughly 30% reduction in the cost of tooling, and an 80% decrease in the time required to make final tools and fixtures.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.0"
"4.191","Designing a New Social Contract","","Saudi Arabia’s oil wealth has traditionally been a key source of its political and social stability. The redistribution of this wealth has for many years provided well-paid jobs, a high quality of infrastructure, and good public services - while the House of Saud has maintained a stabilizing set of relationships with religious clerics, business elites, and tribal leaders. Efforts to maintain this social contract have been concerted; in response to the Arab Spring uprisings in the region in 2011, for example, the Saudi government increased its spending by about 25% over the prior year, which included roughly $130 billion in announced social spending that was meant to result in higher pay and bonuses for public-sector workers, according to Vision 2030 and Saudi Arabia’s Social Contract, a research paper published by Chatham House in 2017. Now, Saudi Arabia must come to terms with a future where oil plays a far less significant role in the economy - with inevitable consequences. Nearly two thirds of the Saudi population is under the age of thirty, and many young people are dissatisfied with the current, relatively conservative social structure. Increased global connectivity thanks to technology development has affected the way young people view the world, and the country has one of the largest social media markets in the Middle East. Meanwhile the King Abdullah Scholarship Program, initiated in 2005, has enabled many young Saudis of both sexes to study abroad and gain exposure to new cultures and ideas. A growing number of Saudi women have begun to bare their faces, and to let their headscarves fall back to reveal their hair, according to Saudi Arabia in Transition, a paper published by the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs in 2017. An increasing number of women also now have jobs and are financially self-sufficient, according to the paper. The government’s “Vision 2030” plan, a sort of national blueprint, promises a significant degree of social liberalization and educational reform. However, government efforts to both pursue reforms and transform the Saudi economy may result in additional discomfort in the form of lower public subsidies, and higher taxes - for the very same constituents who must buy into reform efforts in order for them to succeed.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.117"
"4.192","Destigmatizing Mental Health","","As much as 85% of the people living in in low- and middle-income countries who suffer from mental disorders, and as much as half of the people suffering from these disorders in high-income countries, receive no related treatment, according to the World Health Organization. Stigma and discrimination can result in a lack of access to care and services related to mental health, according to WHO fact sheet published in 2018, and people with psychosis are at high risk of exposure to human rights violations including long-term confinement in institutions. The stigma attached to mental illness functions in the same way as racism or sexism, according to a co-author of Ending Discrimination Against People with Mental and Substance Use Disorders: The Evidence for Stigma Change, a report published by the National Academies Press in 2016. According to the report, examples of institutionalized stigma in the US include limits on people with mental illness when it comes to serving on a jury or running for public office. People with mental disorders are also overrepresented in the US criminal justice system (both a consequence and a source of stigma), according to the report. Most people who have to live with mental illness have at some point been blamed for their condition, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness; their symptoms have been dismissed as a “phase,” and they have been discriminated against in violation of the law. The NAMI recommends several ways of fighting mental health stigma: talking openly about mental health; educating yourself and others about peoples’ experiences with mental illness; being conscious of the language used to talk about mental illness; encouraging people to equate mental illness with disease; showing compassion for those with mental illness (for example by engaging with homeless people struggling with mental illness); choosing empowerment over shame; being honest about the treatment received for mental illness; avoiding “self stigma” (by being as productive a member of society as possible), and by letting the media know when they have stigmatized mental illness via storylines or ignorant comments. In 2015, researchers from the University of Florida published results of a study on mental health de-stigmatization showing that negative perceptions based on a lack of information often fuel a fear of mental illness sufferers. These negative perceptions often came from negative portrayals of mental illnesses suffers in the media, according to the study.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.95"
"4.193","Development Outcomes","","Blended Finance enables the scaling up of financing for projects in emerging and frontier markets that would otherwise not be possible (or would be forced to develop at a slower rate, or on a smaller scale). As a result, it can deliver development impact through new jobs, access to affordable capital, and environmental and social benefits. One particular sector where Blended Finance offers the potential to mobilize finance on a significant scale for critical projects is infrastructure in developing countries. According to the 2010 World Bank report Africa's Infrastructure: A Time for Transformation, infrastructure development had been responsible for more than half of sub-Saharan Africa’s recent improvement in economic growth, yet less than half of the estimated $93 billion a year required to meet infrastructure needs in the region was actually available. Such imbalances are not limited to sub-Saharan Africa; a 2015 World Economic Forum blog post noted that infrastructure investment in Latin America needed to increase by an equivalent of between 2% and 3% of the region’s GDP in order to adequately facilitate long-term competitiveness. In addition, the Asian Development bank has estimated that there is a climate-adjusted annual infrastructure gap that impedes growth and is equivalent to 5% of GDP for developing Asian countries (excluding China). In addition to providing access to previously untapped commercial funding for projects, Blended Finance can also ensure better preparation of projects, and more efficient implementation for governments, by providing the discipline and expertise that can come with working alongside private sector partners. In addition, the mechanism can encourage further interest from institutional investors by creating new, large-scale opportunities for them. Currently, institutional investors such as pension funds, banks, insurance companies, hedge funds, mutual funds, and sovereign wealth funds allocate less than $2 trillion to the type of global infrastructure that can create significant benefits, despite an annual funding gap for United Nations Sustainable Development Goals development that runs to trillions of dollars. By making greater use of Blended Finance, governments, development finance institutions, donors, and other development funders can tap new capital pools necessary for making an impact in emerging and frontier markets - and for achieving Sustainable Development Goals.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.23"
"4.194","Diffusion of Governing Power","","Companies need to think through not only how they want to work with governments to help ensure social welfare - but also how, in some cases, they themselves will be on the front lines of technology governance. YouTube, for example, is assessing how its search algorithms can be refined in order to track instances of abuse like the use of video to spread extremist ideologies or images of terrorist acts. Meanwhile Facebook has come under increasing public scrutiny and criticism for its poor handling of user data. The media (and influential social media users) have key roles to play when it comes to communicating risks, opportunities, and concerns to the citizenry. The media will always be a target for criticism, as it has been with vigour under the Trump Administration in the US (both from the left and the right). In addition, media platforms have found it increasingly challenging to address broad audiences with coverage that is generally viewed as balanced, and so have sought ways to tailor news for specific communities - without having the resulting product degenerate into an echo chamber. The backdrop for all of this is the emergence of technologies that are shifting power and influence away from governments, and towards companies and non-state actors. This in turn is shifting and expanding the traditional view of governance. Even without a political mandate, technology pioneers are increasingly involved in developing private rules, certification schemes, standards, social norms, and policies that end up by default governing the ways that societies work, according to a report published by the World Economic Forum in 2018. These default norms and rules are often unrestricted by national borders. If government alone can no longer provide sufficient governance of emerging Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies, whether related to the commercialization of artificial intelligence, or the use of social media to influence elections, governance will have to come from new sources of authority and new models of collaboration.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.8"
"4.195","Digital Fluency and STEM Skills","","Technology is rapidly altering the ways we interact and work, linking communities and workers in increasingly sophisticated ways and opening up new opportunities. Young people therefore need to develop digital fluency, and science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) skills from an early age if they are to be equipped to thrive in the modern workplace - and in modern society. Learners need a deeper understanding of how to apply technology and innovation in order to achieve desired results. Education systems, meanwhile, need to ensure technology curricula are kept up-to-date, while teachers need to have the opportunity to refresh their own skills and knowledge in order to keep pace with external developments. The use of technology should be embedded across the educational experience, to mirror the ways in which technology is now relevant to all sectors and careers. Most jobs of the future will require a basic understanding of math and science. Ten-year employment projections by the US Department of Labor, for example, anticipate that of the 20 fastest-growing occupations for the period between 2016 and 2026, many will require an increasing understanding of math or science. Given the importance of STEM in the growth of future workplaces, it is important to ensure access to related education for all socio-economic groups. Girls and women are particularly underrepresented within high value-added STEM disciplines, and it is crucial to find ways to increase their presence.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.43"
"4.196","Digital Inclusion and Opportunity","","According to the World Bank, more than 1 billion people have no legal identity, with about half residing in sub-Saharan Africa. Nearly 40% of the total population in low-income countries has no legal identity (compared with less than 10% in middle-income countries), while one in two women in low-income countries have this problem. There are several ongoing efforts to help integrate excluded populations through digital means. The World Bank’s ID4D initiative, for example, provides countries with technical assistance and expertise to help them implement inclusive digital identity systems. Meanwhile the UN Refugee Agency and the World Food Programme are using iris scans to register refugees and displaced people, and help provide humanitarian aid. The UN estimates that scaling up these efforts could help about 66 million displaced people worldwide. However, there are risks associated with collecting biometric data - especially if a government is inclined to use it to surveil and subdue dissidents, or to exclude people from their rightful access to food and shelter. In addition, if an individual’s sole form of identity comes from a humanitarian agency it can complicate recognition from their home or host country. Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, is using digital health cards, biometrics, text messages and a mobile identity platform to improve vaccine delivery in developing countries. And the estimated 40 million victims of modern slavery, according to the International Labour Organization, could be helped by digital identity systems that track worker conditions throughout global supply chains. Austin, Texas is trying to help homeless people, who struggle to maintain physical forms of identification and often have fragmented health data, by developing MyPass, a blockchain-based solution that enables access to healthcare, employment or housing by attaching digital health records and other data to a person’s phone number or email address. While digital identity can better integrate populations, poorly-designed systems can worsen exclusion; fingerprints used for a biometric identity system can erode due to manual labour, for example, while systems that collect DNA and record ethnicity or religion can be misused to discriminate. Participatory design is key for any system serving vulnerable populations. Ultimately, every solution should account for differences in age, digital literacy, and internet access. Stakeholders in all sectors and industries should engage in evidence-based research supporting human-centered identity, engage civil society and the public in its design, and launch prototypes and pilots addressing identity challenges faced by vulnerable populations.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.41"
"4.197","Digital Infrastructure for Growth","","The German government has made its digital agenda a priority, as evidenced by the addition of a digital infrastructure portfolio for the Minister for Transport in 2013. However, in reality, the responsibility for the country’s digital infrastructure remains divided among at least five ministries, in the hands of three different political parties. The Minister of Economic Affairs and Energy holds responsibility for startups and the digital economy, the Minister of the Interior holds responsibility for e-government and cybersecurity, while the Minister for Transport and Digital Infrastructure bears responsibility for the deployment of broadband infrastructure. In addition, the Minister of Justice and Consumer Protection plays a role when it comes to data privacy, while the Ministry of Health works on the introduction of e-health systems. This blending of oversight makes it difficult to push reforms, and results in persistently vague political measures. It also potentially hinders the rollout of cutting-edge digital infrastructure, which is crucial to both maintain Germany’s digital competitiveness, and to address the public’s concerns over privacy. Germany’s Minister for Transport and Digital Infrastructure is further hobbled by uncertainty regarding the financing of broadband infrastructure. In addition, Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned against over-regulating the commercial use of big data, which is an important element of data privacy measures. After a first draft was withdrawn amid criticism in 2017, in 2018 Germany became the first European Union member state to successfully pass legislation implementing the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - which harmonizes and strengthens data protection for individuals within the bloc.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.66"
"4.198","Digital Policy and Governance","","The internet has been a principal contributor to the growth of the global economy for decades, and has the potential to continue to be a positive force for both the private and public sectors. But regulators must address concerns about the treatment of online data, and the security of networks. While leaders continue to struggle with the implications of technological transformation, businesses and ministries urgently need new reference models and organizational structures. While national digital policy frameworks can provide a foundation for innovation-led growth, their effectiveness relies upon models that are appropriately tailored for specific countries. A key digital policy focus for any country is an ability to better deliver public services. Digitally advanced governments, like Estonia, have achieved promising results as they structure policy to accommodate businesses, citizens and government agencies alike. To replicate this type of success, governments must develop a coherent plan for using personal data, and make that planning process transparent and inclusive in order to establish better digital policy and governance.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.78"
"4.199","Digital Teleportation","","With the emergence of virtual reality (VR), we can now fully immerse in any virtual environment that can be rendered in real-time using today’s graphics engines. New cinematic experiences recorded using spherical 360-degree camera systems enable us to have the experience akin to teleporting ourselves into arbitrary physical locations and time. Existing communication and internet infrastructures already further social interactions by bringing multiple remote users into a common virtual space. Through VR, collaborative tasks can be made more efficient and VR-enabled multiple player games become more compelling than their traditional counterparts. Nevertheless, VR presents a significant transformative opportunity where systems can go beyond just displaying 3D content by digitizing our appearances and mapping our physical actions faithfully into virtual worlds in real-time. When the day comes, where VR feels like a real physical experience and the gap between users and their digital avatars disappears, this technology will have the potential to become the next generation platform for face-to-face communication, social interaction, and even self-presence. In 2015, the MIT Technology Review reported that  a team of researchers at the University of Southern California, in collaboration with Oculus and Facebook, demonstrated the first prototype VR head-mounted display with facial performance sensing capabilities that mapped facial expressions onto digital avatars for immersive two-way communications. This emerging technology has not only sparked the interest of researchers in the computer graphics community and resulted in many follow-up projects by researchers at the University of Southern California, the University of Kentucky, North Carolina Central University and others, as well as start-ups such as Pinscreen, Loom.ai, BinaryVR, FOVE, AltSpaceVR, and High-Fidelity. Established VR companies such as Oculus & Facebook, Google VR, Microsoft, Huawei, and Tencent are also eager to explore social VR capabilities using virtual avatars. As the real-time rendering and simulation of digital humans is close to surpassing the “uncanny valley” – the idea that replicas of humans that are very close to actual humans elicit revulsion from some observers - a digital and immersive form of transportation could dramatically decrease communication-related modes of physical transportations (air, train, and car travel) and hence reduce energy consumption by several orders of magnitude. For instance, a 2017 call for proposals issued by the US Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) noted that roughly 8% of the energy consumption in the United Stages is related to travels for in-person communication. Current telecommunications technologies such as conventional video conferencing cannot fully displace physical face-to-face meetings due to the lack of essential human interaction characteristics. A study published by researchers from Ghent University in the Journal of Information Technology and Management in 2016 reported that the limitations of existing systems included the ability to build trust, communicate feelings, resolve conflicts and negotiate deals. However, with the recent advancements in VR, dramatic improvements in telecommunication technologies could enable highly effective “in-person”-like interactions that are actually conducted remotely. Transportation costs, time, and energy could be significantly reduced, while increasing work productivity. Such technology may also have a benefit for combatting some persistent challenges faced by telecommuters, such as remote workers feeling isolated or ineffective communications. By promoting efficient and multi-tasking telecommuting, employees can spend more time with their families, and businesses can reduce costs for office spaces. As a result, there will be fewer incentives to outsource. Similar to the effect of smartphones on modern society, in which our lives are impacted by constant connectedness, VR is likely to alter interpersonal communication and relations. While mobile devices and text messaging tend to reduce face-to-face interaction and family conversations, immersive telecommunication could potentially bring us closer again, though in digital form.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.133"
"4.200","Digital Trade","","Some have called data the new oil, because so much modern economic activity cannot occur without it. However, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development noted a crucial difference in a report published in 2019: unlike oil, data are not scarce, and can be distributed at virtually no cost. Cross-border data flows have grown dramatically, now that nearly half of the world is online compared with just 20% only a decade ago, according to a report published by McKinsey Global Institute in 2019. The growing importance of data means they must be able to flow freely across borders; digital products and services like cloud computing, the Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence will depend on this. Yet, some authorities believe the free flow of information poses a threat to public order, while there are other, legitimate data-restriction policy objectives that relate to privacy. This has led to the erection of barriers that limit the storage, movement, and use of data across borders, or “data localization.” In 2018, for example, India’s central bank announced that foreign payment companies would have to store local transaction data exclusively on servers located within India. In a bid to avoid the negative impacts of restricting data flows, some countries have included provisions on the free flow of data in trade deals. Recent free trade agreements have included binding provisions on data flows, and have prohibited data localization measures (examples include 2018’s Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Transpacific Partnership, the updated Singapore-Australia free trade agreement in 2016, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement signed in 2018, and the Australia-Indonesia free trade agreement in 2019). These deals have also addressed other conditions that enable digital trade, such as permanent moratoriums on custom duties, electronic contracts, electronic payments, and paperless trading. There is a growing recognition of the importance of fostering digital trade, including in the European Union - which had previously taken a cautious approach to the topic. Experience gained through existing deals and the political will of the international community (evidenced by signals sent from dozens of countries including the US and China at the 2019 World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos) may now result in a new agreement on electronic commerce under the auspices of the World Trade Organization - though the ultimate form of that agreement is still under negotiation.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.84"
"4.201","Digital Transformation of Bangladesh","","The sweeping digitalization accompanying the Fourth Industrial Revolution promises significant benefits for developing countries like Bangladesh. The country’s government aims to digitally transform its economy by 2030 - and according to the Ministry of Finance, budget allocations for information and communications technology are now 3.5 times greater than they were five years earlier. Some related initiatives include establishing connectivity via submarine cables, biometric registration for the use of mobile phones, and the introduction of Smart National Identification Cards. In addition, the government has introduced electronic tenders, while e-payments have been introduced, and projects tied to the online payment of value added tax (VAT) and the e-submission of tax returns are being implemented. The government is also promoting multimedia-equipped classrooms, paperless communication is being encouraged for inter-governmental communication, and initiatives are being undertaken to make the government more transparent through the online posting of documents and information. A relatively high rate of mobile phone penetration (87.7% of the population, according to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics) has meanwhile enabled the e-payment of utility bills. Mobile-based financial services such as bKash and Rocket have helped bring banking services to low-income groups, and have proven to be convenient, affordable, and reliable.   However, Bangladesh has a long way to go. According to World Bank data, only 18% of the population was using the internet as of 2016. Online-based businesses and services face difficulties outside of the capital, Dhaka, and there is a general lack of know-how regarding cyber security. The use of social media is expanding, though users are generally not well informed about the reliability of information they are exposed to. A strategic expansion of Bangladesh’s e-commerce industry is critically important; the country needs to remain engaged in World Trade Organization negotiations regarding e-commerce, in order to help ensure that measures are put in place that help developing countries build capacity. The country also needs to guard against the negative social issues that can be generated by social media, and to improve the use and analysis of big data in order to better understand consumer behaviour. The government’s introduction of new mobile technologies needs to be swiftly implemented, while education systems and curricula (and skills training) must be redesigned in order to better facilitate the country’s digital transformation.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.17"
"4.202","Digitalization and Chemicals","","As it did in previous industrial revolutions, the chemical and materials industry is playing a major enabling role in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. It is largely through the industry’s contributions that other sectors can turn their innovative ideas into products like touch screens, rechargeable batteries in portable devices, organic light-emitting diodes in flexible electronics, or the lightweight materials used to build drones. At the same time, the industry itself is being transformed through digitalization. Previously, the industry made use of digital technologies for process optimization and efficiency. Now, the digitalization of chemicals companies has expanded to focus on everything from the laboratory, to marketing and sales (through the extension of traditional product offerings with digital components), and new means of interaction with customers. The chemical and materials sector is generally seeking to stay abreast of pockets of digital disruption, including digitally-accelerated biotechnology that enables the direct-route production of chemicals, and the disintermediation of players from platforms. For example, large multinationals in the sector like BASF, Evonik, Covestro, and Solvay have launched online stores on Alibaba’s B2B platform 1688.com. Meanwhile startups such as ChemSquare, a global B2B matching platform for buyers and sellers of raw materials and ingredients used in food, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and animal nutrition, may disrupt the industry’s traditional procurement and sales processes. On the research and development side, companies such as BASF, Dow Chemical, and Evonik have announced partnerships with IBM and Hewlett-Packard related to data management, machine learning, and quantum computing technologies that could accelerate innovation. As the timing and scale of digital disruption is hard to predict, the industry operates with an awareness that it could be fundamentally altered at any time.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.28"
"4.203","Digitalization and Innovation Capacity","","According to the World Economic Forum’s 2016 Networked Readiness Index, the Russian Federation placed 41st out of 139 countries, ahead of China, Brazil and India, but behind Kazakhstan, Chile and Saudi Arabia. The country was rated relatively highly in terms of readiness and usage, but is constrained by a deteriorating regulatory environment, according to the index, which notes that local infrastructure development is not keeping pace with demand. The challenges and opportunities of the Fourth Industrial Revolution mean that the Russian Federation must take steps that account for new realities. The country’s solid scientific legacy means that if it puts in place necessary collaborative efforts, it could be well-positioned to thrive. Investing in technology and innovation must be prioritized. According to Russia’s National Technology Initiative, which was launched in 2014, the country currently has only a 0.28% share of the $773 billion global market for services for so-called factories of the future, though it aims to increase that share to at least 15%. Meanwhile the consultancy BCG found in 2016 that the Russian automotive sector, a key part of the country’s economy, invests significantly less in research & development than foreign peers; Russian automaker AvtoVAZ, for example, was found to spend less than 1% of its revenue on R&D, compared with 4% at most global manufacturers.  According to the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index 2017-2018, the Russian Federation ranked 38th out of 137 economies - an improvement compared with 43rd the previous year, and 45th the year before that. This was due to gains made in education, infrastructure and technological readiness. With its recently-implemented Digital Economy programme, the country is aiming to further promote the development of technologically advanced businesses, while other programmes are designed to modernize manufacturing and improve labour efficiency. The country's National Technology Initiative intends to position it as a global technological leader by 2035. The initiative covers several industries; in terms of the automotive industry, Volgabus is developing commercial driverless vehicles, while in the nuclear power sector the Rosatom State Atomic Energy Corporation is designing new management systems for complex engineering facilities. These and other industries will require talent that can thrive in technology-infused environments. However, Russia’s labour market is currently defined by skills more aligned with the Third Industrial Revolution than the Fourth. According to some estimates, by 2035, most production and supply chains will be fully automated. Given that between 60% and 70% of Russians are now directly or indirectly employed in mass production, the social and economic consequences of such a shift will be enormous, unless Russia takes steps to sufficiently prepare its labour force.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.116"
"4.204","Digitalization in Electricity","","The power sector is becoming increasingly digitalized, as computation and control technologies are embedded in systems around the world. This is spurring value creation, while creating cyber security risks. Digital technologies make it easier to communicate the value of electricity services with greater accuracy, as consumers become increasingly price sensitive and engaged. Meanwhile sensors and metering technologies are providing new visibility into power system conditions, and digitally-enabled power electronics and infrastructure are providing grid operators with an ability to act on newly-available information. Digitally-enabled demand-side resources, such as heating and air conditioning units and water heaters, are now active participants in the PJM market, which is the largest electricity market in the US. Nearly 11 gigawatts of demand-side resources provided electricity services in the PJM market in 2015 and 2016, and were the source of roughly $825 million in revenue in 2015. Meanwhile, companies including Amazon and Google sold more than 4.5 million digital “smart” thermostats in the US and Europe in 2016, enabling home and business owners to take greater control of their electricity use; increased participation like this provides a case study for the potential impact of the Internet of Things, which strings household devices together with online connectivity.   Greater digitalization is also expanding the deployment of advanced metering infrastructure. Over 60 million smart meters now measure the consumption of more than 40% of the buildings in the US. Smart meter deployments in the European Union are expected to reach 72% of consumers there by 2020, while China alone had deployed roughly 350 million smart meters as of 2016. Digitally enabled meters, paired with mobile technologies, are enabling new payment models that help bring power to some of the least electrified parts of the world. Digital grid infrastructure and data collection are meanwhile enabling more active network management; in the United Kingdom, UK Power Networks has developed a program to actively manage the output of wind power plants, enabling it to more quickly and economically interconnect generators and demand. Increased digitalization of the power system has also created new vulnerabilities, however - as demonstrated by the 2015 cyber attack on the Ukrainian power grid. As digital technologies collect valuable data, it creates the need for rules regarding how to securely manage this data, and new regulations that ensure utilities, and other power sector stakeholders, are adequately prepared for cyber threats.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.44"
"4.205","Digitalization of Supply Chains","","The management of supply chains is radically changing as a result of digitalization, the use of big data, and artificial intelligence; blockchain technology and the Internet of Things will also likely have a transformative impact. Major logistics providers like Maersk, UPS and FedEx are actively exploring blockchain in particular, which can provide an immutable record of contracts, assets and payments. Big data analytics, involving the detection of useful patterns in massive data sets, is made possible by the proliferation of sensors and tracking devices, and is both improving operational efficiency and spurring new business models. Meanwhile cloud computing has enabled more effective managing of inventory, and rerouting consignments or switching to alternative modes of transport at short notice; it also enables real-time information sharing that is helping companies collaborate. The global freight forwarding market, which generated more than $140 billion in revenue in 2016, according to a white paper published by the Focused Cargo Network, is being disrupted by online platforms that enable shippers to procure logistics services more flexibly and at better rates. Increasingly, to protect their margins and market share, traditional forwarders are embracing digitalization. Innovations in warehousing, such as robotization (automation) and the use of augmented reality, are increasing the speed, efficiency and accuracy of order picking operations. On roads, the electronic coupling of convoys of trucks into platoons to closely coordinate their operation has been shown to cut fuel consumption between 5% and 10%. The International Road Transport Union predicts that by 2030, around 10% of European long haul trucks will be travelling in platoons. The International Transport Forum suggests that a quarter of all trucks could be automated by 2040, while in the maritime sector, ship automation is being trialled. Road infrastructure is also becoming “smart” in ways that increase speed, reliability, capacity utilization and resilience. In addition, surface delivery robots (or “droids”) and aerial drones are being deployed for the so-called “last-mile,” or the final stages of a delivery - though their long-term impact on supply chains is difficult to predict. As news and entertainment media go digital, physical transportation of newsprint or discs is less prevalent, while 3D printing (which can be done outside of a traditional factory) offers the potential to significantly reduce freight traffic. The thousands of IT-related logistics startups listed in the Crunchbase registry indicate that many more digital innovations will impact supply chains in the near future.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.122"
"4.206","Direct Investing","","As the holders of “patient” capital, institutional investors play an important role in by helping to stabilize global markets while also funding long-term corporate growth, infrastructure development, and real estate. Any changes to the ways that asset owners allocate long-term capital can have a broad impact on society, and significant potential impacts on infrastructure and urban development. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, volatile, uncertain, and relatively unattractive returns on traditional investments encouraged investors to increase focus on illiquid assets - which are typically private equity-, real estate-, or specialized funds. US private equity funds, for example, have yielded relatively stellar annualized, compounded, net-of-fees returns over the past decade of close to 12%, outperforming all other asset classes. However, the potential for improved returns in illiquid asset classes has also led many institutional investors to explore the extent to which they can make these investments directly - and save management fees, while gaining greater control. There are constraints on the adoption of large-scale, institutional direct investing, however - particularly related to size. Only a very large institution can afford to run sophisticated, internally operated direct-investing teams at a lower cost than what would be incurred by fund managers. Direct investment will therefore not likely become the dominant institutional model, and instead will grow steadily in popularity, particularly for large institutions with flexible mandates and long-term horizons. State-owned sovereign wealth funds, for example, have increased their allocation to illiquid assets like real estate and infrastructure such that it now accounts for more than half of their total investment. These sovereign wealth funds have also displayed an increasing desire to team up with other investors, particularly as institutional investors in general move away from expensive, often ineffective external fund management towards internal portfolio management. Collaboration is a way to leverage limited personnel, to learn from investment partners, and to spread risk. Increased direct investment has implications for the global economy - it fosters long-term bets and therefore has a stabilizing, counter cyclical effect on markets. However, institutions as direct investors face daunting organizational challenges; whether or not they can succeed will depend largely on their ability to execute, source the right deals, and find the right talent.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.81"
"4.207","Disruption to Jobs and Skills","","As business models are disrupted, employment is being profoundly impacted. The result will be significant job creation and job displacement, in addition to both heightened labour productivity and widening gaps between the skills that employers need, and those that potential employees have. During previous industrial revolutions, it required decades to adapt - by building the training systems and labour market institutions necessary to develop new skill sets. Given the relatively faster pace and broader scale of disruption brought about by the Fourth Industrial Revolution, an interlude like that may not be an option this time around. The World Economic Forum’s 2016 Future of Jobs report suggests that mismatches may emerge not just between the current supply of, and demand for, contemporary skills but also between those contemporary skills and those that will be required in the future. Closing these gaps will require a solid understanding of the existing skills bases in particular countries and industries, and of how disruptive change will dictate new skills requirements in every case. Amid concern about high rates of unemployment in much of the world, mismatches and gaps in education systems are hindering the effective redeployment of underutilized, latent talent - at great human and economic cost. Workers need to be repurposed, across industries and with an eye to the skills required for the fastest-growing fields. According to the Forum’s Human Capital Report 2017, the number of people in the world with skills developed at a university or school is rising, but our understanding of how formal qualifications are distributed across industries and locations remains limited. Detailed skills information is critical for employers and employees, to better grasp what may be most transferable across industries. For example, an employer in the financial services industry facing a shortage of data analysts could reasonably expect to be able to consider applicants from a different industry - if there are identifiable, overlapping skills. Employers will need to increasingly think about how to tap this skills “adjacency,” in order to uncover hidden talent pools. Proactive talent management strategies are called for, as well as sustained dialogue and collaboration among businesses, governments, education providers, and civil society. As the where and how of work is transformed, it will lead to new management and regulatory challenges; and in an evolving labour market, preparing for the future is increasingly critical for seizing opportunities and mitigating undesirable outcomes. In the United Kingdom, artificial intelligence is poised to eliminate 7 million jobs by 2037, according to a report published in 2018 by PricewaterhouseCoopers - though it is also expected to create about 7.2 million new jobs in the country by that time, in healthcare, science and education. Business model disruptions will have a profound impact on the employment landscape, leading to both significant job creation and elimination, potentially heightened productivity, and almost certainly wider skills gaps. Given the likely depth of technological disruption to jobs, there is a pressing need to come up with more effective ways to facilitate the acquisition of skills and address job loss. During previous industrial revolutions, it has often taken decades to build the training systems and labour market institutions needed to develop new skillsets on a large scale. Given the pace of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, however, such a relatively comfortable interval may not be an option this time. In order to rise to the challenge that this presents, businesses will have to recognize human capital investment as an asset rather than a liability, according to the World Economic Forum’s 2018 edition of its Future of Jobs report. Many regions struggle with unemployment and inactivity, creating sizable economic knock-on effects. Skills gaps and innovation lag make labour markets less agile, and due to increasing rates of job disruption this trend is set to become worse. Meanwhile related regulatory and managerial challenges will only be exacerbated by gaps in knowledge. Real solutions will require that proactive talent management strategies be deployed by companies, alongside deep and sustained dialogue and collaboration among businesses, governments, and education providers. Workers in fields that are facing significant job reductions must be re-skilled, and provided with viable job transitions. The Forum’s Global Human Capital Report 2017 noted that gaining formal qualifications alone will not equate to necessary re-skilling; lifelong learning opportunities such as short-cycle courses, experience on the job, and exposure to new projects will be important in this regard. Any effort aimed at closing the skills gap will need to be grounded in a solid understanding of a particular country’s or industry’s current skills base, and of changing skills requirements due to disruption. Anticipating and preparing for future skills requirements will be critical for anyone who wants to seize new opportunities and new markets.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","['1.55', '1.135']"
"4.208","Disruptive Technologies","","In 2017, the commander of US Strategic Command disclosed a growing threat during congressional testimony: unauthorized drones, flying over Navy and Air Force installations and imperilling the security of nuclear weapons and personnel. The Air Force and Navy, he said, were working up plans to track and potentially “engage” these unmanned aircraft - which are among a number of emerging, technology-related threats to nuclear security. There is a lack of adequate defense against drones launched for nefarious purposes; shooting them down can be difficult, while jamming their operation could threaten the operations of the nuclear facilities on the ground below. In addition, conventional radar cannot detect small drones flying close to the ground. In France, nuclear power stations were subjected to a mysterious and disturbing epidemic of unmanned drone flights in late 2014 and early 2015. While French authorities insisted that the facilities were designed to withstand security risks including drones, the flights raised fears of potential terrorist attacks. The actual motive for the drone flights has yet to be identified, however. Greenpeace has warned that even a medium-sized drone is capable of carrying an explosive charge large enough to damage the pools of cold water where spent nuclear fuel is stocked - and potentially releasing radioactive material in the process. In France, which is more dependent on nuclear power than any other developed nation (the World Nuclear Association has reported that nearly three-quarters of the country’s electricity is nuclear-generated), such an attack could be particularly disastrous. The key to countering this potential threat could come from an unlikely source: more drones. As the security-minded begin to think creatively about countering drones, including celebrities keen to better protect their privacy from paparazzi, a number of efforts have been made to develop unmanned aircraft that can disable other unmanned aircraft. A bid to develop a drone dubbed “Rapere,” which could safely disable the rotor blades of intruding aerial unmanned vehicles, surfaced in the US in 2015. Other startups have taken different approaches; a French firm, MALOU-tech, has developed quad copters equipped with nets to intercept drones in the air, while UK-based OpenWorks Engineering has developed a handheld cannon that can launch disruptive netting at drones flying above.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.102"
"4.209","Doing No Digital Harm","","Humanitarian action has only just begun to experience the kind of digital disruption that has already upended other sectors. The digitalization of aid will have far-reaching effects on a sector that is still structured around post-World War II institutions. While this could help meet needs more effectively, humanitarian managers are nonetheless focused on a new dictum: “do no digital harm.” Digital technologies offer new ways of helping and monitoring developments on the ground - and keeping track of people, money, and supplies. They also give new agency and options to people affected by crises. The internet and open data can shed light on even the most isolated parts of the world, for example, even when official sources of information are patchy. Data analysis techniques can help form new insights and spot trends; the data analytics firm Palantir, while better known for its work in defence, has also been working with humanitarian agencies’ datasets in order to help monitor conflict and food supplies. Meanwhile the World Bank has called in some of the world’s biggest technology companies to help it use artificial intelligence to predict famine. People affected by humanitarian disasters need smartphones to keep in touch, find out where to go, or call in family support. Supplying WiFi and battery charging have therefore become a routine part of humanitarian response; connectivity is becoming a recognized need, if not (yet) a human right. But there is a risk in all of this digital development, and tightening up data protection has therefore become a priority. Aid sector technology systems have often been built ad-hoc, and lack the robust data protection and cybersecurity that are standard in the private sector. The need for a framework for responsibly handling new digital ID systems is becoming urgent, as personal details about more than 20 million vulnerable people are sitting in cloud-based databases run by aid agencies. These records contain data about family circumstances, income, and place of origin - as well as fingerprints and iris scans. Such technology-based systems can offer compelling advantages; by digitally removing duplicates and ghost entries, a recount of refugees in Uganda in 2018 reduced the official headcount from 1.4 million to 1.1 million, for example. On the flip side, however, personal data can be hacked or misused by governments and criminals, creating new problems for people who are already among the most vulnerable.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.74"
"4.210","Domain Name System","","Responsibility for the domain name system, a sort of phone directory that makes the internet accessible via designations such as “.com” and “.net,” was shifted in 2016 from US Department of Commerce oversight to a global, multi-stakeholder community made up of the non-profit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and international organizations. The move was seen as important for preserving international support for, and contributions to, internet governance by diminishing the influence of the US - though ICANN itself remains headquartered in California. ICANN’s job has become more complicated in recent years, as the variety of so-called “top level” domains has expanded well beyond “.com” to include more specific designations that may offer security and operational benefits. Amazon.com, for example, has sought to secure the “.amazon” domain, over the objections of governments in South America that argue that a designation related to the Amazon rainforest should not be assigned to a private company. There were 332.4 million domain name registrations across all top level domains as of the end of 2017, or a 0.5% increase compared with the third quarter of that year, according to VeriSign, a private company that contracts with ICANN. VeriSign said that “.com” was the most popular designation overall, with nearly 132 million reported domain names, followed by China’s domain “.cn,” which had 21.4 million reported domain names, Germany’s “.de,” at 16.3 million, and “.net,” at 14.5 million. The “.tk” domain, which belongs to the small, island country Tokelau, was actually the third-most-popular designation behind “.com,” with 19.9 million reported domain names - as it has been used to provide domain names free of charge.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.85"
"4.211","Domestic Political Pressures","","In many countries, the politics of national identity are intersecting with geopolitical trends in disruptive ways, and creating potentially destabilizing feedback loops. Many politicians have secured power, or are seeking it, on the basis of promises to redress imbalances attributed to globalization, by prioritizing the demands of the domestic population - particularly in relation to jobs and migration. In a growing number of countries, populist platforms have been blended with the use of identity politics in order to win or maintain support, often by aggravating grievances and exacerbating fears; examples from around the world abound, including in the US, India, various European Union member states, and Turkey, and have been intensified by social media - which in just a relatively short space of time has evolved into an important driver of political polarization. Domestic identity politics is both cause and effect when it comes to the current, tumultuous phase of geopolitics. A growing number of political leaders who owe their domestic positions to assertively nationalist or protectionist stances are now shaping the interaction among states at the global level. This has eroded global institutions and alliances, and hindered efforts to create new alternatives. At the same time, there is increasing evidence that intensifying geopolitical competition is an amplifier of divisive domestic political trends. In part this is because it encourages leaders to double down on nationalist narratives, but it also reflects the fact that there can be geopolitical incentives to exploit the political, social, and ethno-religious divisions that exist in other countries. Foreign intervention of this kind can take many forms, such as active support for a preferred political candidate, or efforts to destabilize entire political systems in rival states. Increasingly prevalent technologies and tools, including social media platforms and big data analysis, are an important part of this story - particularly with respect to cyberattacks and the spread of disinformation. In fragile states in particular, outside interference in domestic politics tends to sustain and harden existing divisions, drawing out political or even violent conflicts and hurting the chances for reconciliation, while sometimes reversing a country’s healthy transition to democracy.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.65"
"4.212","Domestic and Foreign Security","","The election of President Emmanuel Macron in 2017 strengthened France’s global engagement and influence, propelling the country to the top of the annual Soft Power 30 index that year (it subsequently slipped to 2nd place in 2018). France is playing a leading role in fostering international cooperation and integration, defending democratic values abroad, and campaigning for a stronger, more united Europe with a common defense force and budget. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, France has deployed thousands of soldiers across Africa as part of peacekeeping operations addressing complex humanitarian, political, and security crises. The country has also joined the international coalition effort to combat the Islamic State militant group. Security issues are among the primary concerns of French citizens; more than half believe France ought to be better prepared for external threats, according to a Jean Jaurès Foundation and Sciences Po poll conducted in 2017. France’s history and expressed values, coupled with its military interventions in Africa’s Sahel region and the Levant, make the country particularly vulnerable to domestic and foreign security issues. Since 2015, France has been the victim of a series of terrorist attacks targeting civilians and soldiers. As a result, national security and terrorism are at the heart of domestic and foreign policies. Macron has set a goal of meeting NATO’s defense spending target of 2% of GDP by 2025, which would be an increase from the current level of 1.5%. The human, material and financial resources needed to meet France’s domestic security and military commitments are considerable, and the current budget does not allow the country to ensure its international presence in this respect. However, a defense budget increase could have serious implications for the rest of the economy. Over the past decade, 40% of France’s spending cuts were related to defense; if the country allocates additional annual funds to its military budget as it plans to, it is vital that the money be wisely spent. According to the French think tank Institut Montaigne, the country’s current priorities should be restoring military capability, modernizing and replacing military equipment, strengthening participation in nuclear deterrence, and increasing investment in research.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.56"
"4.213","Driving Africa’s Growth","","Entrepreneurs in Africa inhabit a fragmented, dynamic space that hovers between legitimate and illegitimate economies. That is in part a reflection of a society that is relatively less engaged with formal banking and payment services. As recently as 2014, only 34% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa had access to any financial services, according to the World Bank’s Global Findex Database; the version of the database published in 2018 found that in eight out of 10 economies in the region, more adults reported having saved money semi-formally than “formally” - that is, with a bank account. The interest rates on loans from traditional banks are generally prohibitive for regulated small businesses, while those operating in the informal economy are often ineligible for financing. That has had a limiting effect, but has also been an impetus for technology innovation; the 2018 World Bank database found that 21% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa had a mobile money account, the highest percentage of any region in the world. The further development of basic communications technologies and infrastructure is essential for lowering African entrepreneurs’ operating costs. Globally, Africa is contending with a changing landscape - as traditional trading partners have faced economic slowdowns and economic interest from large emerging economies, particularly China, has grown. While Africa’s economic growth in recent decades has been impressive, high levels of inequality and youth unemployment have persisted. That could breed social discontent, and threaten political stability. A Boston Consulting Group study examined income per person, jobs, governance, health, and inequality, and found that general well-being in significant areas of sub-Saharan Africa is relatively low. Meanwhile 17 of the 20 lowest-ranked economies in the World Economic Forum’s 2018 Global Competitiveness Index are in sub-Saharan Africa, and most economic activity still takes place in the informal (illegitimate) economy; 66% of all non-farm employment in sub-Saharan Africa was informal as of 2015, as was 52% in North Africa, according to International Labour Organization estimates. Sub-standard access to education and health care for those living in poverty further aggravates inequality, making it harder for the disadvantaged and their children to improve their economic status. And yet, inequality is not always an explicit focus of African governments.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.6"
"4.214","Drought and Energy Mix","","Water is a significant factor in most economic activity, in addition to being a vital life source - and South Africa is a water scarce country. In 2017, drought conditions forced Cape Town to designate “Day Zero,” a point in August 2018 when all taps in the city would run dry; it was subsequently pushed back to 2019. The Department of Water and Sanitation has reported an overall decline in water quality between 2012 and 2014, and millions of people in rural areas still lack access to clean drinking water. While municipalities supply water and maintain infrastructure, they are dependent on the federal government and decentralized water boards for water supply. As a result, charges applied to water users lack a systematic relationship to costs - even though appropriate pricing could be an effective mechanism for ensuring efficient and productive use. Since 2005, demand for electricity in South Africa has outstripped supply, resulting in rolling blackouts. Over the past two decades, the government estimates it has provided electricity to 6 million poor households; however, the last mile of connectivity between the central grid and homes requires added infrastructure. It is essential to diversify South Africa’s energy mix, in order to lower pollution and ease the effects of climate change - and there is potential to tap renewable and clean energy from wind farms in the Eastern Cape. Meanwhile food security can only be attained when everyone has access to sufficient, nutritious food, and South Africa has many households that are classified as food insecure (the Department of Agriculture has estimated that between 1999 and 2009, more than one third of the country’s households were food insecure). However, it is difficult to assess the actual extent of food insecurity, and to adequately address need; it is therefore necessary to standardize related data collection and analysis. Climate change poses a threat to sustainable domestic food production in the country, while productive land is not always optimally utilized. Small-scale farmers are faced with the challenge of limited access to processing facilities and markets. In addition, rising input costs such as electricity, water, and labour affect the ability to sustainably produce food. Efforts to increase market linkages and access to electricity and water are essential to ensure sustainable food production, and potentially boost rural development.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.119"
"4.215","E-commerce and Demand Chains","","According to research firm eMarketer, global online retail sales will reach almost $5 trillion by 2021, and account for nearly one fifth of total retail spending. The supply chain challenges presented by this trend stem not only from expanding sales, but also from the increasing expectations of customers. Product range, and speed of delivery, have become major competitive differentiators. A survey conducted by the publication Business Insider found that the portion of US online retailers with a same-day delivery capability more than tripled between 2016 and 2017, to 51%. This emphasis on rapid fulfilment and product customization is now making the term “demand chain” more appropriate than “supply chain.” The demand chain impact is most visible on the so-called “last mile.” In the early days of online retailing, this largely entailed van deliveries to homes. Today, shoppers can receive orders at gas stations, train stations, lockers and even in the trunk of their car. Servicing such dispersed demand has required the development of new “omni-channel” distribution systems that require the careful coordination of IT, inventory, handling and transport. This is a particular challenge for traditional retailers diversifying into the online market and adapting their legacy infrastructure accordingly. ﻿Last-mile delivery has become a fertile area for innovation. Online “crowdshipping” platforms are engaging people in the delivery of parcels, often in the course of their everyday travel, while drones and surface delivery robots, or “droids,” can provide automated delivery. The roll-out of the Internet of Things permits automatic replenishment to smart refrigerators and cupboards, while Amazon now offers what it claims is secure “in-home” delivery. Radical change is also occurring in less visible parts of the supply chain. E-commerce has enabled manufacturers to bypass traditional wholesale and retail outlets and sell directly to customers, for example. And manufacturers can use both the platforms and logistical systems deployed by large online retailers such as Amazon and Alibaba, in order to extend their own reach. The fulfilment of international orders remains a challenge, however, as smaller players with modest volumes face relatively high shipping rates and cross-border administration hassles. Large online retailers are exerting increasing influence on the global freight market. Amazon has acquired its own fleet of dozens of Boeing jets, and is establishing its own airfreight hub. Meanwhile JD.com, China’s second largest online retailer, is partnering with China Eastern airlines to build national and international logistics networks.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.122"
"4.216","Economic Diversification","","The unpredictability of global energy supply and demand creates significant uncertainty for the Russian Federation’s economy. Other aggravating factors of late include a depressed ruble, and economic sanctions imposed by Western countries. The country has responded with a policy of import substitution, or shifting from reliance on imports to producing more goods at home in order to generate growth. The policy provides an opportunity for self-sufficiency and local industries, particularly agriculture. However, true self-sufficiency will take time. In addition, some Russian manufactured goods are not competitive on global markets. Logistics remain key to the economy, and the further development of ports in the east could provide an important gateway for Europe, with increased related infrastructure investment. Meanwhile climate change-induced warming in the Arctic is opening up opportunities for increased Russian shipping and resource extraction in that region. The Russian Federation will ideally transition its industry to what has been referred to as “Russia 4.0,” or a state of production that efficiently leverages the business models and technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. In this regard, Russia could adopt a tailored, asymmetrical approach to production development, with increased investment in select technology areas and regions that can in turn support infrastructure and the labour force. Refocusing the government on creating efficient and transparent conditions for industry development, and on the diffusion of emerging technologies, while better aligning the interests of commercial and research institutions, will be key. The country currently suffers from several barriers to technology adoption in production, including restricted access to foreign technology, a shortage of financing options, and outdated regulation. However, the Russian Federation also has distinct advantages that could help it overcome these barriers: its relatively late entrance into high-tech production may enable it to leapfrog to state-of-the-art standards and processes; it has successful, innovative companies that can champion technology development and adoption; and the government has unveiled several initiatives that make technology transfers and innovation priorities. Russia’s workforce lacks the skills necessary to meet the production demands of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Both government and business leaders have prioritized short-termism over innovative approaches. Even if leaders wanted to invest in upskilling workers - which many do not - there is a dearth of programmes in the country capable of providing necessary training. If proper steps are taken, however, Russia’s labour force could represent a competitive advantage. The country’s education system already prioritizes science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses, and the population is relatively digitally-literate. By aligning education more closely with the needs of industry, and by incentivizing creative thinking and collaboration, Russia could better leverage its labour force in the future.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.116"
"4.217","Economic Diversification and Sophistication","","Colombia continues to depend heavily on natural resource-intensive industries for economic growth. According to the CIA World Factbook, as of February 2018 Colombia was the fourth-largest oil producer in Latin America, and one of the world’s main producers of coal. Rents and royalties paid by the mining and energy sectors have enabled the Colombian government to increase funding for public programs. However, because industries like oil and coal account for over half of the country’s exports, Colombia is particularly susceptible to commodity market fluctuations. A shift towards higher value-added activities could reduce the country’s related exposure. One obstacle to lessening dependence on extractive industries, however, is Colombia’s limited participation in trade agreements. Colombia’s agricultural sector has stagnated. Agriculture as a share of total GDP fell from 8% in 2000 to 6.3% as of 2017. While the economy has grown by 4.1% per year on average over the past decade and a half, agricultural sector growth has been just 2.3% per year. More closely tying the sector to global value chains is essential to diversify Colombia’s economy and help reduce inequality. Farmers and indigenous communities also need to develop sustainable land-use practices and forest conservation mechanisms. The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) recommends directing more public investment to the sustainable development of rural areas, greater formalizing of land ownership titles, and the expansion of credit for small farmers. Colombia’s services industry, particularly the travel and tourism sector, represents an important opportunity for economic diversification. The number of foreign tourists traveling to Colombia has surpassed global and Latin American averages; international arrivals increased by 16% in 2015 compared with the prior year, according to the World Tourism Organization. That was significantly higher than the 8% increase for Latin America as a whole, and 4.3% increase worldwide during the same period. According to the Colombian Ministry of Trade, Industry and Tourism, tourism accounted for 1 in every 11 jobs in the country in 2015, and was the third-most-important source of foreign currency earnings after oil and coal. A 2018 report published by the IDB cited access to finance as one of the greatest potential obstacles for companies in Colombia, particularly small- and medium-sized enterprises. This issue is not trivial; the IDB reported in 2015 that while small- and medium-sized firms represented 99% of the country’s business sector that year, 80% of private employment and 35% of GDP, these companies only received 14% of all commercial loans. Causes include shortages of eligible collateral and weak contract compliance. The cost of taking out a loan is high in Colombia, compared with other emerging economies. According to the World Bank’s World Development Indicators, the spread between the average active rate paid by borrowers and the passive rates paid by lenders exceeds 7% in the country; it is around 1.8% in Chile, and close to 3% in other, similar economies. This situation is partly caused by the distortions such as the concentrated nature of Colombia’s banking sector.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.35"
"4.218","Economic Institutions","","Traditional balances of power are being disrupted, as emerging economies both create new international development organizations, and seek to gain more influence over existing institutions. China, for example, has actively promoted the development of alternatives to the Bretton Woods institutions, such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which have been used since World War II to govern the international economic system. The Washington, D.C.-based IMF manages financial crises and balance of payments problems (the organization supplied a $50 billion loan to Argentina in order to help that country avert a crisis in June 2018, for example), while the World Bank (also headquartered in Washington, D.C.) provides loans to countries in order to build infrastructure. Both institutions are often perceived as furthering US policy. In order to provide an alternative to the World Bank, China, along with its partners, helped to lay the groundwork for the BRICS bank, now known as the New Development Bank, which was established in 2014 with its headquarters in Shanghai. At that time, an Op-Ed published by the Brookings Institution described the new institution as a potentially positive way to address shortages of infrastructure investment in developing countries, though it cautioned that China’s economic heft relative to its partners in the endeavour threatened to make coordinating funding priorities difficult. China’s influence on the IMF has been growing. Since October 2016, China’s Renminbi has been included in Special Drawing Rights, an IMF international reserve asset backed by a basket of currencies in order to provide liquidity to countries in need - alongside the US Dollar, Euro, Japanese Yen, and Pound Sterling. In addition, since 2011, a Chinese national has served as an IMF deputy managing director. Critics from emerging markets have generally argued that such changes are occurring too slowly. However, a recent shift in US policy has created even greater opportunity for countries such as China to gain more sway when it comes to the IMF and World Bank, as the US takes a more adversarial approach international institutions generally. Alternative economic institutions had already tested relations between the US and traditional allies; for example, the US had sought to discourage the participation of Germany and France in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which began operations in 2016.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.64"
"4.219","Economic Integration","","The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region is a more open and accessible market than both the European Union and the US, according to the World Economic Forum’s 2016 Global Enabling Trade Report. That same year, 2016, ASEAN as a cohesive unit gained its highest share of world trade since 2010, accounting for 7% of the world’s total merchandise trade, according to the World Trade Organization’s World Trade Statistical Review 2017; the region’s positive trade balance that year was $62 billion. As of 2015, the main recipients of ASEAN exports were China (12% of the total), the US (11%), and the EU (11%), according to the WTO publication. Overall, total merchandise trade in ASEAN rose by about 50%, to $1.14 trillion, between 2006 and 2016, according to the publication. As the trade in goods and services between ASEAN and the rest of the world has increased, so has the movement of workers abroad. The numbers of both men and women from ASEAN living abroad each increased to more than 9 million respectively by 2013, from less than 4 million each as of 1990, according to data published by the International Labour Organization. Following the launch of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) in 2015, ASEAN member states have formed a tighter economic grouping. The AEC aims to foster a single market and industrial production capacity, increase competitiveness, support inclusive growth, and further integrate the region into the global economy. Developments since the formation of the AEC include plans announced in 2018 by firms in Malaysia and Indonesia to jointly develop and manufacture what would be the region’s first automobile. The AEC comes at a delicate time for global trade, however. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which includes ASEAN countries, Australia, Canada and others, was reformulated in 2018 following the withdrawal of the US from the agreement, for example. ASEAN is seeking a more important role in negotiating the proposed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which in addition to ASEAN countries includes Australia, China, India, Japan, South Korea, and New Zealand. At the RCEP’s intersessional ministerial meeting held in Tokyo in July 2018, attending ministers recognized the importance of swiftly concluding negotiations in light of the current global trade environment and the heightened risk of unilateral trade actions and reactions, according to a joint media statement.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.2"
"4.220","Economic Reform in Viet Nam","","Viet Nam’s economic growth, following market reforms implemented by the communist state in the 1980s, has been impressive - though it has recently slowed. For the past decade, average annual growth has been about 6%, compared with 6.6% during the decade prior to that. Efforts to recapture higher growth rates have seemingly been exhausted. While the government has set a target of between 6.5% and 7% annual growth between 2016 and 2020, this will be challenging due to lingering structural weakness in the banking sector (and in state-owned enterprises), and excessive levels of public debt. Viet Nam’s credit boom roughly a decade ago was accompanied by uncontrolled lending, the poor handling of credit risk, inactive internal auditing, and compromised supervision. The credit rating agency Fitch Ratings noted in a report published in 2017 that the Vietnamese banking system’s officially registered ratio of non-performing loans at that point, 2.5%, probably understated the severity of the issue. High levels of bad debt have seriously weakened the banks’ balance sheets, and related regulation and supervision should be improved. The privatization of state-owned enterprises in Viet Nam began more than a quarter of a century ago. While several conglomerates have since been privatized, the state still holds major ownership stakes in key sectors such as banking and aviation. Successful examples of enterprises that have benefited from privatization include the dairy company Vinamilk, and coffee maker Vinacafe. However, the privatization process has slowed in recent years, as proposals have been queuing up for approval. A revamp of the privatization process could enable greater participation among foreign and domestic investors in the country’s economy, and improve the performance of large firms that consume a large portion of Viet Nam’s natural resources. Meanwhile the country’s deficit and public debt levels have raised concern. Public debt as a percentage of GDP reached 61.5% in 2017, according to the International Monetary Fund, nearing the 65% ceiling established by Viet Nam’s National Assembly. Borrowing by state-owned enterprises and public investment projects have made it challenging to remain below this target. Maintaining a high debt-to-GDP ratio contributes to economic instability, and increases the risk posed to businesses. Comprehensive fiscal reform, and more sustainable management of public debt, should be priorities.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.132"
"4.221","Economic Sanctions","","Economic sanctions restrict or eliminate another country’s international trade and financial interaction, in order to achieve foreign policy or security objectives. Sanctions can be applied by individual nations, groups of states, or international organizations, and targets can be countries, specific industries within a country, or individuals - denying them entry abroad, freezing their assets, or restricting their financial dealings. However, sanctions regimes often fail to quickly produce results; if they persist over long periods, perceptions of their purpose can shift. For example, US and European Union bans on the sale of military equipment to China imposed in 1989, in the wake of the Tiananmen Square protests, remain in place - leading many to suspect their purpose is now simply to restrain Chinese military development. In addition, many remain convinced that western sanctions imposed on the Russian Federation in 2014, with the purpose of reversing Russian policy on Ukraine, were really aimed at undermining Russian leadership and slowing the country’s economic growth. Meanwhile restrictions that the Russian Federation imposed on Georgian agricultural products in 2006 have been interpreted by some people as intended to deter the smaller country from aligning with western countries. Sanctions regimes can be organized through international agreements and institutions - as is the case with the control of commodities, technologies, and equipment linked to the development of nuclear weapons, and implemented through the Non-Proliferation Treaty and the International Atomic Energy Agency. The United Nations Security Council has used sanctions to back up its resolutions with force, as it has confronted terrorist organizations, armed groups in Africa, and the North Korean nuclear programme. Regional blocs like the EU also make use of sanctions; in 2014, the EU hit Russia with sanctions that included asset freezes and visa bans for 149 people, and a cancellation of bilateral EU-Russia summits, in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The US has applied its own sanctions against Russia, in response to alleged cyberattacks and interference with the 2016 presidential election. The US has punished entities for violating its sanctions, aided by the importance of its financial industry to the international system. In 2014, the US fined French Bank BNP Paribas $8.9 billion for violating its sanctions on Cuba, Iran and Sudan.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.64"
"4.222","Economic Shifts","","A deep and rapid integration of the global economy has rebalanced economic power, and created complex new economic and financial interconnections. In the two decades leading up to 2017, the share of global output accounted for by developing economies jumped to 59.3% from 42.8%, with much of that shift accounted for by China - which alone went from contributing 6.6% of global output to 18.7% over the period. China’s integration into the world’s economy has been one of the most significant global developments since the end of World War II. Changes in relative economic power have led to accompanying shifts in the global balance of geopolitical power, though the influence of economics on geopolitics is not restricted to GDP growth. Increasingly, governments reach for economic and financial policy levers in order to advance national ambitions, in both the economic and political realms. The dividing line between economics and national security has therefore blurred, sometimes as a matter of policy - as in the case of the US Department of Commerce’s strategic plan for 2018-22, which states that “economic security is national security.” The increasingly domestic lens through which states assess their international economic policies and priorities has weakened support for the global economic governance framework in place since World War II. Efforts made over decades to deepen global trading relations have given way to a patchwork framework that is showing signs of systemic fragility; the US’s blocking of new appointments to the World Trade Organization’s Appellate Body is one such sign. Meanwhile some countries are taking more mercantilist approaches to trade, and see their bilateral relations as part of a geopolitical zero-sum game with winners and losers (the successive rounds of tariffs levied by the US and China on one another during 2018 are a case in point). Trade is not the only economic policy area being used to advance broader national ambitions. For example, there has been a resurgence of the use of economic and financial sanctions, while foreign direct investment, long a key channel through which states create cross-border links, has also been affected. China’s massive, infrastructure-focused Belt and Road Initiative is an ambitious, and controversial, example of a strategy of concerted outward investment with geopolitical ramifications; the flipside of this is the growing number of countries creating barriers to inward investment which is perceived to threaten strategically-sensitive industries.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.65"
"4.223","Economic and Social Complexity","","Rules governing behaviour are the fundamental platform on which human economic and social relationships are built. Taken together, the formal rules of a legal system, informal cultural rules, and the formal and informal institutions that determine whether these rules are followed constitute a form of infrastructure. This infrastructure dictates property issues, contracts, freedom of action, entitlement to compensation, physical security, and other building blocks of economic activity. It is a mechanism used to ensure that economic activity is efficient, sustainable, and consistent with social values, and that governments do not exploit their powers - and that they do help us strive for equality, fairness, dignity, and peace. As societies grow more complex, they require different legal infrastructure; that is, new rules and systems that can better respond to changing economic activities, environments, values, beliefs, and a shifting understanding of how societies work generally. Today, we are faced with exponential growth in complexity. Globalization is connecting economic actors, individuals, and communities in increasingly dense webs of interaction - generating unpredictable dynamics. This challenges assumptions about how things should be done. The speed and scope of technological innovation on multiple fronts, like artificial intelligence and robotics, 3D printing, cryptocurrencies, space travel, and genetic engineering, create a constant stream of novelty and uncertainty for the legal world. Meanwhile growing income and wealth inequality, and a burgeoning need to participate in the so-called knowledge economy, is creating backlash against long-held policies in advanced economies. Social media platforms allow groups regardless of size or distance from the mainstream to voice, spread, and act on their views, in a landscape that shifts on a daily basis. The global scale of threats such as climate change, terrorism, and autonomous weapons calls for shared policies across an enormous range of communities. Theorists define complex adaptive systems as networks of interactions between independent agents, each making predictions, following rules, and adapting in order to achieve goals and produce what theorist Stuart Kauffman has termed a “dancing landscape.” This process, which can be almost impossible to predict, represents the landscape in which our efforts to shape the transformations of the Fourth Industrial Revolution while maintaining economic and social progress are taking place. Developing smart, adaptable legal infrastructure that can handle the economic and social complexity of the modern world is perhaps the most fundamental challenge we face.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.90"
"4.224","Economic and Social Structures","","Blockchain is the first truly digital economy technology - one that brings economics and technology together in a genuinely novel way. It enables the redefinition of trust not just within industries, but also across societies. Many aspects of current interaction on the internet could be improved by blockchain, for example, thanks to its ability to handle verification and transactions in a peer-to-peer, secure way that does not rely on large intermediaries. Supply chains, the essential circulatory system that ensures that global commerce can carry on uninterrupted, may receive a healthy re-balancing between local and global due to the use of blockchain; as a mechanism for exchanging value and creating an immutable record of transactions, even small companies could use blockchain to better collaborate and in some cases even compete with global players. The technology could also help to reduce environmental damage, by cutting down on the unnecessary transport of goods around the world. The so-called “greening” of global supply chains will require greater traceability and transparency, according to a report published in 2017 by the International Finance Corporation (IFC). Blockchain, as a system that effectively cannot be tampered with, can provide more reliable information on where food originated and how it was produced, according to the IFC report.  Blockchain can also create new insights for regulators, who may in some circumstances and at certain times need to see the provenance of different elements within a supply chain. For example, within a food supply chain, the technology can provide greater transparency when it comes to food scandals or contamination, enabling regulators to see exactly what areas have been affected and to better direct their efforts at solving problems. A number of startups are working on related issues, including a United Kingdom-based company that launched a pilot program in Indonesia that uses blockchain-enabled tagging to track tuna fishing, according to the IFC’s 2017 report. A key challenge with blockchain is ensuring that industrialized systems based on the technology are robust and secure enough to handle the volume of transactions that occur in large supply chains. For example, transactions on blockchain in the Bitcoin cryptocurrency currently require an average of 10 minutes to be confirmed, and the system is limited to a throughput of around seven transactions per second - due a trade-off between scalability and resilience against malicious actors.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.24"
"4.225","Economics and Finance","","Behavioural insights are starting to have serious implications for individuals’ savings accounts, corporate balance sheets and national budgets. They key on the fact that humans, even when making consequential financial decisions, do not always act rationally - but are instead prone to biases. A typical example is the so-called “anchoring effect” during negotiations; offers have a tendency to be strongly influenced by the first number tossed out. If a buyer therefore gets to make his or her offer first, and offers a relatively small sum, this should draw the ultimate, agreed-upon towards the lower end of the spectrum. One prominent intervention, “Save More TomorrowTM,” developed by behavioural economists, leverages a decision bias dubbed “hyperbolic discounting” to help people increase retirement savings. Hyperbolic discounting has two components: people strongly wish to avoid costs they have to incur sooner than costs they can delay, and this preference for later becomes less pronounced over time. Consequently, employees are more willing to sacrifice a fraction of their current salaries to increase their retirement savings, if the sacrifice is delayed. As part of “Save More TomorrowTM,” an employee is approached by a financial consultant as early as possible, before a future pay raise, and asked if he or she wants to increase their contribution to a pension fund with the first pay check after the raise. Contributions are then increased with each raise up to a predefined maximum, unless the employee wishes to opt out, which they can at any time. The program has helped millions of people increase their retirement savings. Governments can benefit from behavioural insights, too. People can be motivated to pay their taxes, if states acknowledge and reward good behaviour, and demonstrate good public use of tax money. A 2017 working paper published by the Inter-American Development Bank cited a study in which 400 individuals from a municipality in Argentina were randomly selected from a pool of 72,000 people who had paid their property taxes. The selected taxpayers were publicly recognized in a highly visible way, when the government built new sidewalks in front of their houses. Those who received the new sidewalks were 7% more likely to pay their property taxes over the following three years, according to the study. In addition, the neighbors of those who received the new sidewalks were also more likely to pay their taxes in the future.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.20"
"4.226","Economics of Environmental Sustainability","","In late 2018, the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued an alarming report noting that global temperatures are on track to be 1.5°C higher than the preindustrial era as soon as 2030. Currently, at 1°C warmer than the preindustrial era, we are already experiencing severe consequences of climate change including forest fires in the Arctic, and the increased intensity of hurricanes. A 1.5°C increase would mean more rapid sea level rise, hot extremes in most inhabited parts of the world, a higher probability of drought, and other risks to human security and economic growth, according to the UN report. Climate change, pollution, and resource depletion have been impacting the economic productivity of both countries and private companies. These forces also disproportionately impact the poor, exacerbating socio-economic inequality. According to an edition of the International Monetary Fund’s World Economic Outlook published in 2017, the per capita GDP in a typical low-income country will be 9% lower by 2100 than it would have been in the absence of climate change-related temperature increases. A subsequent edition of the outlook published in late 2018 noted that robust global economic growth will require better buffering low-income countries against the effects of climate change, with things like climate-smart infrastructure. While weather shocks tied to climate change have an immediate impact on agricultural production, they also have broader impacts related to labour productivity, mortality, health, and conflict - as threats to food security aggravate already-simmering issues in fragile states. According to IMF calculations, a temperature increase of 1°C to the median, low-income developing country temperature of 25°C can reduce crop production and agriculture value added (the processing of raw materials) by between 1% and 2% annually. Agriculture and farming in the oceans also face significant climate-related challenges. Climate change-related changes in marine fisheries production may be just as large as those in crop agriculture, according to a report published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in 2018; primary production of the global ocean is expected to decline by 6% by 2100 (and by 11% in tropical zones), according to the report. Economic policies and business practices need to better take environmental constraints into account, in order to make stable growth and freedom from conflict realistic possibilities for future generations.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.58"
"4.227","Economics of the Fourth Industrial Revolution","","Responses to technological change can determine the shape of economic progress. Technology that can serve to automate tasks now performed by significant portions of a country’s existing workforce, for example, can potentially do at least as much damage to the social fabric as the good it can do for productivity metrics. According to a report published by the McKinsey Global Institute in 2017, as much as 14% of the global workforce will need to switch occupational category by the year 2030 as a result of increasing automation. In addition, according to the report, all workers will have to adapt as their occupations evolve alongside increasingly capable machines, by attaining a higher level of education or by spending more time on honing the human aspects most difficult to automate - like creativity, and emotional skills. The Fourth Industrial Revolution presents a turning point for human development, as the rapid pace of technological change tests social cohesion, and demands bold policy responses in order to better foster innovation, develop sound economic policy, and prudently increase productivity. According to market-research firm Gartner, the total number of connected devices is expected to more than double between 2017 and 2020, reaching 20.4 billion. New technologies can help generate economic growth; the Internet of Things, which strings together myriad, everyday devices with online connectivity, can for example help cities more efficiently use power needed to light streetlamps, by sensing when they are really needed and when they are not (Barcelona is an example of a city deploying the technology for this purpose). Meanwhile companies in countries including China and Japan are developing robotic exoskeletons designed to boost worker productivity. On the one hand, such devices could help address the problem of ageing workforces (particularly in countries with demographics like Japan’s), by keeping more workers on the job for more years than they would be able to manage otherwise. On the other hand, greater automation via robotics may also add further downward pressure on wages earned by low-skilled workers. Leveraging the potential benefits of technology in the interest of more inclusive growth will require active preparation for possible future economic and social repercussions – such as increased unemployment, and the widespread failure of overwhelmed welfare systems.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.58"
"4.228","Ecosystem for Innovation-Driven Entrepreneurship","","As global competition becomes increasingly innovation-driven, a vibrant innovation ecosystem can be a critical national or regional competitive advantage. Silicon Valley provides an illustration of the necessary elements: universities and public research labs that not only generate cutting-edge knowledge, but also facilitate commercialization through licensing or spinoffs; a prevalence of experienced angel investors and early-stage venture capital firms; large, dynamic companies that are willing to work with startups by providing corporate venture funding and buying their products and services; and a diverse culture that tolerates failure. Also critical are policies that help protect intellectual property rights and efficient bankruptcy laws - in order to better facilitate serial entrepreneurship. Where critical elements are missing or underdeveloped, government participation in the form of co-funding schemes to stimulate angel investing, and subsidies for incubators and startup accelerator programs may help to fill the gap.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.47"
"4.229","Education Gender Gaps","","The development and deployment of female “human capital” (a way of describing the knowledge, creativity, and other measures of a worker’s value) is a critical element of global economic growth. As successive generations of educated women now enter the workforce, economies can only fully utilize their talent if there is a corresponding narrowing of the economic gender gap, or the nagging difference between women and men when it comes to making an economic impact. Progress made in addressing the education gender gap could set the pace for the erasing this disparity. According to the World Economic Forum’s 2017 Global Gender Gap Report, young women and men entering the labour force around the world have nearly identical educational qualifications, with some regional variation. There is near parity in terms of participating in primary and secondary education, for example, though there is a 7% gap when it comes to participation in tertiary (such as a university or technical training) education. According to the report, on a country-by-country basis, primary education gaps have been closed in 67 countries, secondary education gaps have been closed in 101, and tertiary education gaps have been closed in 93. However, girls comprise a marginally larger proportion of children (under the age of 15) not attending school, according to the report, and a much larger proportion of youth (older than 15) not attending school - 23% of girls, compared with 15% of boys. Among women and men who are over the age of 25 and already in the workforce, the educational gender gap is even bigger: 11% for primary education attainment, 17% for secondary education, and 14% for tertiary. However, gaps have narrowed significantly among those currently enrolled in education, which should be reflected in the composition of the future global workforce. An important point raised in the Forum’s report is that the core, post-secondary disciplines where women continue to remain under-represented are in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, or STEM, fields. Just 6% of women study engineering, construction and manufacturing, compared with 19% of men, for example, while 3% of women study information, communication, and technology, compared with 6.5% of men. This discrepancy is commonly attributed to negative stereotypes, a lack of role models, and hostile work environments. It is a key gender parity issue, as STEM-related careers will likely be among the most sought-after as the Fourth Industrial Revolution progresses.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.63"
"4.230","Education Innovation","","Technological innovation is changing the way educational materials are generated, the manner in which educational content is distributed, the way learners engage with materials, and the processes used to evaluate educational outcomes. Technology companies such as Amplify and Knewton are digitizing textbooks and creating content based on gamified learning. Other companies such as Coursera, edX, and Khan Academy are revolutionizing education delivery through so-called Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Still, some education systems, especially at the primary and secondary level, have been slow to incorporate even the most basic, widely available learning technologies. Technology presents opportunities to deliver learning in new, gamified, and personalized ways, which could change the traditional role of teachers and facilitate a blended learning experience. Technology has been proposed as a solution for resolving issues related to unequal access to education, for example in rural or hard-to-reach communities that nonetheless have digital access. New research from pedagogy, psychology, and other fields indicates areas that are ripe for innovation, especially when it comes to personalized learning. However, research has also highlighted that new learning tools do not always enable engagement with hard to reach groups - and it is critical that the drive towards education innovation is matched by a monitoring of its effectiveness in providing the right returns. Funding should be strategically allocated to trials, and successes can be grown to scale. Greater public-private collaboration aimed at expanding this opportunity would be beneficial.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.43"
"4.231","Education in Brazil","","Brazil ranked 121st out of 140 countries in terms of quality of vocational training in the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index published in 2018, 124th in terms of the skill sets of all graduates, and 125th in terms of the digital skills of its population. While access to education in the country has expanded in recent decades, improving its quality remains a challenge. Data from international assessments demonstrate that Brazilian students perform significantly below their peers when it comes to reading, math, and science. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s PISA survey conducted in 2015, for example, ranked Brazil 59th out of 72 countries in reading, 63rd in science, and 65th in math. A World Bank report published in 2018 suggested that at the current rate of improvement, it would take more than 260 years for 15-year-olds in Brazil to reach the rich-country average score in reading - and 75 years to reach the average score in math. There are large and lingering education inequalities among Brazil’s regions and socio-economic strata, as well as between the sexes. Despite the fact that the literacy rate among women between 15 and 24 years of age in Brazil increased to 99% by 2017, from 84% in 1980, and the fact that roughly two-thirds of university graduates in the country are women, female labour force participation in the country rose by just one percentage point between 2005 and 2017, according to a report published by the World Bank. Inequality is still evident in the country’s educational infrastructure, in the training of its teachers and administrators, in the availability of materials and technologies, and in the degree of involvement of civil society groups and the private sector. Investment in education in Brazil should involve a more strategic focus on quality and equality, accompanied by better coordination among each level of government. Private sector participation in education is expected to grow, as the government seeks out more innovative ways to deliver results.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.26"
"4.232","Education, Science and Technology","","Access to primary and secondary education in Colombia has improved, and post-secondary education opportunities such as university programs have expanded. However, according to Fedesarrollo, a research institute, persistent inequality in terms of both education access and the quality of education have particularly affected low-income populations in marginalized rural areas, and members of ethnic groups. That means the country’s talent pool is not being fully utilized, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)’s Colombia Country Note Education at a Glance 2017. While only 22% of adults in the country have a tertiary (from a university or trade school) degree, too many students have been enrolled in higher education programs relative to more practical technical education programs. There are also inequalities between socio-economic classes when it comes to academic performance. The World Economic Forum’s Inclusive Growth and Development Report 2015 noted that just 1.5% of students from poor backgrounds in Colombia placed in the top quartile on the OECD’s PISA math assessment, compared with figures ranging between 12% and 15% in countries such as the Republic of Korea and Singapore. In order to improve the quality of education in Colombia, both increased investment and the efficient and equitable use of those funds is essential. The Colombian government should implement policies aimed at attracting, developing and retaining the best teachers, and teachers' salaries should be comparable to those offered by other competitive professions. Guidance should also be provided to the lowest-performing schools and teachers, and priority should be placed on rural areas with higher rates of poverty. Total research & development investment in Colombia in 2015 was equivalent to just 0.2% of GDP, well behind the OECD average of 2.5%. The Forum’s 2017 report Bridging the Skills and Innovation Gap to Boost Productivity in Latin America suggested providing tax incentives to firms that conduct R&D, regardless of their size, supporting public-private funding schemes for basic and applied research and skills development, and forging stronger links between academia and businesses. Other issues that must be addressed include a lack of access to venture capital funding, and a need to strengthen intellectual property rights.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.35"
"4.233","Educational Disparities","","While average education levels in South Africa have risen since 1994, the majority of students still receive inadequate schooling. According to a 2017 report published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the average math and science scores for South Africa’s 9th grade students were found to be more than two years behind the average for OECD countries - and less than half of all students were able to complete secondary school. The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study published in 2015 ranked 9th grade students in South Africa 38th out of 39 countries surveyed for mathematics, and last for science. In addition, too few South African students are majoring in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects, which involve the sort of problem-solving and critical thinking that will only become more in demand as a result of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. While the South African economy needs more high-skilled workers, the labour force is relatively low-skilled and less-educated. Due to the quality of schooling in the country, people who have attained prestigious degrees are being employed to do things that could have been done by workers with lower levels of education. According to a report published in 2014, so-called Further Education and Training (FET) colleges in South Africa are not producing graduates with relevant skills. A review of the skills in demand in the country is necessary, in order to help FET colleges develop more beneficial curricula. Providing access to quality primary and secondary education for the majority of South Africans is a significant challenge. Only about 20% of the country’s schools are wealthy and able to prepare students for a university education. In lower-quality schools, teacher absenteeism is high, infrastructure is crumbling, and resources are inadequate. A study published in 2016 by Stellenbosch University showed that 73.1% of white students complete a college degree, compared with 53.5% of black students; this reflects the legacy of apartheid. The affordability of higher education has also become a major issue. According to estimates published by the newspaper City Press in 2015, it costs the equivalent of about $7,000 to finance a year at university, in a country where household disposable income per capita was less than $9,000 as of 2014.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.119"
"4.234","Elder Caregiving","","As older populations expand faster than younger populations, it is disrupting traditional social structures where younger family members have had primary responsibility for caring for their elders - and creating more dependence on hospitals and institutions. The gap between the need for elder caregiving and existing supply is widening; by 2060, there will be only one caregiver in Europe for every 51 people aged 80 or older, according to a European Commission projection. As elder caregiving needs increase, a so-called “caring economy” is emerging. It is having a significant impact on the workforce, as it leads to increased absenteeism and decreased productivity, hinders gender parity efforts by having a disproportionately negative effect on female employees (as women make up the majority of elder caregivers), and slows overall economic growth. Working caregivers must often take time off, pass up promotion, or leave the workforce altogether. Meanwhile employers are losing valuable talent, and greater pressure is being placed on social systems. Other impacts: decreased earning and purchasing power; and negative effects on caregivers’ health and well-being, which in turn further drives up overall healthcare costs, according to the Global Coalition on Aging’s 2016 report The Value of Home Care. The need to provision quality care for the elderly is already disrupting national economies. Countries in Europe and North America, as well as Japan and the Republic of Korea, are looking to implement significant reforms in order to meet the needs of ageing populations. In addition, as emerging economies such as Brazil, China, Turkey, and South Africa grow older at a faster rate than they become wealthier, the socio-economic impact of elderly care in those countries could be particularly devastating. New solutions are essential. Greater prominence for the home care industry, for example, could help alleviate the impact of health and social care costs on public budgets. The industry in turn can spur economic growth, and provide employment opportunities for women and minorities, according to Caring in America, a 2011 report from the Paraprofessional Healthcare Institute. In addition, in order to sufficiently adapt to the new realities of ageing, incentives for saving for long-term care, more training and education for elder caregivers, and the application of innovative technologies will all be critical.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.7"
"4.235","Electricity Decentralization","","Distributed energy resources such as solar photovoltaics (PV) that turn light into power, energy storage units, electric vehicles, and microgrids are transforming electricity systems. While these resources still play a relatively minor role in the provision of electricity services, their deployment is increasing and their impact is being felt. Germany’s power system is one of the most striking examples of decentralization; 98% of the country’s solar PV resources are connected to the distribution grid there, according to a report published in 2017 by the research organization Fraunhofer, and 85% of this capacity comes from installations that are smaller than 1 megawatt. Meanwhile one in five customers in Hawaii, and one in 10 homes in California, now have a rooftop solar PV system. As of 2016, distributed solar PV accounted for nearly 13% of all US generation capacity additions, according to the US Energy Information Administration. Decentralized power is not always clean, however; the same trends driving the deployment of distributed solar affect other energy sources. Natural gas-powered combined heat and power units and fuel cells, for example, accounted for 8% of all US generation capacity as of 2015, and provided more than three times the capacity of solar in the country, according to GTM Research. Distributed energy storage resources are being used to defer investments in transmission and distribution networks, replace natural gas- and petroleum-fired “peaker” power plants, and reduce customer bills. Decentralization is not limited to the developed world; microgrids and off-grid energy resources are electrifying areas of India and sub-Saharan Africa that centralized utilities cannot reach. Decentralization enables consumers to better express their preferences, improves the production and delivery of power, and brings electricity to communities that are in dire need. However, if not deployed with care, distributed energy resources can result in dramatically increased power system costs, and foster inequality among resource owners and non-owners. In addition, due to the power lost when charging and discharging, energy storage resources may actually increase emissions. This calls for a sound regulatory framework, which includes a system of pricing and charges that accurately reflects the value of consuming or producing power at different times, and locations - and which also changes the way distribution utilities are remunerated, enabling them to take full advantage of distributed energy resources. Organized electricity markets must be reformed, in order to enable these resources to compete effectively and to reflect the new power sector reality.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.44"
"4.236","Electricity System Integration","","There is a global trend towards the integration of national, state, and local electric power systems in order to create supranational or regional electricity entities. These entities are referred to as “pools,” “interconnections,” or “regional markets,” depending on their organization. While decentralized energy resources (any resource connected to a distribution system that is capable of providing electricity services) are becoming increasingly present in power systems, the systems themselves are becoming more interconnected - both physically and in terms of ownership and management structures - across vast territories. The efficient utilization of electricity generation resources that are too large for a single country, as is the case with some hydro projects, or are too intermittent, like large-scale solar or wind farms, is made possible by the creation of regional markets with enough size to exploit economies of scale and dilute intermittency. Regional markets also make it possible to extend the use of natural resources, such as wind or solar, which are abundant in some territories but not others, across larger geographical areas. Regionalization also enables the creation of liquid, efficient markets in individual provinces, states, or countries which would otherwise be too small to sustain effective competition. Power pools in the US, created in the 1970s, were the first regional organizations of this kind, and were later turned into true regional markets. They were followed by the National Electricity Market (NEM) in Australia, the European Internal Electricity Market (IEM), the Regional Electricity Market (Mercado Eléctrico Regional, or MER) in Central America, the Southern Africa Power Pool (SAAP), and others. Some have reached an advanced level of maturity and integration, while others are still at early stages. Regional power trade, and the efficient utilization of large generation projects, require strong, cross-border network interconnections. Regional trade also requires careful market design, and clear rules for transmission investment planning, cost allocation, and congestion management. Markets must be supported by technical, economic, and institutional analyses of both current systems and likely future iterations. The creation of regional markets and the construction of expensive, cross-border interconnectors, which in some cases may deserve the classification “supergrids,” requires significant amounts of political will and the careful assessment of trade-offs; regional electricity markets are usually just one component of wider regional agreements that encompass other economic sectors.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.44"
"4.237","Electrification of the Economy","","In order to hit carbon dioxide emission targets set out in the 2016 Paris climate change agreement, it will be critical to electrify energy uses now powered by fossil fuels. According to a 2017 International Energy Agency (IEA) report, the energy sector could reach carbon neutrality (the elimination of new emissions) by 2060, through a combination of electrification and energy efficiency. Market forces alone will not push related technological development sufficiently, and will have to be complemented by public policy and clear rules. Only a few energy technologies enjoy favourable policy support, such as PV (solar photovoltaics), onshore wind, electric vehicles, and energy storage. Areas with untapped potential include energy efficiency, bioenergy, and carbon capture and storage. Increased financial support is needed in order to build stronger and smarter infrastructure, including transmission technologies. Heating and cooling in buildings, and industrial activity, currently account for approximately 40% of final energy consumption, according to the IEA report. Buildings can therefore play a major role in transforming the global energy system; increased efficiency in terms of heating, cooling, lighting, and materials could substantially ease demand, which would in turn ease the burden on the system as a whole. The electrification of the transport sector could significantly effect the global energy system, though there is still a long way to go for it to have a real impact on the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. Speeding up the electrification of the transport sector, through improved urban planning and increased public transportation, as well as the integration of grid edge technologies, will require major technological development, investment, and policy support. Industrial energy demand is projected to increase by about two-thirds by 2060, according to the IEA report, and particular focus should be placed on strategic sectors such as iron, steel, and chemicals. In addition to introducing electric power into industrial processes whenever possible, many opportunities exist to curb demand growth - such as bolstering manufacturing efficiency, and optimizing locally available resources and materials. Both national and global policies must support energy technology innovation at all stages, from research to commercial deployment, in order to reap the security, environmental, and economic benefits of energy system transformation. Globalization allows for the faster deployment of proven related technologies, and can enable the private sector to build sustainable business models that both boost the electrification of the global energy system, and mitigate climate change.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.44"
"4.238","Emerging Economies","","About 30 countries, including both developed and developing economies, are considering, planning, or actually starting nuclear power programs, while roughly 20 more have expressed a related interest, according to an April 2018 report published by the World Nuclear Association. In total, there are already 447 operational nuclear power reactors in the world, spread across 30 countries, and nuclear continues to gain prominence as a power source; the 392 electrical gigawatts of installed nuclear power as of the end of 2016 was the highest level recorded to date, according to a July 2017 International Atomic Energy Agency report. The same IAEA report indicated that of the 60 nuclear reactors under construction worldwide, more than half were in the rapidly developing countries of Asia - a region that had accounted for 85 of a total of 105 construction starts since 2000. As electricity demand in developing economies is on track to surpass that of industrialized countries, there is a corresponding push to develop new generating options including nuclear, according to the IAEA report. The agency reported that it has sought to strengthen related safety in the wake of the accident at Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in 2011, which was triggered by an earthquake and forced the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people. The transfer of nuclear technology to emerging economies should help to decouple their economic growth from carbon emissions, improve their resource security, and support the economic resilience of energy-exporting countries in particular. Saudi Arabia, for example, plans to build 16 nuclear power reactors in the next 20 to 25 years, at a cost of more than $80 billion, according to the World Nuclear Association, and the United Arab Emirates has accepted a $20 billion bid from a South Korean consortium to build four commercial nuclear power reactors by 2020. However, the implications for the established global nuclear non-proliferation regime will be significant, particularly if mitigating measures are not implemented. Policy-makers must focus on preventing nuclear terrorism, promoting measures to secure high-risk nuclear material, and preventing the illicit trafficking of material. The ability of authorities even in advanced economies to manage related risk has come into question. A Centre for Public Integrity investigation in 2017, for example, showed that the US struggles to maintain appropriate levels of safety at privately-managed nuclear weapons research facilities.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.102"
"4.239","Emerging Market Entrepreneurship","","Emerging and frontier markets are home to significant wealth creation and an expanding middle class, thanks to their capacity to spawn new businesses. But for those businesses to successfully hone in on untapped markets abroad, they need to adapt to unique needs of new customer segments around the world. By leveraging the power of the internet and other digital technologies, entrepreneurs in emerging markets can better understand how to enter new markets that may show promise, but are also different from those in advanced economies. For example, the poorest, so-called ""Bottom of the Pyramid"" markets pose significant challenges including a lack of distribution and energy infrastructure, and underdeveloped institutions - including those institutions tasked with protecting intellectual property and providing product quality certification. In addition, consumers in many emerging economies have specific cultural preferences, and adhere to social norms that may be different from those in more developed nations. Penetrating these markets therefore calls for innovation that can affect affordability and form a good cultural fit. Social impact-driven, entrepreneurial businesses may be more suitable than others for tapping into Bottom of the Pyramid markets in developing countries.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.47"
"4.240","Emerging Markets","","Emerging economies have outstripped their more advanced peers in terms of overall economic growth in recent years, and they present significant market opportunities for insurers. In China, for example, private health insurance premium revenue may more than double between 2015 and 2020, to CNY 5 trillion, according to the consultancy EY; a report published by EY in 2016 noted that the country’s expanding middle class is increasingly demanding high-quality medical services from a strained public health care system. In Mexico, a country of nearly 130 million people, the insurance penetration rate (a measure of the prevalence of insurance in a domestic economy) is only 2.3%, according to a separate report published by EY in 2018; the same report noted that Chile’s penetration rate of 4.2% is the highest in the region. By 2016, emerging markets had already accounted for one fifth of global insurance premiums, according to research published by Swiss Re, compared with just 5% in 2000. In these markets, insurers are addressing a significant need. Only 11% of economic losses stemming from natural catastrophe events in emerging markets were covered by insurance in 2016, according to Swiss Re. The trend of insurers looking increasingly to emerging markets comes as growth opportunities in developed economies become rarer. That will lead to a global balancing for the industry. According to a projection from Munich Re published in 2017, the growth in insurance premiums in emerging markets will almost fully compensate for the relatively more moderate growth being experienced in industrialized countries, and emerging markets’ share of anticipated additional premium volume will jump to 47% by 2025, from 20% in 2016. Emerging markets show particular promise when it comes to so-called microinsurance policies, which are designed for low-income people and can cover everything from illness to agricultural yields. In addition, emerging markets offer opportunities to sell complex corporate risk policies associated with major infrastructure projects. Infrastructure development in emerging markets can also be a good fit for insurers’ investment portfolios. Long term, fixed income instruments tied to such infrastructure projects can match up well with the long-dated liabilities of insurance companies, according to a feature story published by the World Bank in late 2017. However, the story noted, insurance companies still allocate less than 2.5% of their overall assets under management to infrastructure investment, due to an insufficient understanding of related risk.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.82"
"4.241","Emerging Ocean Technologies","","Emerging technologies are changing the way we harvest food, energy, minerals, and data from the ocean. Rapid innovation in marine robotics, artificial intelligence, low-cost sensors, satellite systems, and methods for collecting and analysing data may yet create a cleaner and safer future - though these developments also present potential challenges for ocean health. Ocean mining is one example; portions of the seafloor are rich in gold, platinum, cobalt, and rare-earth elements, though these resources have up until now been out of reach. New, 300-ton mining machines have been developed that can harvest minerals in some of the deepest parts of the sea. Japan has completed its first large-scale mineral extraction from the seabed, and plans to begin commercial mining in its waters within the next decade. Meanwhile on the high seas, the Jamaica-based International Seabed Authority has issued more than 1 million square kilometres of mining exploration claims to 20 different countries. However, much of the seabed within these claims remains unexplored, and new species are frequently being discovered in the vicinity. It remains unclear if and how sediment plumes from seabed mining will affect the health of oceans generally, and fisheries specifically. Finding a way to properly balance mining interests against potential impacts on ocean ecosystems and marine industries remains a challenge. A revolution in our ability to collect and process ocean data has now enabled the detection of illegal fishing from space, empowered sustainability-focused companies to more efficiently connect with people, and helped build intelligent zoning plans that better balance the needs of fishermen, marine transportation, and ocean conservation. In addition, new technologies are being developed to plug into the ocean’s enormous stores of green energy (possibilities include wave energy, tidal energy, thermal energy, and offshore wind). A record 4,331 megawatts of new offshore wind power was installed around the world during 2017, according to the Global Wind Energy Council, which increased the size of the market by 95%. While remaining hurdles to harvesting ocean energy include cost efficiency and the potential impact of new ocean power plants on ocean life, other exciting innovations are on the way: a robot that swims like a tuna, underwater data centres, autonomous self-driving ships, and geodesic spheres that can serve as offshore fish farms, for example. Properly embraced, disruptive technologies can help us take more from the oceans while damaging them less.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.103"
"4.242","Emerging Technological Risks","","Emerging threats like cyber-terrorism and other cybercrime are both complex, and offer limited amounts of related historical data - which can in turn create challenges for insurance companies aiming to accurately price related risk. The World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Report published in 2018 listed cyberattacks among the top ten risks in terms of both likelihood and impact; related incidents noted in the report include the WannaCry attack, which affected 300,000 computers in 150 countries in 2017. A number of insurers are writing related policies, and cyber insurance premiums probably totalled between $2.5 billion and $3.5 billion in 2016 - and may reach $14 billion by 2022 - according to Swiss Re’s annual global insurance review and outlook published in 2017. One factor driving the purchase of cyber insurance is the General Data Protection Regulation, which is being implemented in Europe in 2018 and is spurring improvements in cyber risk management more generally, according to Swiss Re, which estimated that as of only a few months prior to the regulation’s enforcement just one in ten firms believed they were fully compliant. One area of the insurance industry particularly exposed to both technological risks and opportunities is the motor insurance market, according to an article published by insurance broking and advisory service Willis Towers Watson in 2017. Over the course of about 15 years, the article noted, roughly 10% of American drivers agreed to provide personal data about their driving (in order to receive a cheaper motor insurance policy) - in turn bolstering the marketing, underwriting and pricing of so-called usage-based insurance, which can tie costs to specific use of a car. According to the article, the downside for insurers in adopting this approach is the need to efficiently sort through the ever-expanding volumes of data that it generates. Health insurance may also potentially undergo significant change as a result of related technology developments; some insurers have developed online communities where customers can access resources, and wearable devices are providing a growing stream of real-time data that can help health insurers personalize offerings. In addition, technology developments have spurred a proliferation of “insuretech” startups - investors put $167 million into the sector during the third quarter of 2016 alone, according to Dow Jones Venturesource.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.82"
"4.243","Emerging Technologies","","Cutting-edge technologies, like observation satellites and artificial intelligence, are enabling the real-time monitoring of global forest change. The increasing availability and resolution of satellite imagery are resulting in more (and more detailed) pictures, while advanced algorithms are able to quickly process these images in order to detect changes with enough accuracy to inform local forest management. Advancements in parallel processing, or the division of computer programming among multiple processors, enable these algorithms to be run increasingly cost-effectively, making the continuous monitoring of changes around the globe possible. Meanwhile breakthroughs in data visualization are enabling decision-makers and other non-scientific users to easily access related information, and to act on it. Increasing internet connectivity, and the proliferation of mobile technology, have also improved the ability to alert law enforcement or local communities about illegal logging or burning taking place in protected forests or moratorium areas. Other technologies are facilitating timber tracking and the tracing of wood products from forest to consumer, while anatomical analyses and other methods are enabling the identification of the species and origin of wood being used in supply chains, in order to bolster accountability. Technological developments are also addressing challenges in terms of interpreting data - for example, when it comes to identifying statistically significant hotspots for forest change, or quickly identifying changes occurring within important forest areas. Artificial intelligence is augmenting the examination of forest change, by helping to better predict where change may occur in the future. A significant amount of innovation is being made possible through open data policies and initiatives related to satellite imagery, such as NASA’s Landsat program, which has been amassing millions of images for research and applications, NASA’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) monitoring, used to measure everything from cloud cover to photosynthesis, and the European Space Agency’s Sentinel systems. Radar satellites launched in the recent past can even enable change detection through clouds and smoke, which have presented a significant challenge for tropical forest monitoring in the past. High-resolution satellites developed by private companies including Planet, DigitalGlobe, and others should enable the monitoring of the earth’s surface in incredible detail, and at high frequency, providing daily, high-resolution coverage for the first time. In order to properly analyse the massive volume of resulting data, increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence will be crucial.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.54"
"4.244","Emerging and Frontier Capital Markets","","Development projects in emerging and frontier markets face unique, fundamental challenges that tend to limit the funding made available by the private sector for necessary financing - such as local currency volatility, frequently soft sovereign credit ratings, a lack of investment guarantees, limited local liquidity, and uneven access to affordable capital. This means that projects that should be more attractive may not be financed, and has contributed to a widely shared shortage of necessary investment. In Nigeria, for example, there is currently a $221 billion gap between what the country should be investing in infrastructure between 2007 and 2040, and what is currently being invested, according to the Global Infrastructure Hub, an organization started by the G20; the gap for Egypt is $230 billion, while for Bangladesh it is $192 billion. Blended Finance, an increasingly popular funding mechanism, can alleviate some of the constraints placed on development projects in developing markets by allocating risk to individual investors based on their respective ability to manage it. This reduces the dependence on sovereign guarantees, which can elevate a country’s debt-to-GDP ratio, and helps provide additional capital and liquidity to local markets. As debt levels and budget deficits have risen in developing economies, the use of Blended Finance to access new capital sources can help alleviate rising borrowing costs, and facilitate investments that demonstrate the viability of developing markets for the private investment community. One particular area that could benefit from Blended Finance is the so-called pay-as-you-go sector, which uses mobile financial technology to help people with cell phones in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa gain access to clean and efficient energy, according to a brief published in 2018 by the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor. More than 160 Blended Finance facilities have been launched since 2000, and about $81 billion was mobilized from the private sector by utilizing Blended Finance between 2012 and 2015, according to the brief.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.23"
"4.245","Emissions and Pollution","","The biggest factor shaping the future of transportation is related to carbon dioxide and nitrogen dioxide emissions, and related impacts on climate change and urban pollution. A typical passenger vehicle emits roughly 4.7 metric tons of carbon dioxide a year, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency, while the World Health Organization estimates that 3 million people are killed annually by outdoor air pollution. Another way to measure of the effects of transportation on the environment is through “bio capacities,” or the ability of a natural area to generate resources while absorbing waste; by 2050, urban mobility systems will use five times more of the planet’s bio capacities than they did in 1990, according to a 2014 report published by the International Association of Public Transport (UITP). A significant amount of emissions related to cars and transport is being generated in emerging markets; about 80% of the projected increase in road transport carbon dioxide emissions between 2015 and 2030 is expected to come from countries that have not gained admittance to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, according to the UITP’s report. Already, nearly one quarter of global carbon dioxide emissions from fuel combustion are generated by transport (as opposed to electricity and heat, or industry), according to a report published by the International Energy Agency in 2017, and three quarters of transport emissions come from the road sector. Reducing emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide from exhausts could help to build a more sustainable model for safe, clean and affordable mobility that can support the needs of a growing population. However, related regulatory systems are highly fragmented, particularly at the level of city government, driving up complexity and related costs.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.15"
"4.246","Employment and Employability in Sri Lanka","","According to the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report 2017-2018, Sri Lanka is relatively weak compared with economies at similar stages of development when it comes to labour market efficiency and technological readiness. The state of Sri Lanka’s labour market is holding back economic growth; inefficiencies are preventing the creation of good jobs, and marginalizing women and young people. Archaic labour laws, social security linked to employment, and resistance from unions have prevented the government from restructuring the market to enable more flexibility in the form of merit-based promotions and raises, and mobility between jobs. The country’s informal, or unregulated, economy remains large; it accounted for about 60% of the total workforce as of 2015, according to the annual Labour Force Survey published by the Department of Census and Statistics. Meanwhile demographic changes are slowing the growth of the labour force, as the population both shrinks in size and ages. Many people are simply leaving the country for foreign employment, creating domestic shortages of both low- and high-skilled workers, and hindering economic expansion. Sri Lanka needs to increase labour force participation and productivity. Participation is traditionally low for women and young people, due in part to discrepancies in terms of access to quality education. Remittances from abroad have also contributed to lower labour force participation, by increasing the lowest wage for which a potential worker is willing to take a job. Limited access to tertiary (university or vocational) education, and poor quality of education, have reduced the employability of workers; many with tertiary-level education are either under-employed or are absent entirely from the labour market. Sri Lanka’s government has recognized the need to improve the quality of education generally, and to expand tertiary education - but reforms in terms of enhancing the stock of available teachers and establishing more private universities in the country are taking shape very slowly. Sri Lanka ranked 78th out of 137 economies in terms of higher education and training in the Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report 2017-2018 - due to particularly pressing issues such as low tertiary education enrolment and a low level of internet access in schools generally.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.121"
"4.247","Employment and Wages","","After 1994, legislation was introduced in South Africa to counteract discrimination in the labour market, and to better protect the rights of workers. This initially focused on securing workers’ constitutional rights to unionize and strike, and on establishing basic standards - for example, collective bargaining and a constitutional right to strike. In 1997, minimum work conditions were established, and after 1999 minimum wages were established in certain sectors (followed later by a national minimum wage). The unemployment rate reached 27.2% as of mid-2018, while the unemployment rate for those between 15- and 24-years-old was 31.6%. Evidence suggests that labour laws in South Africa are not particularly strict in comparison to international laws. Labour market policy debates in the country should therefore be about nuance, rather than substantial change. In addition, non-compliance with existing labour legislation is widespread, as many workers earn sub-minimum wages, and do not receive the benefits to which they are legally entitled; current legislation therefore exists in theory, but not always in practice. Simply applying stricter legislation could have detrimental effects on job creation. An important piece of legislation in this regard is the national minimum wage, passed by parliament in May 2018 and setting a rate of R20 (about $1.40) per hour for all workers, regardless of age - which supersedes existing, sector-based minimum wages. Available research suggests that this will result in at least some job losses in the short term, though any impacts are contingent upon the extent to which the legislation is enforced. However, even in the case of limited enforcement, there are concerns about employment effects in an environment of low growth and high unemployment, particularly for specific groups such as young people. A recent policy intervention that aims to tackle the inordinately high level of youth unemployment in South Africa is the Employment Tax Incentive (ETI), informally known as the youth wage subsidy. It was signed into law in 2013, to offset the costs of hiring young and typically inexperienced workers. The scheme functions as a two-year tax incentive for firms that hire these workers, and when compared with other job-creation programs in the country, it is extremely cost-effective. It is also the only demand-side policy mechanism that aims to absorb excess labour supply. Evidence from the national tax database suggests that the ETI is having positive effects.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.119"
"4.248","Empowered Consumers","","People can now instantly compare prices, review products, and share information on social networks about prospective purchases using their mobile phones. Mobile broadband prices have declined sharply during the past three years, while the number of mobile-broadband subscriptions has increased by more than 20% over the past five years, according to a 2017 report published by the International Telecommunications Union. Companies must now accommodate more digitally literate consumers, while also managing misinformation about their brands that can occasionally spread online. Advances in technology have led to increased scrutiny for the food and beverage industry. Companies are under greater pressure to establish responsible and traceable processes, and to share them openly with the public. Legislation has been crafted to enforce requirements related to consumers’ right to information, including a labelling requirement for genetically-modified ingredients passed in the US in 2016, and a European Union regulation on the provision of food information (including through labelling and advertising) to consumers, which went into effect that same year. In 2018, the European Commission adopted new rules on the labelling of primary ingredients in food, which require that the origin of primary ingredients must be indicated if different from the origin of the food itself, in order to not deceive consumers. The new rules are expected to go into effect in 2020.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.9"
"4.249","Encompassing Innovation","","The Republic of Korea’s (South Korea’s) economic development was historically fuelled by prioritising export-oriented industries like information technology, automobile making and ship building. But due to intensifying competition from emerging economies, Korean products that once dominated the global market have rapidly lost their competitive edge. Under pressure to revitalise and diversify the economy by reducing its current over-reliance on a handful of large conglomerates, the country’s political leaders have sought to foster entrepreneurship and innovation. The country’s leadership has embraced the Fourth Industrial Revolution; President Moon Jae-in established a presidential committee on the Fourth Industrial Revolution in October 2017, and has pursued related educational and labour reforms. President Moon has also singled out the development of “smart cities” as a priority for investment.   According to data from the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, the Republic of Korea’s expenditure on research and development as a percentage of GDP was among the highest in the world as of 2015, at 4.2%, just behind Israel’s 4.3% but well ahead of the 2.8% in the US.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.113"
"4.250","Energy Access","","Ensuring access to energy is a moral imperative. Nearly half of the global population is affected by energy poverty, and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals established in 2015 make energy access a priority. The roughly 1 billion people without access to reliable, modern electricity and the roughly 3 billion people who lack access to clean, safe cooking fuels need more help to escape from poverty. Enabling access to clean energy is also a climate imperative; global emissions must peak before 2030, even as energy access is dramatically accelerated in the developing world. And, clean energy access is an element of energy security - because a lack of access functions like a threat multiplier. In 2017, access to electricity in sub-Saharan Africa expanded faster than population growth for the first time in history; however, a continued lack of access to clean cooking fuels contributed to more than 4 million premature deaths during that same year. Still, overall progress has been made in expanding energy access via sustainable sources - wind and solar accounted for more than half of all capacity additions in emerging markets for the first time ever in 2017, according to BloombergNEF’s report Climatescope 2018. There is a massive urban-rural divide in terms of access to energy for cooking and electricity. Nearly 87% of the people in the world going without electricity live in rural areas, according to a report published by the International Renewable Energy Agency in 2018. Working towards ensuring universal access is an enormous wealth creation opportunity. Mini- and micro-grid companies like Powerhive, Mera Gao, and Husk Power Systems have raised hundreds of millions of dollars in private funding, and companies with business models that rely in part on expanding power access like Facebook and Microsoft are investing in related initiatives. In total, foreign direct investment aimed at supporting clean energy in emerging markets rose to $21.4 billion in 2017, from $13.9 billion the previous year, according to the Climatescope 2018 report. While efforts to expand access have historically been made through extensions of centralized systems, this is changing - as the number of decentralized solar home systems, solar irrigation systems, and microgrids in use expands.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.59"
"4.251","Energy Crisis","","Pakistan’s economy has been hindered by an energy crisis for more than a decade. Power outages have affected manufacturing, in particular, which in turn has led to a loss of potential GDP expansion. However, some improvements have been made; power generation capacity increased to 29,573 megawatts by 2018, up from 22,812 megawatts as of 2013. In addition, energy projects with a cumulative capacity of 17,045 megawatts are in the pipeline, as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (an element of China’s massive Belt and Road infrastructure initiative). In addition to shortages faced due to generation capacity issues, structural issues have also haunted the power sector. Still, on average, the sector’s rate of recovery of costs through billing improved to 91.2% between 2014 and 2018, from 85.6% between 2009 and 2013. The system’s reliance on expensive fuels has also declined; oil consumption in the power sector declined to 33% in 2018 from 43% in 2014, for example, as oil is replaced by gas, and as the use of renewable energy powering the system has increased to 2% from nearly zero (there has been a similar increase in the use of nuclear energy). While the energy sector is one of the major contributors of greenhouse gas emissions within Pakistan, the country accounts for just about 0.8% of global emissions - and cleaner domestic energy production is being actively encouraged. The State Bank of Pakistan introduced a refinancing scheme for renewable energy in 2016, for example, which seeks to promote the better utilization of alternative energy sources like solar, wind, and biogas. The central bank has also approved funding for 18 renewable energy projects with a cumulative generation capacity of 618 megawatts. Commercial banks have also contributed, through investment in sustainable agriculture and solar power infrastructure. Tax exemptions are also being granted to promote renewable energy consumption. In terms of oil, more foreign direct investment in exploration is necessary; Pakistan can meet only 15% of its oil demand with domestic sources, and importing the rest weighs on the federal budget. If new sources are not discovered, reserves will become stressed. One way for Pakistan to help ensure access to cheaper gas resources in Central Asia would be to actively help restore peace in neighbouring Afghanistan.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.105"
"4.252","Energy Directions","","In 2015, the United Kingdom announced plans to close all of its coal-fired power plants and shift its energy mix to gas, renewables, and nuclear by 2025. However, the UK’s dependence on energy imports has grown over the years, from 20.5% of the total as of 2007, to 37.4% by 2015, according to Eurostat figures - which adds a significant twist to the country’s 2016 Brexit vote, and its related need to now refashion its international trade relationships. The World Energy Council ranked the UK 5th in its 2017 World Energy Trilemma Index, and cited challenges including the possibility that an exit from the EU single market could significantly increase its energy import costs. While the index cited the UK’s increased electricity generation from renewables as a positive, it also noted that the increase has not fully matched the decline in generation from conventional sources. In one potentially encouraging sign for the country’s energy future, the UK managed to go for more than three days without using any coal-fired power in April 2018; that marked a new record, and was the longest such stretch since the 1880s, according to the National Grid. The UK ranked among leading countries in terms of improvements in carbon emissions and general readiness to transition to a more sustainable, reliable, and affordable energy system in the World Economic Forum’s Energy Transition Index published in 2018 (the UK ranked 7th in the index overall). On aggregate, Brexit (which is expected to occur in 2019) should have a limited energy system-related impact on the European Union, according to a 2017 study published by the European Parliament. The study also noted that as a member of the World Trade Organization, the UK should be able to continue to import and export its own energy to and from other WTO members free of tariffs. However, the study also noted a number of potential downsides, including a possible Brexit effect on the energy system in Ireland, which operates a joint electricity market with Northern Ireland - a country that sits within the UK - while buying a significant amount of gas from Britain. A worst-case scenario would have the UK, including Northern Ireland, drop out of the EU’s internal energy market while Ireland remains, according to the study.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.129"
"4.253","Energy Efficiency and Mobility","","Transportation accounts for 23% of global carbon dioxide emissions, a figure that is expected to nearly double by 2050 if policy-makers continue to prioritize speed over accessible, compact and connected development, according to a paper published by the LSE Cities centre at the London School of Economics in 2019. In response, transportation systems are rapidly changing - thanks to the application of energy-efficient technologies to engines and fuels, and the general adoption of more sustainable behaviour and less-energy-intensive modes of transportation (such as ride sharing). Many governments have meanwhile succeeded in shifting spending away from road-building and maintenance to public transportation. In Colombia, for example, Bogota has developed a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system that has won plaudits, while also paving hundreds of kilometres of new bicycle paths and closing many roads to cars on Sundays. Meanwhile legacy private transportation is frequently being optimized by technology; in 2018, DHL announced it was deploying an Internet of Things-based system in India to optimize trucking routes and potentially cut transit times by 50%. New rules and regulations can help maintain positive momentum, by mandating the further reduction of carbon footprints and limiting more energy use where possible. Mandatory energy efficiency regulation had already been applied to as much as 30% of global consumption by 2015, according to the International Energy Agency’s World Energy Outlook report. Those legal safeguards are necessary, as global energy use is expected to grow by 48% between 2012 and 2040, according to the US Energy Information Administration (one positive aspect of this growth is that the amount of energy spent on the transportation of people and goods is expected to remain constant over the period, accounting for about 19% of total demand). Particularly in non-Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, which are home to 80% of the world’s population and 61% of global transportation consumption, there is tremendous potential to implement smarter and more efficient means of mobility - through emerging technology, new business models, increased consumer literacy, and informed regulation.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.62"
"4.254","Energy Finance and Investment","","Stabilizing global greenhouse gas emissions, meeting future energy demand, and increasing access to reliable electricity will all require substantial additional private investment. The International Energy Agency has estimated that about $53 trillion in energy-related investment will be necessary between 2014 and 2035 in order to achieve the Paris Agreement’s stated target of limiting warming to less than 2°C above pre-industrial temperatures. However, the 2016 agreement only calls for $100 billion in annual investment over its first five years. Electricity markets will require more renewables in order to achieve the Paris Agreement goals, and electricity infrastructure will have to receive substantial related funding. By some estimates, the power system alone will require roughly $55 trillion to hit the 2°C target. With national budgets generally constrained, private investors will have to play a more prominent role. Creating the right investment environment for them - one that takes into account different risk appetites for different classes of investors - will be key. This is especially true for institutional investors like pension funds, which have historically avoided the clean energy sector. Public policy can help create the right market environment, by setting long-term targets and enacting mechanisms to help hit them. For example, California’s historic legislation passed in 2018 calling for 60% of all of the state’s energy to be renewable by 2030, and 100% to be renewable by 2045, creates a stable financial framework for achieving this. The value of similar mechanisms has been proven in many clean energy markets by helping to drive deployment, increase confidence, and decrease both risk and the cost of capital. Increasing digitalization and transparent access to information could have important effects on financing models for future energy systems. As digital technologies capable of monitoring and predicting the performance of energy infrastructure proliferate, the resulting data will become important elements of attracting financing - and parts of an investment portfolio could become more easily segmented according to risk profile. In addition, the small-scale nature of many clean energy resources (like solar in sub-Saharan Africa, for example) means they can be made widely-available via financing done through a mobile phone.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.59"
"4.255","Energy Geopolitics","","Changes in the global balance between supply and demand for oil and gas promise to impact geopolitics - and, in turn, feed back into energy markets. International efforts to adopt policies aimed at mitigating the use of fossil fuels, for example, create geopolitical challenges not only for oil- and gas-rich countries, but also for developing economies where energy demand will continue to grow alongside increasing industrialization. In addition, the ongoing global push for greener energy systems impacts the geopolitical calculations of countries aiming to become significant exporters of things like solar panels, wind turbines, and the lithium and cobalt used to make batteries that power electric cars. This may lead to trade conflicts, the application of tariffs, and more aggressive pushes to exploit raw materials. Another geopolitical fact of life related to oil and gas: as reserves and production grow in North America, so does the ability of the US to check the geopolitical power of countries in other regions that rely on oil and gas exports. The Vienna Alliance (also known as “OPEC+”) between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia is intended to coordinate production and stabilize the price of oil at a level deemed acceptable by exporting nations; OPEC’s inability to control prices by itself can be attributed to the growing supply of oil from the US. Rapid production growth in the US has also led some to question that country’s future role in the Middle East. A reduced role could open the door for increased engagement by developing countries like China and by large oil and gas exporters such as Russia. In Latin America, meanwhile, lingering political risk has investors keeping a watchful eye on developments in Mexico and Brazil. The collapse of the Venezuelan oil industry will require years of rebuilding to regain the levels of crude production the country’s enormous resources can support. Natural gas also presents new geopolitical challenges and opportunities. Trade in liquefied natural gas is growing, and connecting previously fragmented markets. The globalization of this market has implications for the ability of traditional suppliers to control regional markets - and to benefit from their dominant positions.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.104"
"4.256","Energy Independence","","Many countries are particularly vulnerable to conflict when it comes to their energy needs. Ukraine, for example, is a transit point for Russian natural gas to European nations - though conflict between governments in Kiev and Moscow has disrupted the energy supply in the region, and negatively impacted those countries dependent on imports. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced in December 2014 that his government would halt construction of the South Stream gas pipeline, which would have circumvented Ukraine by bringing Russian gas to Bulgaria under the Black Sea. In response, Bulgaria’s government has since sought to attract investors to build the Belene nuclear power project, which would be the country’s second such power station - highlighting the potentially important role that nuclear energy can play, as nations seek to gain energy independence. Even in the resource-rich Middle East, nuclear can be an attractive option. In March 2018, the United Arab Emirates, which holds 6% of the world’s proven oil reserves, completed the construction of the Arab world’s first nuclear reactor. Constructed with South Korean assistance, the UAE’s reactor illustrates how even energy-exporting nations are demonstrating an eagerness to diversify away from fossil fuels and transition their economies to more sustainable footing. Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter, has announced similar plans; it seeks to build at least 16 nuclear power plants, with American support. That comes despite the country’s immense potential to develop solar energy systems. In addition, Saudi Arabia’s longstanding regional rivalry with Iran, and the Trump administration’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal (which has limited Iran’s ability to enrich uranium, and enabled closer monitoring of its nuclear capabilities) highlight the potential danger of spreading related technology and know-how across borders. Nuclear technology transfer is often irreversible, and the stability of several of the states now adopting it is far from certain. Motives for acquiring it can also change, according to the geopolitical context. In light of increased geopolitical volatility, more innovative approaches to governing related technology transfer are needed, in order to mitigate risk. While speculation has mounted regarding Saudi Arabia’s intention to develop nuclear weapons, according to a report published by the Carnegie Middle East Center in March 2018, the country is unlikely to do so as the potential consequences (including potentially damaging its relationship with the US) would outweigh any benefit.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.102"
"4.257","Energy Reform in Mexico","","Mexico’s oil production has declined sharply in recent years; as of early 2019, production was expected to fall to an average of 1.78 million barrels per day that year, from 3.26 million barrels per day in 2006. Greater investment is required in order to boost production and modernize the state oil company, Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex). As of 2017, Pemex was still providing 16.7% of the country’s federal budget, though that was a sharp decline from 37% in 2005, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography. Also by 2017, private firms were participating in Mexican oil and gas production, and government reforms were focused on renewable energy as a means to increase access to electricity. A 2018 Climatescope study ranked Mexico 8th in the world in terms of clean energy investment opportunities, and within Latin America it ranked 3rd (behind Chile and Brazil). According to a World Energy Council report published in 2016, Mexico had the world’s fourth-largest capacity for geothermal electricity production, and according to a World Economic Forum report published in 2017 it has generally improved its development of sustainable, accessible, and secure energy systems - due in part to the phasing out of fuel subsidies. Mexico’s government energy reforms present an opportunity to boost investment in hydrocarbon production and electricity generation capacity, and to reduce costs in order to improve competitiveness. However, the reform effort has been undermined by excessive bureaucracy, a lack of a healthy corporate culture in the energy sector, and political obstacles. The government’s introduction of a steep, 20% hike in gas prices in January 2017 was an effort to deal with a dramatic imbalance between its tax revenue and its debt obligations - which in turn had been a result of economic shocks including a severely weakened peso, declining domestic oil production, and a rise in energy imports. The gas price increase (and the government’s broader move towards full energy price liberalization) was met with public outrage and violent protests. This unrest was a reflection of the government’s inability to publicly articulate the need for reforms likely to cause discomfort. While the sort of energy subsidies that kept gas prices low for Mexicans can provide short-term economic benefits by improving energy access, numerous studies suggest that they actually have significant downsides - because they serve as a regressive tax on the poor, while disproportionately benefiting higher-income groups.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.96"
"4.258","Energy System Governance","","The global energy system is still governed by institutions like the International Energy Agency, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), and the Energy Charter Treaty, which were created after the oil crises of the 1970s. But the energy world looks very different now. New issues include an intensifying race to further exploit Arctic resources, turbulence in oil markets, an uncertain future for natural gas, the transition to low-carbon energy, and renewed concern about nuclear safety. Too much discussion about international energy is being dominated by the concerns of developed countries, and not enough is about the opportunities for (and threats to) emerging economies - which will have the most influence on driving demand, innovation, and patterns of energy trade and investment in the future. In addition, international energy matters are often being viewed through a country-specific lens that frames energy security as a zero-sum game - which in turn results in the inefficient use of resources, and in missed opportunities to cooperate on energy-related research & development, investment, and commercialization. Many threats to the global energy system have emerged, including climate-related risks for energy infrastructure due to coastal flooding, cyberattacks on increasingly integrated electricity grids, a risk of financial collapse for energy firms, and a risk of restricted access to minerals like cobalt that are essential for new energy technologies. A number of energy-related threats to health, productivity, and equality result from the lack of access to electricity that still plagues roughly 1 billion people, and from the lack of clean cooking fuel affecting another 3 billion; however, this is often overlooked by global governance systems. The changing geopolitics of energy has also re-shaped related risk. The re-emergence of the US as a major oil producer has tilted the balance between OPEC and oil-consuming countries, the emergence of shale oil and gas has created a new dynamic that will shape energy markets for the foreseeable future, and the growing popularity of wind and solar technologies has made China the primary manufacturing centre for renewables (China is also making significant investments in technologies such as storage and power-sector automation). As more economies electrify and become reliant on local, low-carbon energy sources like wind, solar, geothermal, and nuclear power, it will further alter governance and geopolitical systems that were originally designed for fossil-fuel-based energy markets.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.59"
"4.259","Energy Technology and Innovation","","If global warming continues at its current pace, a 1.5°C temperature rise above pre-industrial levels could occur as soon as 2030 - triggering catastrophic drought, floods and poverty, according to a 2018 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. Renewable energy technologies are desperately needed to help address this situation. While the cost of solar energy decreased to $0.37 per watt by 2017, from $79 per watt in 1976, turbine costs have fallen by more than 30% since 2010, and battery costs fell by more than 70% between 2010 and 2016 - all enabled by technological advancements. This has created opportunities in regions without centralized electricity systems; lithium-ion batteries have been deployed to help meet peak demand in places like Australia, for example, providing alternatives to gas “peaker” plants. And while some countries are now revisiting the use of coal, more are discussing phasing coal out completely. Bloomberg NEF has estimated that coal will shrink to 11% of global electricity generation by 2050, from 38% currently. Many countries have also set targets for phasing out fossil-fuel-powered cars. By 2018, about half of the cars being sold in Norway were electric. However, only a small percentage of traditional energy providers’ revenue is now being invested in low-carbon energy alternatives. And there are other potential drawbacks; conventional lithium-ion batteries used in electric cars, for example, contain cobalt - the mining of which has been marred by the use of child labour, and by health and safety hazards. This has prompted interest in finding alternative technologies to reduce or even replace the cobalt used in batteries. Multi-stakeholder initiatives like the World Economic Forum’s Global Battery Alliance provide platforms to address such challenges. While some progress has been made, the adoption of technologies that can help replace fossil fuels must become more widespread. This calls for greater support for research and development in both academia and the private sector. A new workforce has to be trained for the clean energy transition, and augmented by resources like artificial intelligence as it pushes forward on scientific discovery.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.59"
"4.260","Energy Transition","","The German “Energiewende,” or the country’s policy of transitioning to more renewable energy sources, has raised concerns about related costs for households and industry. The security of the energy supply must be maintained at a high level, as more energy production relies upon renewable sources; the Energiewende program aims for 80% of electricity produced by 2050 to be derived from renewable sources. According to the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems, about 38% of the German energy supply came from renewable sources as of 2017. The portion of nuclear power in Germany’s energy mix declined to 14.1% in 2015, from 28% as of 2003, according to the Energy Transition project run by the Heinrich Böll Foundation. According to the same source, Germany was a net exporter of electricity in 2015, with export amounts similar to those of France. A 2016 report on the quality of the energy and gas supply published by the Council of European Energy Regulators noted that Germany enjoys reliable security of its energy supply, with low levels of unplanned interruptions - only about 25 minutes were lost during all of 2014. This comes at a high cost for customers, as there are a growing number of charges and taxes added to energy bills. One reason for this is related to infrastructure. While energy was traditionally produced close to consumption areas, most of Germany's new renewable power (particularly wind power) is generated in less densely populated, and remote coastal areas and in the east of the country; this energy surplus must then be transported to industrial areas in the southwest. Planning and permitting procedures for a new power line can easily take eight to ten years, or more, in Germany. The growing prominence of renewable energy in the market can lead to a mismatch between the physical needs of the system and the profitability of power plants. It is questionable whether the current system allows for sufficient incentives for investment in production capacities that are flexible enough to balance the fluctuations of renewable energy. In addition, the more renewable energy produced at almost zero cost, the less profitable the production of gas power plants becomes.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.66"
"4.261","Energy and Water","","Traditional energy production based on fossil fuels and nuclear power requires large volumes of water. On the other hand, the heating, transport, purification, and use of water consume vast amounts of energy. Policies that successfully account for both energy and water use can therefore potentially produce multiple benefits. An urban water conservation mandate implemented during a period of drought in California, for example, which mandated a 25% reduction in water use, resulted in electricity savings that were 11% greater than what was achieved by dedicated electric utility efficiency programs during the same period - while resulting greenhouse gas emission reductions that were equivalent to removing 111,000 cars from the road for a full year. The fossil fuel economy is particularly water-intensive and polluting. The waste products generated by burning coal send toxic heavy metals into groundwater and rivers. Recently, water demand for fracking in the US has soared, increasing by as much as 770% per well between 2011 and 2016 in the Permian Basin; that level of demand can severely limit local freshwater availability. Thermal power plants account for more water withdrawals (used for cooling) than any other sector in the US, though much of that water is eventually returned - at a warmer temperature - to rivers and lakes. These energy systems rely on consistency in terms of river flow and temperature, and severe drought in France and in the southern US have resulted in power plant deratings or shutdowns as water temperatures have become too high. Some alternative energy options also have drawbacks; ethanol-based biofuels require land and water to grow corn, switchgrass, and other feedstocks, for example. The reservoirs associated with hydropower dams in arid regions are losing substantial amounts of water to evaporation, while dams in tropical regions are generating methane emissions. In terms of water treatment and purification energy use, Saudi Arabia, by some estimates, dedicates 10% of domestic oil consumption to desalinating water - while in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, desalination accounts for roughly 30% of electricity use. By way of contrast, wind turbines and solar panels require little to no water to produce electricity. Energy choices and solutions can have serious consequences for water availability - and need to be tailored to specific challenges that vary by region. Even those policies designed to mitigate climate change can potentially exacerbate water scarcity.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.134"
"4.262","Energy, Water and the Environment","","Chile’s economic development over the past two decades has relied heavily on the country’s raw materials and natural resources. Chile is the world’s top producer and exporter of copper, while agriculture, forestry and fisheries are also important contributors. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) 2016 Environmental Performance Review, Chile’s economic structure and resource-intensive growth has exacerbated environmental issues like air pollution, water shortages, habitat loss and water contamination. The report also highlighted Chile’s vulnerability to impacts of climate change such as declining water availability, extreme weather events, worsening water quality and extreme heat. Government efforts to address these issues include the creation of a national system to monitor greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, regional adaptation plans, and measures to achieve the country’s 2015 Paris Agreement commitments (including a 30% reduction of GHG emissions by 2030). In addition, a long-term strategy (through 2050) for water resource security is being developed. Between 1990 and 2010, GHG emissions in Chile increased by 83.5%, according to government data. 34% of energy-related emissions were tied to electricity generation, 30.5% to transportation, and 18.1% to manufacturing and construction. The development of Chile’s power supply has been instrumental in enabling the country’s extraordinary economic growth. However, its energy mix poses environmental challenges, and is conducive to high electricity prices that impact national productivity - something that both past and present governments have acknowledged. In 2015, Chile’s National Energy Commission estimated that electricity demand would increase by 3.72% annually until 2030, pointing to a need to expand short-term and medium-term energy generation projects. Chile not only needs more energy, that energy needs it to be cheaper, cleaner and more efficient. Government efforts have been made to promote renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and biomass, which now represent 15% of the country’s energy mix; that is projected to reach 70% by 2050. The Ministry of Energy is carrying out power auctions that allow all types of renewable energy firms to bid for specific hourly blocks of providing electricity to the country - a structure that helps providers of renewable sources compete. The country also recently passed a so-called carbon tax. According to the European Solar Thermal Electricity Association, in 2016 solar power was sold in Chile at the lowest price ever recorded at that time: $29 per megawatt-hour. However, fossil fuels and hydropower will also continue to be important components of the country’s energy mix, which calls for high efficiency and environmental standards for these sources. Chile’s water resource availability varies greatly between the north of the country, which has less than 1,000 millimetres of rainfall per person a year, and the south, which enjoys more than 10,000 millimetres per person a year. Underground water availability is ample, but less accurately measured, and prices for water rights vary greatly among regions. Agriculture accounts for 81% of the water use in the country, and the remainder is distributed about evenly among domestic, industrial and mining uses. Chile is among the top 30 countries in the world that face water security risks tied to climate change, based on a 2015 technical note from the World Resources Institute. Already, extreme weather events that produce flooding in cities and affect public services have increased greatly in the country during the past decade. Design policies are being studied that could help adapt to this risk, such as building additional desalination plants and water reuse facilities.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.29"
"4.263","Energy-Related Emission Reduction","","The energy consumption required to support human activity is responsible for about three quarters of the world’s greenhouse emissions, which are in turn causing climate change. Energy demand grows alongside population growth, and alongside increasing standards of living; improvements in energy efficiency meanwhile act as a counterbalance. The portion of global energy demand served by electricity is already substantial, and expanding further. There is therefore a clear need to decarbonize the electric power sector itself, in order to help guarantee the sustainability of human development. How and when this is achieved will have important implications for the broader process of decarbonizing the global economy. There are good reasons to prioritize the decarbonization of electricity over other energy carriers, such as hydrogen; electricity can be more easily decarbonized, for example, and it can be produced in many different ways with low associated emissions of greenhouse gases. It is technically viable, and economically affordable, to produce electricity from renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, geothermal, hydro, and biomass. Nuclear generation of electricity is another proven and powerful alternative - though it is often associated with problems like nuclear proliferation, nuclear waste, and accidents. Electricity is wonderfully versatile, and can replace the utilization of fossil fuels in numerous areas. Mobility is one promising example - in the form of electric vehicles including light road vehicles, and railways. Cooling or heating buildings, with the use of heat pumps, is another. Other trends, such as decentralization and digitalization, may have a significant influence on decarbonization. Disruptive advances in storage technologies such as batteries may be a key factor in full electricity decarbonization, for example, as they can mitigate the intermittency effects of some renewable energy production resources. However, the extent to which storage technologies will be required in decarbonized power systems is an area of active research. The decarbonization of economies is a global endeavour. Countries must collaborate, particularly the three that make the largest collective contribution to greenhouse gas emissions: the US, China, and India. Far-sighted policy measures, developed with adequate regulatory approaches, will be essential to guide market forces and private investment towards decarbonization, while innovative business models can contribute to this transformation process.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.44"
"4.264","Enhanced Bodies","","Ageing, accidents, and illness might diminish physical capability, but emerging technologies are improving restorative and therapeutic interventions. For example, exoskeletal suits have been developed that enable paralysed patients to be mobile again; companies including US-based SuitX are now offering robotic exoskeletons which can enable people with spinal cord injuries to move around and enjoy an improved quality of life, but which also cost tens of thousands of dollars. However, as the technology powering solutions such as bionic legs that can be used following amputation to enable greater physical ability improves, that could have dramatic implications - not least, by raising the possibility of self-induced disability for the purposes of enhancement (in the form of higher endurance, or faster speed). Certain prosthetics have already raised related issues. Blade prostheses, such as those used by South African sprinter Oscar Pistorius, are believed to potentially provide competitive benefits as they weigh less than legs and feet, making them theoretically easier to move faster with less effort, according to an article published in Scientific American in 2016 (that belief resulted in the disqualification of Olympic hopeful Markus Rehm, according to the article). As we start to push the boundaries of our natural evolution with such technological add-ons, the monitoring of potential long-term consequences will be crucial. As fully-functioning humans seek to bolster their performance, more products will be made available to them that fall outside of the restorative, medical regime. Exoskeletal suits that enable people to do things like lift extremely heavy objects are already being provided by employers in Japan to increase worker productivity. This raises the possibility of further efforts to increase performance on the job via technologies like novel joint and muscle implants - and the possibility that increasing numbers of people will start to feel it is necessary to undergo such interventions, in order to compete on the job market. Other potential cybernetic enhancements include sensory and wireless activation implants, like RFID tags, which can be implanted in the body and used to open a locked car door - and which have triggered related safety and security concerns about making things like this available to the broader public. If we are to foster the further development of tools that are both restorative and performance enhancing, we need to be mindful of the potential social implications.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.72"
"4.265","Enhanced Genes","","Medical researchers are seeking to eradicate disease in increasingly sophisticated ways, including through human genome editing. Genetic modifications that can potentially be made in order to address neurological and metabolic diseases, and to affect ageing, are of particular interest. However, this raises serious questions about how much we should be interfering with natural human development. For example, scientists are currently developing genetic regenerative medicine that targets age-related muscle loss, also known as sarcopenia - yet, it is not exactly clear whether we should even view sarcopenia as a disease that needs to be treated, or simply as a normal side effect of ageing that we should accept. In addition, while gene therapy used to treat an individual by targeting bone marrow or blood cells cannot then affect that individual’s children, so-called “germline” gene therapy, which involves targeting egg and sperm cells and enables an inserted gene to be passed on to future generations, has proven to be controversial, according to a guide published by the US National Library of Medicine in 2018. In addition to preventive and therapeutic enhancements, non-therapeutic genetic enhancements are also becoming available. As a result, we may become able to select things like eye colour for our babies yet to be born, or our future children’s height or muscle strength. Related ethical questions about selection and discrimination should be considered. In 2017, in the journal Nature, scientists published the results of a procedure where they had successfully used gene editing to rid embryos of a mutation linked to heart disease; that raised questions about the potential impact if, for example, instead of simply eliminating a heritable disease, prospective parents wanted to eliminate undesirable traits like being short, or having an introverted personality. Genome editing for enhancement could potentially worsen social inequality, and create social pressure to make use of related technologies - which in turn could hinder individual freedom and autonomy. Related questions to consider include what alterations that enhance well-being should be made widely available, and whether or not these alterations should not only be applied to individuals, but also to their offspring.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.72"
"4.266","Enhanced Longevity","","The fear of death, and the dream of eternal youth, are both constant. Alongside the increased prevalence of biotechnology and an improved understanding of ageing, new methods are being developed to decelerate the decline of biological processes - resulting in prolonged lives. According to an article published in the medical journal The Lancet in 2017, there is a high probability that life expectancy will continue to increase in all industrialized countries, and a more than 50% chance that by 2030, national female life expectancy in South Korea will surpass 90 years - a level deemed unattainable by some as recently as the turn of the 21st century. However, with a greater possibility for human enhancement, there is also a greater risk of prolonged living with a lower quality of life - and relatively low functional capability. In addition, while only some individuals will truly benefit from longer lifespans, the increased resulting burden on health care systems will be borne by all. In the case of “boundless” life expectancy, where potential medical inventions could conceivably extend our lifespans to around 150 years, the question of how to earn enough money to live off of in old age suddenly becomes very different, as noted in an article published by the Brookings Institution in 2016. Developers of emerging technologies and regulators must explore how people can live well, both physically and mentally, as the enhancement options available to them proliferate - and also how these options can potentially strengthen social connections and general well-being. In addition, better social integration of the growing elderly demographic must be better facilitated, and technologies should be deployed to help the elderly stay connected and as autonomous as possible. Smart homes with sensors that can trigger alerts when medical issues arise are important in this respect, though the importance of human interaction should not be de-emphasized. However, as medical and technology advances are extending longevity for large numbers of people, there is a worsening shortage home health care workers needed to look after them. In the US, for example, the available jobs in the field of direct care workers (including home health aides) is projected to increase by 48% between 2010 and 2020, while the availability of people to fill those jobs is projected to decline, according to a discussion paper published by the National Academy of Medicine in 2016.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.72"
"4.267","Enhanced Minds","","Thanks to scientific and technological progress, it is now possible to enhance human cognitive functions over the course of a lifespan. The brain is the most complex part of the body, and our computational core for processing and interpreting sensory input; while cognitive skills like memory generally start to decline during our 20s, the pace varies from person to person. Advances in understanding the functioning of the brain are enabling novel behavioural, pharmacological, and neuro-technological interventions designed to help preserve cognition. In 2018, scientists from the University of Southern California and Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center published a study in the Journal of Neural Engineering demonstrating the success of implants that sharply improved short-term memory performance. The technology made use of a patient’s existing brain cell code, or pattern for memory, in order to artificially bolster so-called episodic memory, which is useful for recalling practical details such as where you have parked your car. The scientists behind the study noted at the time of publication that they aimed to eventually help people hold on to specific memories such as their home address, even as their overall memory begins to fail. Companies around the world are researching other new ways not only to preserve, but to improve cognition, and to potentially enable us to perform at higher levels for longer periods. Non-invasive brain stimulation, or neural implants, could ultimately help us become more attentive, improve our decision making, and help us think faster; basically, make us smarter. Kernel, a company founded with a $100 million investment in 2016, is attempting to develop ways to augment the human brain by applying the principles of computing; it says it ultimately aims to use technology to interpret the brain’s workings, and create applications for cognitive enhancement. However, there are several related questions that must be addressed - regarding where the limits of such enhancement should be, to what extent cognitive enhancement can be both personally desirable and socially acceptable, and to what extent a decision that is made with the aid of a device should be considered to have been manipulated. In addition, we need to consider to what extent such advances will influence behaviour, alter social cohesion, and create a need to prevent related abuse.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.72"
"4.268","Ensuring a Sustainable UAE","","The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has the world’s seventh-largest proven crude oil reserves, oil remains the biggest component of its energy mix, and the sale of oil accounted for a critical portion of government revenue in 2017. However, strategic efforts to diversify the country’s economy are showing results; it ranked in the top quartile globally in terms of innovation capability in the World Economic Forum’s 2018 Global Competitiveness Index, for example (35th overall, out of 140 economies). Besides being a regional technology and innovation hub, the UAE is emerging as a leader in the Arab world in terms of sustainability. The economic boom that the UAE has experienced over a relatively short, recent period of time has had a significant impact on its natural resources, leading to land degradation, desertification, soil deterioration, and water scarcity issues. The country implemented its first environmental protection legislation in 1999, and it has actively sought to address its environmental challenges, which are likely to be further exacerbated by the impacts of climate change. Recent efforts include the UAE Green Agenda 2030, and the National Climate Change Plan 2017-2050.  The UAE has sought to channel its booming economy into “green growth,” as part of the country’s Vision 2021 National Agenda. Among the most ambitious related initiatives, the government’s Energy Strategy 2050 aims to reduce the national carbon footprint by 70%, and increase the contribution of clean energy to 50% of the total energy mix, by the middle of this century. Already, Abu Dhabi’s Estidama (“sustainability” in Arabic) program involves rating the environmental impact of new buildings, while Dubai’s Green Building Regulation is designed to improve efficiency in the energy consumption of new buildings. In addition, major projects for developing renewable energy capabilities include Abu Dhabi’s Sir Bani Yas wind farm, home to the world’s largest wind turbines, and Dubai’s Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, which is the world’s biggest. Waste production, in particular, remains a significant challenge for the UAE; the rate of production is three times higher here than the global average. In late 2018, the UAE’s Minister of Climate Change and Environment joined the World Economic Forum’s Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy, which could support existing UAE efforts to improve efficiency in waste processing.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.128"
"4.269","Entrepreneurial Leadership","","Successful startups and innovative corporations have demonstrated how to transcend existing leadership methods in a way that creates new ways of functioning as an organization. Startups, for example, often go through multiple iterations of ideation (the process of generating ideas) as they approach a problem, followed by relentless prototyping. The vast majority of these prototypes fail. However, the relatively limited amount of time and resources spent on developing them (including the handful that actually succeed) makes the process not only sustainable, but often highly effective. This ability to move quickly from design to implementation is characteristic of entrepreneurial leadership - which emphasizes mobilizing external resources, pushing through previously-assumed boundaries, and building new business models in the process. These new models, whether they involve crunching big data to pursue criminal probes, or distributing electric scooters throughout a city centre, are a defining feature of the Fourth Industrial Revolution; they have captured public attention through the ways that they disrupt, and the ways that they transmit the influence and impact of individual entrepreneurs. Creating and running an innovative business in the mold of Amazon or Uber requires a greater effort to understand how technology can impact traditional civic and business structures. One particularly appropriate flavour of leadership was described more than half a century ago by anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss in his famous 1962 essay The Savage Mind, as “mythical thought.” Mythical thought, Lévi-Strauss wrote, expresses itself by means of a reliable but limited repertoire of skills and abilities - the person in possession of this repertoire must use it for the task at hand, as nothing else is available. Kevin Systrom, the co-founder of Instagram, illustrates the concept of mythical thought well. Systrom had studied management science and engineering at Stanford University, but was a self-taught programmer when he built Burbn, the product that led to the development of Instagram in 2010. Systrom was savvy enough to be able to use these limited skills (in combination with others) to build something that almost instantly drew millions of users, and was acquired by Facebook for $1 billion in 2012.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.93"
"4.270","Entrepreneurship and Innovation in Argentina","","A number of Latin America’s most successful technology companies have come from Argentina, including the Nasdaq-listed online retailer MercadoLibre and Buenos Aires-based digital marketing software-developer Globant. Some of the active players in Argentina’s startup scene include the venture capital firm KaSZek Ventures, which is focused on Latin America, and Endeavor, an international non-profit organization supporting entrepreneurs. However, the number of new companies being created annually in Argentina has actually declined since 2007, according to a report published by the Inter-American Development Bank. This is generally the result of a lack of access to financing, and of a lack of legal predictability. There are also challenges related to finding workers with the necessary skills. The World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report 2018 ranked Argentina 54th out of 140 countries in terms of innovation capability, and 51st in terms of the skills of its workforce. However, it also ranked 95th in terms of the protection of intellectual property, and 78th in terms of the digital skills of its population. Low levels of private investment into innovation and technical training are factors behind Argentina’s relatively poor “total factor productivity,” a measure of available technology and know-how in a country that can make production more efficient. A shortage of early-stage venture capital funding and regulatory and tax burdens also present major challenges for entrepreneurs. Argentina ranked 128th out of 190 countries in terms of the ease of starting a business in the World Bank report Doing Business 2019. The report noted that the country had made the process easier by introducing an expedited process for limited liability companies - part of a broader government effort to simplify bureaucracy and reduce the number of administrative processes necessary in order to be able to operate locally. Government reform efforts have also included measures intended to simplify legal procedures, speed up public procurement, and increase the focus on digitalization. Buenos Aires is particularly well positioned to become a hub for technology and innovation; the local government there has pioneered effective policies to support entrepreneurs such as co-investment schemes for startups, and incubator programs.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.11"
"4.271","Entrepreneurship for Growth","","Entrepreneurship is the essential fuel for job creation efforts in the Middle East and North Africa region, which has a relatively small, but vibrant startup scene. Notable outcomes for local startups include the sale of Souq, a Dubai-based online retailer, to Amazon for $580 million in early 2017. The region has now witnessed dozens of major “exit events” (a way of describing a sale of, or a public listing of, a young company) for local entrepreneurs since 2000 - that includes Rocket Internet’s acquisition of Kuwait-based food delivery service Talabat for about $170 million in 2015, and Delivery Hero’s purchase of Kuwaiti rival Carriage in 2017 for a reported $100 million. More recently, Samsung Electronics acquired Egyptian artificial intelligence startup Kngine for an undisclosed sum in early 2018. These experiences have helped the local venture capital and angel investment scene to further evolve. The number of startup investors in the Middle East and North Africa region increased by 30% between 2015 and 2017, according to a report published by McKinsey & Company in 2018, while total funding in the region more than doubled during the same period. Across the Middle East, the digital economy’s contribution to GDP remains low compared with other regions of the world, according to McKinsey’s 2018 report; the digital contribution in individual countries ranged from 0.4% in Qatar, to 3.8% in Saudi Arabia, 4.3% in the UAE, and as high as 8% in Bahrain (a figure that was driven by digital exports). Overall, the Middle East’s digital contribution to GDP was 4.1%, according to the report, compared with 6.2% in Europe and 8% in the US. Regional startup hubs such as Amman, Beirut, Cairo, and Dubai are now awash with a diverse array of international and local investors, including 500 Startups, BECO Capital, and Wamda Capital, as well as institutional backers like the European Investment Bank and the International Finance Corporation - which make funds available specifically for entrepreneurs. In addition, corporations, particularly in industries like telecom, have also set up venture capital arms (Zain and Saudi Telecom Company, or STC, have been particularly active). According to the McKinsey report, 14 new, significant corporate venture capital funds appeared in the MENA region between 2015 and 2016.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.97"
"4.272","Environmental Biotechnology","","Metabolic and bioprocess engineering can be used to treat waste water and tackle serious environmental problems - including plastic pollution. The production and incineration of plastic will add more than 850 million metric tons of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere during 2019, equivalent to the pollution caused by 189 coal-fired power plants, according to a report published by the Center for International and Environmental Law. Plastics like polyethylene terephthalate (PET) pervade our daily lives because they are cheap to manufacture and highly durable. This durability causes serious damage; as much as 8.8 million metric tons of plastic waste is estimated to enter the ocean every year, where it will remain indefinitely. Microorganisms, which have mostly been used for the production of chemicals and materials, can also be applied to the biodegradation of plastics in a way that enables a highly-sustainable recycling system. In 2016, a Japanese research team from the Kyoto Institute of Technology and Keio University published a report in the journal Science about a bacterium called Ideonella sakaiensis, which contains an enzyme, PETase, that was found to be able to degrade PET. A Korean research team from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST) and Kyungpook National University further delved into this PET-degrading enzyme and determined its 3D crystal structure, while predicting a molecular mechanism of the PET degradation. They published their research in the journal Nature Communications in 2018 - and the approaches behind it can now be applied to the study of enzymes that could degrade other types of plastics. Recent research on the biodegradation of plastics has created potential for synergy with the sort of microbial production of biodegradable polymers that have long been studied by microbial engineers. Microorganisms can now be engineered to produce polyhydroxyalkanoates (polyesters that can store carbon), polylactic acid (a biodegradable polyester), and, as of recently, aromatic polyesters that use renewable biomass feedstock as raw material. One lingering challenge has been to find a way to improve microbial production performance at an economically viable scale - which will need to be overcome in order to significantly mitigate plastic pollution and establish sustainable plastic recycling.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.22"
"4.273","Environmental Dangers","","The decline and fall of some of the world’s most sophisticated civilizations has been linked to environmental factors, from Mayans succumbing to deforestation and drought to disruptions to Roman food supply networks. In 2018, the World Meteorological Organization reported that the previous five years had been the hottest on record, and a spate of forest fires that devastated parts of California, Greece, Siberia, and even the Arctic in the summer of 2018 were linked to human-induced climate change. The intersection of environmental pressures with an issue like migration can illustrate just how vulnerable modern, globally integrated societies can be to a shock to one of their component parts. Humanity’s ecological impact on the world is increasingly visible and increasingly deadly; while ancient civilizations were largely the victims of environmental forces over which they had no influence, and had few tools to soften their economic and social impact, contemporary societies are both the primary cause of the environmental threats to life on earth and have the scientific and technical know-how required in order to understand and mitigate them. Yet, the global cooperation required to develop necessary solutions remains elusive. From food security to climate change, the spiralling environmental pressures that the world will increasingly face are not being met by system-level policy responses. On the contrary, the world appears more politically fragmented than ever. These trends - the worsening of environmental threats and an increasingly fragmented international community - are causing fragility on a grand scale. The unpredictable and profound nature of environmental pressures will only magnify many existing vulnerabilities. In 2018, changing rainfall patterns sparked an international dispute over the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and forced Iraqi farmers to abandon their land, while in the future, a loss of land mass to rising sea levels may displace millions of people, and the loss of biodiversity could cripple economies and lead to political collapse in fragile states. Hardening geopolitical divisions are both fuelling these systemic risks and preventing work that could be done towards devising collective solutions. In a world of divergent values and visions, the way we manage growing environmental pressures will increasingly depend on our ability to find new and effective forms of cooperation.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.65"
"4.274","Environmental Footprint","","Increased demand for food, due to a rapidly growing global population, will only worsen the negative environmental impact of food systems. Water availability, climate volatility, and deforestation are among the most pressing related issues. While the global population increased by 340% between the years 1900 and 2010, global water withdrawal grew by 630% over the same period, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. In 2018, the Water Resources Group estimated that, under a business-as-usual scenario, global water requirements would increase by 2030 to a level that is 40% above current accessible, reliable supply. Optimizing the efficiency of water use in production and distribution is critical. Climate change will increasingly affect food systems; rising temperatures and shifting rainfall patterns will put crop production at risk, leading to yield losses and higher food prices. A 2013 World Bank report, Turn Down the Heat, argued that 2°C of global warming above preindustrial levels could reduce total crop production by 10% (current temperatures are about 1°C above preindustrial levels), though some crops will be more affected than others - just 1.5°C of warming by the 2030s could result in a 40% loss of areas for growing maize in sub-Saharan Africa, for example. Climate change-related extreme weather events like drought, flooding, and heat waves increase agricultural price volatility, trigger food crises, and disrupt global supply chains. The implications of this are more severe for less-resilient countries; drought in the Horn of Africa in 2011 exposed 13.3 million people in the region to extreme food insecurity, for example, resulting in high levels of malnutrition and a high risk of infectious disease. Agriculture can also be a major driver of land degradation, deforestation, and greenhouse gas emissions. According to a 2016 World Resources Institute working paper, the production of animal-based foods (such as dairy products and meat) was responsible for about two-thirds of production-related greenhouse gas emissions in 2009 (a 2014 study found that halving meat and dairy consumption in Europe could reduce emissions from agriculture by as much as 40%). Meanwhile an estimated one third of all arable land is degraded, due to the overuse of agrochemicals, soil mismanagement, and poor farming techniques, while deforestation has emerged as an issue of growing importance. Industrial agriculture accounted for 80% of the deforestation in tropical and subtropical countries between 2000 and 2010, according to Yale University’s Global Forest Atlas.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.60"
"4.275","Environmental Health and Climate Change","","Nearly one quarter of all global deaths are a result of the environment, according to the World Health Organization’s (WHO) 2016 report Preventing Disease Through Healthy Environments: A Global Assessment of the Burden of Disease from Environmental Risks. One of the greatest environmental threats to human health is air pollution. Many low- and middle-income countries do not monitor air quality, and either lack effective emission control legislation or simply fail to enforce legislation. As a result, their populations face a disproportionate disease burden. In addition to outdoor exposure to air pollution, WHO estimated in 2016 that almost 3 billion people around the world were still burning biomass fuel and coal indoors, in order to cook or to heat their homes, which resulted in more than 4 million deaths annually. In 2018, WHO estimated that more than 80% of people living in urban areas (that monitor air pollution) are exposed to air quality levels that exceed the organization’s limits - and that 97% of cities in low- and middle-income countries with more than 100,000 inhabitants do not meet WHO air quality guidelines (the figure falls to 49% for high-income countries).  Air pollution is also a primary contributor to climate change, which has generated global health risks including changes in vector-borne disease patterns, water scarcity, food insecurity, and violence. These threats are most severe for vulnerable populations like children, the elderly, and the poor. Additional measures are needed in order to reduce exposure to air pollution and mitigate the effects of climate change, and decrease disease rates and mortality. United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, and the Paris Agreement on climate change, have recognized this need and provide goals and targets in order to prioritize action (though one of the world’s biggest sources of carbon emissions and pollution, the US, has announced plans to withdraw from the Paris Agreement). New and expanding research disciplines, including Planetary Health (which takes into consideration all the natural systems that human health depends upon) and the collaborative approach known as One Health, have drawn increased focus to the complex, interconnected relationships between the earth’s natural systems and species. These approaches recognize that the health of humans, animals, and the environment are closely interrelated, and promise to broadly advance our understanding of environmental impacts.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","['1.61', '1.69']"
"4.276","Environmental Preservation","","Drones provide a new tool to help better understand and address the existential threats posed by changes to our environment, whether it’s the mass extinction of large mammals, the acidification of bodies of water, or deforestation. Unmanned aircraft systems are already being employed to monitor sea ice flows in the Arctic, migration patterns of whales and illegal fishing vessels that endanger species in the Atlantic Ocean. However, the same regulatory and social issues that could hinder broad deployment of drones may also impact our ability to use them for environmental protection. Drones can enable high resolution, remote monitoring and data collection across regions and climates at lower cost - and lower risk - than manual methods. While most discussion about drones focuses on aerial applications, their use in water, on land and in space is also important. Deep sea drones, for example, can conduct long-term inspections of oil pipelines that supplant extremely dangerous diving operations and increase inspection frequency. Meanwhile drones can trawl the edges of space, in order to remove debris from an increasingly congested exosphere.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.42"
"4.277","Environmental Remediation","","After decades of heavy industrial development, China’s environmental challenges are nearing a tipping point, which if not corrected in a timely way could inflict significant costs on the country’s social fabric and economy. Throughout the country, worsening air, water, and soil pollution caused by industrialization, vehicle emissions, and power plants threaten to cause serious damage to China’s environmental ecosystem. In response, the government has declared a “war on pollution,” and has taken steps to dismantle coal-fired power plants, reduce emissions levels, and lower particulate-matter emission rates. There has also been a shift in societal awareness, with more public attention being paid to China’s worsening pollution, agricultural conditions, and food safety standards, which has in turn led to more citizens demanding a cleaner environment. The 2015 report Green Finance Reform and Green Transformation, released by the China Council for International Cooperation on Environment and Development, estimated that China will need to invest between RMB 40.3 trillion and RMB 123.4 trillion during the period 2014 to 2030 in order to adequately finance a transition to a greener economy. China is actively seeking ways to diversify its energy consumption away from coal and fossil fuels, to renewables and nuclear. The government’s 13th Five-Year Plan, released in 2016, calls for as much as a 65% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared with 2005 levels. In 2014, the International Energy Agency reported that China was poised to become the global leader in low-carbon technology deployment. According to the US Energy Information Administration’s International Energy Outlook 2016, Chinese coal consumption will decline between 2016 and 2040 as demand decreases. The Five-Year Plan acknowledges the Fourth Industrial Revolution, by calling for the deployment of the latest technologies and environmentally-friendly techniques; specific targets for 2020 include reducing the number of days where people experience heavy pollution by 25%. Meanwhile the sharing economy can help decouple economic growth from resource use. The National Information Centre has estimated the Chinese sharing economy was worth about $229 billion in 2015, and would grow 40% annually until 2020 - when it could account for as much as 10% of GDP. Increasing the general awareness of environmental problems and strengthening the enforcement of related standards will be challenging, however, due to the vested interests of key state-owned enterprises in the oil, gas and coal industries. Strong public-private partnerships will therefore be needed.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.30"
"4.278","Environmental Risks","","A dizzying array of large, natural catastrophic events in 2017, including the Hurricanes Harvey (Texas), Irma (Florida), and Maria (Puerto Rico), all of which hit within a four-week span, drained the capital out of the global property & casualty insurance and reinsurance sectors, according to Swiss Re’s global insurance review and outlook published in 2017. Total insured losses resulting from the three hurricanes alone amounted to more than $90 billion. Catastrophic loss events are becoming more common, and more devastating for more regions of the world. According to the so-called Clausius-Clapeyron equation, every half degree celsius of global warming results in a roughly 3% increase in atmospheric moisture. In addition to climate change, other contributing factors to the worsening weather situation include overbuilding in vulnerable locations, inadequate infrastructure, and increased pollution in densely-populated urban areas. The start of 2018 only brought more examples of extreme weather, including the “bomb cyclone” that brought heavy snow and strong winds to the east coast of the US, and Storm Eleanor, which hit the United Kingdom with gusts of up to 90 miles per hour. Extreme weather events rank first among global risks in terms of likelihood, according to the World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Report published in 2018 - and second among global risks in terms of impact. The insurance industry can actually play a positive role in terms of promoting better preparedness for climate change and related catastrophic effects; an article published in the Harvard Business Review in August 2017 suggested that private property insurers could, for example, better differentiate on policy pricing based on the risk that a property may be subjected to coastal flooding, thereby discouraging building in vulnerable areas, or offer discounts to homeowners who proactively protect their houses from potential wildfires. Another element examined in the article is what insurers can do to prompt local governments to better prepare for climate change-induced environmental disaster. Swiss Re, for example, has partnered with a company to offer a new type of catastrophe bond that rewards municipalities for investing in disaster protection, by lowering the rates that municipalities must pay bondholders based on the amount of risk reduction achieved.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.82"
"4.279","Environmental Stewardship","","On March 15, 2019 an estimated 1.6 million students in more than 120 countries, inspired by 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, walked out of class and marched in the streets to demand a more aggressive response to climate change. Their climate strike followed the 2018 publication of a report by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warning that, barring unprecedented action, the planet was just 12 years away from a climate catastrophe. Climate change caused by human activity has already dramatically intensified drought and flooding, and promises to make such extreme weather conditions more common. According to a study published in the journal Nature in 2017, drought recovery times are getting longer everywhere - and, without new restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions, the time between droughts will grow shorter as the time required for recovery only grows longer. As people begin to think about and engage with these issues more, one metric to keep in mind is the so-called Seventh Generation Principle - an American Indian concept that holds that decisions made now should help to guarantee well-being for the next seven generations.     In addition to climate change, other environmental issues that must be addressed include the depletion of animal species, forests, and other natural resources (according to a report published in 2018 by the World Wildlife Fund, the global wildlife population decreased by 60% between 1970 and 2014). Businesses can help societies tackle these problems. In many cases, they may not have a choice - as large institutional investors increasingly attach values-based conditions. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the holder of shares equal to an average of 1.4% of all publicly-traded companies in the world, has pushed the firms it backs to more actively report their carbon dioxide emissions, for example. Choosing to take a leadership role on environmental issues can pay geopolitical dividends, as well. China, for example, has increasingly been looked to by other nations as a leader when it comes to international efforts to address climate change due to its heavy investments in renewable energy, and due to indications that the US has a decreasing desire to play such a role under the administration of President Donald Trump.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.131"
"4.280","Environmental Sustainability","","The environmental impact of some blockchain technologies - especially those that rely on “mining,” or confirming transactions by using computing power to solve difficult math problems - is a source of controversy. The mining employed to support the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, for example, sucks up enough electricity to power about 6.4 million US households, a consumption level roughly equivalent to that of the Czech Republic, according to the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index published by the website Digiconomist; a single Bitcoin transaction could power nearly 33 US households for an entire day, according to the index. As the price of a single Bitcoin rose from about $2,300 in May 2017 to more than $7,000 roughly one year later, demand for cryptocurrency mining surged. Despite projected advances in the energy efficiency of mining hardware, cryptocurrency miners have sought out cheaper, more abundant energy sources in places such as the Nordic countries in Europe and rural areas of the US. Some utilities have expressed reservations about providing energy for mining. Still, utilities have found their own internal uses for blockchain; in early 2018, European utilities disclosed plans to directly trade energy with each other using the technology.  So-called peer-to-peer energy markets are just one way in which blockchain technology can actually play a key role in better protecting the environment. The so-called circular economy, which involves re-using materials and resources in order to prevent waste, can benefit from the use of blockchain to better track of materials like wood or fabric throughout their stages of use, according to a report published in 2016 by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. In addition, someone buying a bicycle, for example, could benefit from blockchain technology by automatically receiving an unaltered chain of details about materials used to build the bicycle, where it was built, and who built it, according to the report. Blockchain can also be used to facilitate carbon trading, or the practice of businesses buying credits that offset the greenhouse gas emissions caused by their operations through funding environmentally-friendly initiatives. Ice cream maker Ben & Jerry’s launched a pilot program in 2018 that uses blockchain to directly connect the sale of individual scoops sold over the counter to carbon credits that fund a forest conservation project in Peru.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.24"
"4.281","Environmental, Social and Governance","","A paradigm shift began after the financial crisis dramatically demonstrated the inter-dependence of individual financial choices, markets, economies, and global challenges like climate change. Meanwhile stagnant economic growth, mounting populism, and rising inequality all point to governments’ limited ability to provide effective solutions. Against this backdrop, new preferences are forming, particularly among young people. A growing share of consumption is focused on goods and services that provide a collective experience, for example, while an awareness of climate change is spreading, and sustainability has become a key buzzword as corporations increasingly observe so-called environmental, social and governance, or ESG, standards. Institutional investors have also started to embrace the ESG agenda. More than 1,500 investors and managers, representing nearly $60 trillion in assets under management, have signed the United Nations-backed Principles for Responsible Investment. Yet, many investors struggle to convert related commitments into practice. According to McKinsey, less than 1% of the total capital at the 15 largest US public pension funds is allocated to ESG-specific strategies, such as ESG-screened passive indexes. Many institutional investors continue to treat ESG as a marketing tool, rather than an integral part of a strategy. In recent years, a number of related initiatives have emerged that have boosted the adoption of ESG. One of the most promising developments is so-called “green bonds,” or traditional fixed income instruments used to finance exclusively environmentally sustainable projects. Another financial innovation gaining ground is impact investing, where commercial returns are coupled with socio-economic or environmental impact. Institutional investors such as endowments and sovereign development funds have been particularly active as part of this new investment model, which aims to achieve a triple bottom-line measured according to profit, environmental impact, and social benefit. Only time will tell if ESG can become mainstream. The extent to which institutional investors begin to access and promote ESG objectives requires an assessment of where they align with existing asset classes and investment products - and an understanding of strategies that can further specific ESG goals. This shift in perspective will enable institutional investors to play a larger role in shaping the future of various industries, as they incorporate these criteria into their investment portfolios.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.81"
"4.282","Environmentally-Sustainable Consumerism","","By 2027, about 65% of Chinese households will qualify as middle class, and annual consumption in the country is expected to reach $8.2 trillion - up from $4.3 trillion just a decade earlier - according to a report published by the World Economic Forum in 2018. Meanwhile annual consumer spending in India is expected to increase to $6 trillion by 2030 from $1.5 trillion in 2019, according to a separate Forum report. This increase will have a significant environmental impact, if it follows the path established by developed markets and involves vast conspicuous consumption and intensive resource use. Consumers everywhere need to be encouraged to help mitigate resource scarcity, combat climate change, curb plastics pollution, and eliminate food waste with their choices. In order to make this a reality, consumers need to be excited by the prospect of sustainability, and genuinely motivated to engage; too often, they may not see sustainability as relevant to their daily lives, or they may avoid more sustainable products often seen as relatively expensive or ineffective. Businesses must make sustainable choices more accessible and affordable, while redesigning product lines and increasing their portfolios of sustainable options. Sustainability-focused business models have been proven to have real value, and can be scaled up significantly. The sharing economy, for example, which generally provides access to things like cars and real estate rather than ownership, in the form of an Uber ride or an Airbnb stay, is a potential means to achieve more sustainable consumption by decreasing cars on the highway, for example, and related emissions (though serious questions have been raised about whether car-sharing services may actually aggravate issues like traffic congestion by encouraging people to avoid public transit). Another critical emerging business model is related to the “circular economy,” which involves minimizing waste by re-using materials rather than discarding them. Circular economy principles could help blunt the environmental impact of the consumer waste that will inevitably be generated by an expanding middle class, according to an article published by McKinsey in 2017. For example, old tires could be used as industrial fuel, according to the article, while applying liquid-chemical extraction to discarded electronics could multiply their value.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.57"
"4.283","Equitable Growth and Opportunity","","The United Kingdom saw a particularly sharp increase in income inequality during the 1980s, which has only been slightly reduced since then, according to the UK Office for National Statistics; measured in terms of a Gini coefficient, where zero represents equally-shared income across all households and 100 means one household holds all income, the UK’s score increased to 31.5 by 2017, from 27.3 in 1977. Meanwhile the country’s score based on the ratio of income for the richest 10% of its households to that of the poorest 40% increased to 127.2 by 2017, from 100 in 1977, according to data published by the Office for National Statistics. According to the charity The Equality Trust, unequal access to the benefits of globalization and innovation was a significant factor behind the UK’s popular vote to leave the European Union in 2016 (in addition to attitudes towards immigration and trade, and notions of sovereignty). Trying to convince someone struggling to put food on the table about the transformative power of the new sharing economy, for example, would be unlikely to be successful, the charity noted shortly after the Brexit vote. One particular disparity in the UK that merits attention exists between relatively wealthy and economically productive inner London, and other areas of the country. A report published by the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce in 2014 showed significant discrepancies in terms of economic progress between 1998 and 2011, with 27% growth in East Inner London, 10% growth in West Inner London, and declines ranging between about 14% and 23% for outer London, Coventry, Southampton, and Leicester over the same period. The report also cited a large disparity in terms of labour productivity per hour worked; London scored 131.2 on a related index, compared with 96.4 for the east of England, 91.7 for the northwest, 87.1 for the West Midlands, and 85.2 for Wales. Within London, inequality is also pronounced. According to a report published in 2017 by Trust for London, a charitable foundation, about half of the city’s wealth is owned by just 10% of the population, and 27% of Londoners are technically living in poverty. The Trust for London report also noted that the top 10% of earners in London enjoyed an income that was eight times higher than the income earned by the bottom 10%, up from about 6.5 times higher as of 1997.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.129"
"4.284","Equity and Social Justice","","Scientific advances may enable humans to improve everything from their memory to their appearance. As new technologies and options for enhancement are developed, there arises a need for social systems that can ensure people will be granted affordable access. Inequality in terms of accessibility could cause social tension, and unfair competition - and potentially create twin tracks for those with only average abilities versus groups that have been enhanced. The divide between enhanced and non-enhanced could, for example, create unfairness in the ways that performance and specific capabilities are assessed, due to a division between humans who use enhancing technologies and those who do not. It is also possible that certain performance enhancing methods may come to be considered doping (or, at least, a lack of transparency on the use of these technologies could be considered doping). Meanwhile efforts to level the playing field could lead to the default implementation of certain enhancing technologies, and create pressure on competitors to implement enhancements just in order to keep up. Globally, a system could develop where regions with relatively loose related regulation push other countries to de-regulate, in order to compete. According to the results of a Pew Research Center survey conducted in the US and published in 2016, 73% of respondents believed inequality will increase if brain chips become available, as initially they would only be obtainable for the wealthy. In addition, 63% believed the ability to receive synthetic blood transfusions would make recipients feel superior to those who have not received them, according to the survey results. Due to our cultural, religious, and economic differences, we will likely face serious challenges in terms of regionally uneven distribution, and advancement, of these technologies - which in turn may yield greater social inequality. This will force us to confront questions about how we can prevent regional and cultural division through global governance, how we can best evaluate and contextualize results made possible by enhancing interventions, and how human enhancement can be obtained in an affordable way. There is also the question of boundaries; that is, how much enhancement is too much enhancement. As we enter into a “trans-human” era, guidelines must be clarified.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.72"
"4.285","Ethics and Identity","","Innovation triggered by the Fourth Industrial Revolution, in disciplines like biotechnology and artificial intelligence, is redefining what it means to be human by pushing the limits of lifespan, health, and cognition in ways once confined to science fiction. As knowledge progresses and new discoveries are made, a related moral and ethical discussion is critical - if people are to be able to appropriately respond to phenomena like life extension, so-called designer babies, and memory extraction. The biological domain in particular poses a range of ethical challenges when it comes to regulation and social norms. New technologies present questions about what it means to be human, what information about personal health should be shared, and what rights and responsibilities we have with regard to altering the genetic code of future generations. Many other questions are likely to arise with regard to human augmentation, and to how societies should deal with machines that have human-like qualities and an ability to autonomously make life-or-death decisions. Related privacy, data security, and identity issues are becoming increasingly important for policy-makers, regulators, and companies. There are also growing concerns that, as the Fourth Industrial Revolution deepens our individual and collective relationships with technology, it may negatively affect social skills - like the ability to empathize. We already see this happening. A 2010 study by the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research identified a nearly 40% decline in empathy among college students compared with counterparts 20 or 30 years earlier. Most of that decline occurred after the year 2000. According to results of a study published by Nielsen in 2017, millennials in the US spend about six hours per week on social media, while members of Generation X (age 35 to 49) spend nearly seven hours. As face-to-face conversation is crowded out by online interaction, there are fears that people will begin to struggle to listen, make eye contact, or accurately read body language. To combat these challenges, there is a need to ensure that the Fourth Industrial Revolution fosters individualism and humanity, and is an empowering force that fosters technology as a tool that is made by people, and for people. Individuals and organizations need to take collective responsibility for creating a future where innovation and technology genuinely serve the public interest.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.55"
"4.286","Ethics and Legality","","A serious downside to a fully-realized future for Precision Medicine (or ""Personalized Medicine"") is the fact that the genomic and other biological data included in personal medical records will be subject to potential misuse by bad actors with financial or other incentives. Without strong, enduring privacy laws, people with a certain genotype (or genetic makeup) may find themselves uninsurable, unemployable, or otherwise discriminated against. Genomic data can also accurately identify parentage, which could lead to invasions of privacy in cases such as adoption proceedings. Ethical and legal considerations regarding who may access individual genomic and other data, and how that data is used, are of paramount concern. In addition, rules governing the use of patient data for research purposes (often called ""secondary use,"" as the data is used beyond the scope of immediate clinical care) are critical. Secondary use requires a balance between a person's right to privacy and the need to create a healthcare system where every patient encounter can be an opportunity to improve care. Efforts to achieve such a balance can be aided by improved informed consent and risk communication, and by robust data de-identification and synthesis techniques. The relative cost of Precision Medicine may be high, due to the technology required and the expense of developing individualized medicines and treatments. However, cost savings are also possible, as ineffective treatments may be avoided for some patients. Ensuring access to Precision Medicine for everyone is critical, so that disparities in health care outcomes are not exacerbated. Another potentially problematic aspect of Precision Medicine, from an ethical standpoint, is the use of genomic information that predicts disease where there is no actionable treatment or preventative available; advance knowledge of an untreatable condition may reduce the quality of life. The question of when people should be informed of their risk of untreatable disease promises to continue to present thorny ethical issues.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.109"
"4.287","European Reforms","","Europe is at a turning point. The 2016 Brexit vote, and the United Kingdom’s ongoing negotiations to withdraw from the European Union, have placed the potential deconstruction of the political bloc in the spotlight. The EU needs to find a long-term solution to its migration and refugee crisis, and to take a leading role in coordinating the global fight against terrorism. While the eurozone continues apace with its economic recovery, it remains to be seen if growth can be sustained. France’s GDP growth, for example, is projected to fall to 1.7% for 2018, from 2.2% in 2017, according to the European Commission. The Franco-German alliance has historically been the engine driving the European project forward, and pushing necessary reforms to address challenges confronting EU institutions. In a September 2017 speech delivered at the Sorbonne, recently-elected President Emmanuel Macron presented plans for a renewed EU that embraces globalization and innovation, promotes European interests and values, and protects Europeans from new security threats. Specific proposals put forward by Macron included putting up pan-European candidates for European Parliamentary elections in 2019, creating a European intelligence agency and a common military budget, and appointing a eurozone finance minister. A deeper financial integration within the eurozone, and a common eurozone budget, are also needed. In addition, the EU requires a clearer common foreign policy, while economic cooperation across European states must be deepened, in order to better foster digital business development. Meanwhile the sort of increased military coordination and budgets envisioned by Macron could conceivably better ensure the security of European citizens. In June 2018, Macron’s efforts were rewarded when nine EU member states including Germany, Spain, and Belgium agreed to set up a European military force designed to be rapidly deployed at times of crisis. This so-called European Intervention Initiative is structurally separate from the EU, meaning that Britain - which also signed on to Macron’s plan - could take part following the country’s planned exit from the political bloc in 2019.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.56"
"4.288","Evolving Manufacturing Skills","","About 65% of the children now entering primary school will eventually have a job that does not currently exist, according to a report published by the World Economic Forum; as more business models are disrupted, it will very soon have a broad, profound impact on employment. One of the biggest factors driving that change is the advancement of manufacturing technologies. This will transform manufacturing into a relatively sophisticated sector in need of fewer workers and more skilled engineers. Overall, as much as one quarter of the tasks currently completed by industrial workers in developed countries could be automated by 2025, according to the McKinsey Global Institute. Preparing these workers for the challenges of a transitioning labour market poses a serious challenge for both governments and companies, and is likely to require an inclusive, multi-stakeholder approach. In addition, schools and universities need to better anticipate the changes being brought about by disruptive innovation, and adapt accordingly - while outside of school, lifelong learning must become more common for workers in need of new skills for the future. Educational institutions also need to collaborate more closely with governments and companies, in order to identify essential skills and attributes for the future - particularly those related to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), in addition to critical thinking, innovation, and organizational science (studying the hows and whys of the ways that organizations function). One example: there is currently a looming shortage of data scientists, making it a potentially ideal educational and career path. In general, most business leaders need to reorient their strategies in order to close the gap between employee supply and demand, and to better manage the advent of continuously evolving technologies. Innovative ways of upgrading employees’ existing skills must be integrated into businesses’ daily routines. At the same time, companies need to be prepared to accommodate the preferences and requirements of a new generation of digital natives. To that end, businesses can deploy digitally-enabled training that makes use of augmented reality (using a device to “see” virtual objects in a real space), virtual reality (a completely virtual simulation of a space), and mixed reality (a blending of virtual objects with a physical space).","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.3"
"4.289","Extremism and Security in Pakistan","","After the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the US, Pakistan’s security situation became more tenuous due to its engagement in the broader war on terror. However, things have improved in recent years. According to National Internal Security Policy documents, incidents of terrorism in Pakistan declined to 175 in 2018, from 2,061 in 2010. Meanwhile the number of related casualties has decreased, while incidents of sectarian violence have fallen nearly to zero. The joint military operations Zarb-e-Azb (2014) and Radd-ul-Fasaad (2017) played major roles in helping to control terrorism by going after militant groups, sleeper cells, and hidden security threats. However, in early 2019 the Pakistan-based extremist group Jaish-e-Mohammed carried out a suicide bombing that killed 40 Indian security personnel in Kashmir. This occurred despite the Pakistani government’s National Action Plan, which aims to reduce extremism and terrorism by addressing hate speech and the glorification of terrorists, the registration and supervision of madrassas (Islamic religious schools), the financing of terrorism, and the regulation of cyberspace and the media.  The issue of security in the country remains pressing. Major areas of concern identified by authorities include the alienation and frustration of young people, regional inequality, a lack of justice and rule of law, and a lack of accountability. When it comes to extremism and security, Pakistani society is stuck between liberal and religious orders; both mindsets tend to undermine each other. Meanwhile foreign actors have used each group to pursue varying agendas, and Pakistanis are paying the price. Security risks persist in the province of Balochistan, where the Baloch Liberation Army has targeted China’s local influence. Pakistan has signed a number of memorandums of understanding on fighting terrorism and extremism with both developed and developing countries, though tackling the issue takes time; given its relatively recent transition to democracy after years of military rule, patience is required. Many of the country’s ills are by-products of the Soviet-Afghan war that began in 1979 and is ongoing in one form or another. Only greater cooperation and trust can help improve its security situation, and enable Pakistan to play a role in helping other countries in the region achieve a sustainable peace.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.105"
"4.290","Fighting Poverty in Bangladesh","","Despite the country’s healthy economic growth, inequality remains a significant concern in Bangladesh. (An added challenge has arrived in the form of more than 700,000 Rohingya refugees forced to flee from neighbouring Myanmar; Bangladesh will require significant international financial support to address their needs). The percentage of the country’s population living below the poverty line fell to 24.3% as of 2016, from 40% in 2005, according to the Bangladesh Household Expenditure Survey. There has also been some reduction in the rural-urban divide, and the country’s East-West divide, related to poverty. A high inflow of remittances from abroad to rural areas, social safety net programmes, and microcredit and social awareness campaigns led by non-governmental organizations have bolstered development. Yet, income inequality has in some ways actually increased since the early 1980s. In 2016, the country’s wealthiest 10% had income levels 2.9 times higher than the bottom 40%, a rate that was about 1.5 times higher than it had been in 1983-84. Still, the government’s fiscal 2017-2018 budget allocated an amount less than 1.5% of Bangladesh’s GDP to social safety net programmes (excluding pension components), lower than the 3% recommended by the government’s National Social Security Strategy. Bangladesh has committed to United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, which were established in 2015 and aim for zero poverty, zero hunger, and reduced inequality by 2030. Successfully reducing income inequality requires addressing its root causes: weak job creation; a skills gap between what is desired and what is available; unplanned urbanization; a lack of diversification of the economy; and corruption. Investing in people will be necessary to benefit from the demographic dividend arriving as a big portion of young people reach working age. More inclusive development will also depend upon improving access to quality primary and secondary education, and to health care, and altering societal norms regarding violence and domestic decision making. Skills training programmes for minorities and the transgender community could help these people successfully enter the job market, as could strong public-private partnerships. Successful implementation of the government’s “Digital Bangladesh” vision, and initiatives to strengthen good governance, will be essential, as will a stronger focus on gender-inclusive growth. In addition, since the poor are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, environmentally sustainable development is necessary.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.17"
"4.291","Finance, Technology and the Economy","","Technology has changed the ways companies communicate with and understand their customers - while customers have gained unprecedented options. The financial industry in particular can now serve customers who have not traditionally made use of its services, thanks to innovation (though the lingering effects of the 2008 financial crisis have caused many to wonder about the potential social costs of new technologies). As the global economy searches for new growth engines there is an increasing consensus, particularly in emerging economies such as China, that more people must play a more active role in economic development. Financial technology (fintech), and more inclusive finance, can facilitate this. Such fundamental global financial sector development is particularly critical for emerging economies, which might otherwise face problems with financial repression and a lack of capital formation. By taking leading roles in the development of fintech, countries like China and India have also demonstrated how emerging economies can help build a financial system that is drastically different from the traditional model, and can bypass some of the traditional elements that have featured in financial market development in the West. However, there are growing, related concerns. Healthy debate about the relationship between fintech and regulation, consumer protection, market power, data security, investor suitability, financial literacy, and education should be taking place. The recent tightening of China’s regulations governing once-booming, small, and relatively accessible cash loans highlights the potential shocks to the financial system and society that can result if financial innovation is allowed to grow without proper oversight. The exorbitant fees charged alongside these small consumer loans, the potentially violent repercussions for defaulting on them, and the exploitation of borrowers’ lack of financial literacy demonstrated how good ideas can be quickly tarnished, creating a negative impact far beyond the financial sector. Related questions have been raised about some of China’s recent public-private-partnership (PPP) experiments. It has become evident that a vast majority of PPP funds are tied to bond-like structures that promise safe and attractive returns. Investors are therefore not motivated by financial returns, as much as they are by the implicit guarantees offered by governments behind the projects. It was this type of dynamic that eventually led to the financial crisis, and has contributed to the rapid escalation of China’s national debt. This key issue is curated in partnership with Zhu Ning, PBC School of Finance and Associate Dean at the National Institute of Financial Research, Tsinghua University.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.30"
"4.292","Financial Products and Services","","Blockchain technology may be best known as the underpinning of virtual currencies such as Bitcoin, which have touched off a speculative fury as investors place bets on new, decentralized means of payment. But blockchains can help to efficiently address the need for multiple, cost-effective financial products and services that can comply with relatively exacting financial regulation. For example, transparency and auditability requirements can potentially be more easily met by using blockchain. Theoretically, instead of having to send requests for information to a bank or other type of organization, an auditor could simply verify transactions on a publicly-available blockchain ledger thanks to its fixed permanence, according to an article published by the consultancy Deloitte in 2017. In addition, because a high value financial transaction on blockchain can potentially require only about one hour to be cleared, whereas a traditional transaction of the same value might require as much as a month or more to be cleared, the technology could make more frequent audits possible, according to the article. More broadly, blockchain can be viewed as moving the financial services industry away from process-oriented approaches, and towards data-based workstreams. Insurance is another example of a service where blockchain could dramatically improve processes. In 2016, a group of insurance and reinsurance companies including Allianz, Swiss Re and Munich Re launched an initiative to explore ways to use blockchain technology to provide faster and more secure services. The following year, the group presented a prototype smart contract management system, designed to cover everything from setup to settling claims. When it comes to cross-border financial transactions, blockchain could also theoretically play a helpful role. In March 2018, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or SWIFT, tested the use of blockchain technology to reconcile payments among accounts spread across 34 banks; the test showed that the technology has made significant progress in terms of security and governance, though it was not yet ready to support large-scale, mission-critical global infrastructures, according to SWIFT. Compliance with international trade regulations could also be improved through the use of blockchain, by creating immutable audit trails. In 2017, Deloitte and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced they had developed a blockchain technology proof of concept for trade finance, which included participants such as the Bank of China (Hong Kong), Hang Seng Bank and Standard Chartered Bank.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.24"
"4.293","Financial Regulation","","Regulatory changes implemented since the financial crisis roughly a decade ago, designed to protect consumers and economies, have created challenges for the insurance industry. One example: while insurers in the US had been relatively free to address cyber-risk in their own way, new regulations such as those implemented by the New York Department of Financial Services in 2017 now require firms to appoint a chief information security officer, and to have their boards approve a written data security policy, according to Deloitte’s 2018 Insurance Outlook. The Deloitte report notes that insurers must take into account multiplying additional compliance demands, which could be especially challenging for small and mid-sized companies. Another particular focus of insurance firms is the so-called Insurance Distribution Directive (IDD) being rolled out in Europe, which is designed to improve consumer protection and bolster competition. It will require companies to provide more information to customers, and limit product offers to only those made in response to actual customer need and demand, according to an information update published by the consultancy PwC in early 2018. Meanwhile IFRS 9, an international standard that came into effect in 2018, affects the ways that insurance companies can assess and present the value of the investment portfolios that underpin their businesses. There is ongoing debate about the so-called systemic relevance of insurance companies, or their size and the potential risk they pose relative to the economies where they operate (and the corresponding need to closely monitor their stability). In 2016, the Financial Stability Board published a list of nine insurers in the world deemed systemically relevant, including Germany’s Allianz, American International Group (AIG) in the US, and Ping An Insurance in China. The FSB did not publish an updated list in 2017, and noted that new ways to assess systemic risk in the insurance sector were being developed that could affect which insurers are identified as systemically relevant. One of the key metrics that regulators assess when it comes to the biggest insurance firms is their level of capital on hand relative to expected losses. Under Solvency II, a set of rules implemented in 2016, insurers in the European Union must be nearly 100% sure they have enough capital to deal with their worst expectations of losses over the course of a year.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.82"
"4.294","Financial Risk and Resilience","","The Panama Papers, a trove of documents detailing the efforts of financial and legal firms around the world to help clients avoid taxes (and in some cases facilitate corruption and launder funds), were publicly released in 2015. The following year, the consultancy Oliver Wyman published a report noting that a number of bankers being summoned before parliamentary committees had surged, and that reputation risk was increasingly a focus for supervisory boards and management; its research also showed that the share price impact of a bank’s disclosure of a sanctions violation could be six times the size of an actual fine. The Paradise Papers, a second trove of leaked documents, this time detailing the use of secret offshore investment structures, followed in 2017 - further increasing public scrutiny of the financial services sector. Some regulators have begun to take reputation risk into account as they develop rules and regulations for banks. The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, for example, has introduced a Senior Managers and Certification Regime that requires firms to assess a senior management candidate’s honesty, integrity and reputation.     An increasingly significant threat to financial stability is related to cyber risk. According to an International Monetary Fund working paper published in 2018, the 49 cyber-attacks reported to the UK financial authorities during 2017 likely represented an under-reporting of successful attacks during the year, and noted that only 7% of thousands of annual reports filed by US firms in 2017 included references to cyber risk. The increasing inter-connectedness of networks used to transfer information means that anything an everything can be exposed, and critical infrastructure (and even basic human rights) can be compromised as a result, according to a report published by the International Telecommunications Union in 2017. In response to cyber-related and other means of financial crime, efforts have been made to better coordinate global anti-financial crime and anti-money laundering efforts. The Financial Action Task Force sets global standards for combatting money laundering, and regularly publishes a list of countries deemed to not be cooperating in international efforts to curb financial crime and terrorist financing. The CAMELS rating system is meanwhile used by regulators to score banks operating in the US on aspects including capital adequacy and management capability; a bank’s CAMELS score is not made public.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.52"
"4.295","Financial System","","Ghana’s performance in this area of the Index shows the greatest room for improvement in terms of the total market value of domestic, publicly-traded companies relative to GDP (referred to as ""market capitalization"" in the competitiveness index), where it has a progress score (ranging from a poor mark of zero to a top mark of one hundred) of 7.90, resulting in a rank of 96th out of 121 countries; in terms of insurance premium volumes as a percentage of GDP where it has a progress score of 19.00 that results in a rank of 92nd out of 135 countries; and in terms of domestic lending to the private sector where it has a progress score of 21.00 that results in a rank of 122nd out of 140 countries. Other indicators reflect a better performance: the discrepancy between current domestic lending to businesses and an anticipated long-term trend (referred to as ""credit gap"" in the competitiveness index), where it has a progress score of 100.00 that results in a rank of 1st out of 140 countries; and in terms of the protective capital held by banks relative to assets where it has a progress score of 100.00 that results in a rank of 40th out of 118 countries.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.67"

"4.297","Fiscal Policy Measures","","Roughly a decade after the global financial crisis, national debt levels in advanced economies are near their highest levels since World War II, averaging 104% of GDP, according to a study published in the International Monetary Fund’s quarterly magazine in 2018. That places significant pressure on governments to find ways to cut spending or increase tax revenue (or somehow do both), according to the study. This is particularly true now, as central banks seem poised to gradually increase interest rates, thereby potentially directing more government funds into making interest payments and leaving less for public services like infrastructure and education. Policy-makers must find ways to address deficits that do not hinder economic growth. Some economists argue that cutting government spending is best for restoring fiscal health and stirring growth, and others counter that it is only by increasing spending that economies can truly be reinvigorated. While raising taxes can also be necessary to tackle budget deficits, arguments have been made that tax hikes can choke economic growth by discouraging work, investment, and innovation.   While countries need to strike a balance between taxes and spending as they seek to balance budgets and preserve social protections, there is ongoing debate about which of the two elements to lean on more heavily. There are certain types of spending that can actually lower a budget deficit, primarily related to “program integrity” measures that target fraud, tax evasion, and bureaucratic mistakes, according to an analysis published by the Brookings Institution in 2015. Such spending aimed at curbing improper payments in the US’s Medicare health insurance program for people 65 or older could yield about $14 for every dollar spent, according to the analysis, while spending an additional $1 billion annually on reviews meant to determine whether or not to grant disability insurance could save the US’s Social Security Administration $43 billion. As policy-makers seek the best formula for addressing their country’s particular challenges, they must be mindful not only of the impact it may have on deficits and economic growth, but also of the potential impact on large parts of the population - and how the population may react. In France, for example, a government decision in late 2018 to increase gasoline taxes in order to reduce reliance on fossil fuels sparked regular street protests by thousands of gilets jaunes (“yellow vests”) for better wages and better public services.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.111"
"4.298","Flexible Manufacturing","","3D printing means that the cost of making something has been liberated from a need to make a lot of it. Traditionally, manufacturers have been bound by the principle that the more they produce, the more costs decline. 3D printing can alter this dynamic, by for example reducing or even eliminating the need for tooling - the process of developing series of moulds and dies needed for production (traditional injection moulding, for example, requires a series of precision-machined moulds in which to inject heated metal or other material). 3D printing can therefore drastically decrease the time needed to bring a new product to market, slash the costs associated with making moulds, and lead to a situation where the cost-per-produced-part is not related to the potentially high overall cost of production including tooling and other elements. When a single 3D printing machine is able to produce complex parts requiring limited post-processing steps, the economy of scale associated with traditional large factories becomes obsolete - while more regional and local production becomes economically viable. In late 2017, Daimler Trucks North America announced a pilot program for making 3D printed truck and bus parts on demand. The move was designed to slim down management and reduce the need to maintain inventory, while re-directing capital saved in the process to the development of new products (shipping time and related costs are also eliminated as part of this process). A similar approach could be widely applied in the automotive industry, where large stocks of spare parts for older vehicles can be eliminated. In addition, because a number of products can be manufactured in a single batch using the same 3D printer (if they are made out of the same material), that creates an ability to produce highly-customized parts at almost no additional cost. This has been the case in the healthcare industry, for example, when it comes to the production of customized implants and stents, and in the fashion and apparel industries, which place a premium on customization.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.0"
"4.299","Food Technology and Innovation","","Billions of people around the world are poorly nourished, millions of farmers must live at a subsistence level, enormous amounts of food go to waste, and poor farming practices are taking a toll on the environment. Achieving United Nations Sustainable Development Goals will require the transformation of food systems, so that they become more inclusive, sustainable, efficient, and nourishing. This calls for improved policy, increased investment, and expanded infrastructure, in addition to building more capacity for farmers, changing consumer behaviour, and improving resource management. Until recently, the food and agriculture sectors were slow to adopt technologies driving the Fourth Industrial Revolution like the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and blockchain; there have been low levels of related investment, inspiring relatively few related startups. A total of just $14 billion was invested in about 1,000 food systems-focused startups between 2010 and 2018, according to the World Economic Forum report Innovation With a Purpose: the Role of Technology Innovation in Accelerating Food System Transformation. By way of comparison, $145 billion was invested in approximately 18,000 healthcare-related startups over the same period. Fragmented rural markets, poor infrastructure, and heavy regulatory burdens raise costs for food systems firms, while revenue is often constrained by customers’ limited ability or willingness to pay. In addition, much of the food systems startup activity to date has been concentrated on improving production in developed countries - which can result in less access to new solutions in developing countries. The Forum, in collaboration with McKinsey & Company, has highlighted technology applications that present emerging opportunities to improve consumer nutrition, increase supply-chain efficiency and transparency, and boost farmer productivity and profitability. While many are in early stages, they could deliver significant positive impacts for food systems by 2030. For example, if consumers were able to replace between 10% and 15% of the meat they consume with alternative proteins by 2030, total greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture could drop by between 5% and 8%, freshwater withdrawals for agriculture could be reduced by between 7% and 12%, and between 5% and 10% of the total land used for agriculture could be freed up for other uses.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","['1.9', '1.60']"
"4.300","Foreign Investment, Local Disconnect","","Viet Nam, which began opening up its centralized economy in the 1980s, is now a party to 16 different free trade agreements, and is negotiating more. Foreign direct investment inflows soared to $12.6 billion as of 2016, from $2.4 billion in 1996, according to the World Bank - helping to move the country’s economy from one that relied heavily on exports tied to mining and raw materials towards an export mix associated with technology and manufacturing. However, despite investment inflows, local firms have struggled to capitalize on related opportunities. Not many local businesses participate in the same value chains and manufacturing networks that tie together multinational corporations, for example, and that limits potentially healthy interaction between local firms and multinationals in the country. ﻿The automobile industry provides a good example; while big names like Toyota, Honda, and Mercedes-Benz have established operations in Viet Nam, they mainly entail assembly facilities that employ relatively cheap labour. The locally-produced content in automobiles manufactured in the country remains relatively low. Toyota, for example, has a local content ratio for its Viet Nam production of less than 10%, according to a paper published by a Waseda University professor in 2017 - compared with a ratio of more than 80% for Japanese automakers as a whole in Thailand. The same trend is prevalent in Viet Nam among foreign producers of garments and technology products, where local firms tend to have no role in the production process beyond supplying packaging. Viet Nam needs to foster deeper ties between foreign and local firms operating in the country. That could involve being more selective in drawing particular types of foreign investment, and focusing on areas where Viet Nam may have competitive advantages. The government could also make efforts more generally to improve the business environment by upgrading infrastructure, and increasing spending on education, health, and R&D.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.132"
"4.301","Forest Communities","","The well-being of forest communities and Indigenous Peoples is closely tied to their environment; places where communities have strong land rights also have lower rates of deforestation and forest degradation. Few governments have established the legal protections needed to secure community land rights, however. As a consequence, Indigenous Peoples are losing their land to governments and corporations. Indigenous Peoples and local communities have the legal right to less than one third of the forests in low- and middle-income countries, according to Commodities and Forests Agenda 2020, published in 2017 by Tropical Forest Alliance 2020 and the World Economic Forum. Overall, Indigenous Peoples and local communities have legal rights to at least 513 million hectares of the world’s forests, or about one eighth of the total, according to the World Resources Institute’s 2014 report Securing Rights, Combating Climate Change. Much larger areas of forest are held by communities under customary rights, which are not legally recognized by governments. Most community-held forests are in low- and middle-income countries, where deforestation pressure is strong. When Indigenous Peoples and local communities have weak or no legal rights, their forests tend to be vulnerable to deforestation. According to the World Resources Institute’s 2014 report, in Indonesia, high levels of carbon dioxide emissions resulting from deforestation are due in part to weak or absent legal rights for forest communities. Another study of 80 forest areas in 10 different countries in South Asia, East Africa, and Latin America showed that community-owned and managed forests produce greater community benefits and improve carbon storage (the storage of carbon after it is emitted into the atmosphere). We will therefore forfeit an important opportunity to combat climate change, if we do not strengthen land rights for Indigenous Peoples and local communities. The Commodities and Forests Agenda 2020 report noted that a global consensus is emerging on the need for greater security of land tenure. The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals commit member states to ensure that everyone has equal rights to ownership and control over land by 2030. In addition, nearly every country has endorsed the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which guarantees land and territory rights. In some countries, communities have successfully lobbied for legal changes to recognize their land rights, while others are taking to the streets to voice their demands.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.54"
"4.302","Forest Landscape Restoration","","Most countries have an untapped resource: forest landscapes that could be restored and revitalized. Forest landscape restoration can revive “ecosystem services” (like air purification and climate regulation) and enhance human well-being in areas that have been cleared or degraded. In Ethiopia, for example, a government initiative resulted in more than 350 million trees being planted in a single day in 2019. Efforts like this can result in the establishment of dense forests, or high-yield agroforestry systems, as well as so-called mosaic systems - where wooded areas are interspersed among fields used for farming. Forest landscape restoration should not increase tree cover beyond what would be ecologically appropriate for a particular location - and should not introduce damaging, non-native species. More than two billion hectares of land have been identified as suitable for restoration around the world, which is an area equivalent to more than twice the size of China. Forest landscape restoration can diversify economies, reduce the damage caused by natural disasters, generate marketable forest and agricultural products, and support recreation and tourism. Restoration is therefore a growing investment opportunity; in Latin America and the Caribbean alone, related investments could yield roughly $23 billion in profit over a 50-year period, according to a report published in 2016 by the World Resources Institute. An additional $300 billion per year in global financing is needed for adequate forest restoration and conservation, which can in turn create jobs, help alleviate local poverty, and increase food security. Restoration can meanwhile improve soil and water quality, conserve biodiversity, and help mitigate climate change. For example, reforestation bids such as Ethiopia’s concerted effort can bolster carbon capture and storage - and reduce the impact of emissions. Forest landscape restoration can also help governments meet the requirements of international agreements, such as the UN Convention on Biological Diversity and the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. Thanks to the New York Declaration on Forests, and the Bonn Challenge, there is now a global effort underway to bring 350 million hectares of degraded and deforested land into restoration by 2030. These efforts are supported by commitments that have been made as part of regional restoration initiatives, including AFR100 in Africa, and Initiative 20x20 in Latin America and the Caribbean.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.54"
"4.303","Forestry and Forest Products","","The global forestry industry generates more than $60 trillion in annual revenue, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Demand for forest products is only increasing, due to population growth and improved living standards - which places added pressure on forest resources. While sustainable forestry efforts (including Ethiopia’s government-led initiative to plant more than 350 million trees in a single day in 2019) can help bolster and conserve resources, unsustainable practices persist. Illegal logging contributes to deforestation, biodiversity loss, and greenhouse gas emissions, while depriving governments of essential revenue. Logging in primary (old growth) forests and in intact forest landscapes typically leads to a cascade of human activity in remote regions, and eventual deforestation. Merely complying with existing laws could save almost 200 million hectares of natural forest in Brazil and Indonesia alone, according to a report published by the Tropical Forest Alliance 2020. Timber smuggling is not only an economic and environmental problem - it often involves criminal organizations and is tied to wildlife and drug trafficking, money laundering, corruption, conflict, and human rights violations. An increasing number of countries have put measures in place to reduce imports of illegally-harvested wood. These have increased incentives for private businesses to pay closer attention to their supply chains. However, truly effective measures to reduce illegal logging require broad cooperation among governments, the private sector, and civil society; efforts such as the World Resources Institute’s Forest Legality Initiative, WWF’s Global Forest and Trade Network, and The Nature Conservancy’s Responsible Asia Forestry and Trade Network are successfully combating illegal logging by supporting government bids to implement related policies, and by working with the private sector to both exclude illegal wood and implement independent monitoring. Some of the tools for sustainable forest management that have been employed include forest certification and tree plantations; while these plantations can supply some, but not all of the “ecosystem services” (such as air purification) that natural forests provide, they will have to play an increasingly prominent role in providing forest products in the future. Ultimately, though, it is essential that plantations do not completely supplant natural forests.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.54"
"4.304","French Economic Competitiveness","","France’s relatively high ranking in the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index has remained stable since 2012. However, the country’s weak ratings in the most recent edition for its macroeconomic environment (63rd out of 138 economies) and labour market efficiency (56th) are concerning. These are areas where France has historically ranked below its European peers. While the country has made efforts to curb its budget deficit, government debt levels remain high. In addition, there has been a deterioration of its capacity to attract talent from abroad. The Forum’s Competitiveness Index highlighted problematic factors for doing business in the country that include tax rates, restrictive labour regulations, and inefficient government bureaucracy. France is less competitive than its European neighbours largely due to its labour costs. According to Eurostat, France has the sixth-highest labour costs in Europe, at €36 per hour, behind Germany (€33 per hour), Italy (€28), and the United Kingdom (€27). This makes it relatively difficult for French firms to hire, which partly explains the high rate of unemployment the country has been dealing with for the past 30 years. The unemployment rate in France was 9.3% as of August 2018, according to Eurostat. France also has a relatively high level of compulsory taxes, equivalent to 46% of the country’s GDP as of 2015 - compared with an average of 40% for the eurozone, according to the research institute Coe-Rexecode. President Emmanuel Macron has pledged to give more flexibility to firms by reducing employers’ social contributions for employees. In addition, the government aims to revive growth and employment by scrapping the tax on wealth, gradually reducing the corporate tax rate from 33.33% to 25% by 2022, and by introducing a flat tax of 30% on capital gains. However, public spending remains a burden; it was equivalent to 56.5% of GDP as of 2016, according to the OECD. France has many competitive strengths, however; these include agriculture, luxury goods, aerospace, construction, and advertising. It also has a relatively high quality of rail, road and air transport infrastructure. The country is becoming a prominent player in new technologies. According to a study published in June 2017 by the French railroad company SNCF, €2.2 billion had been raised by technology startups in France since January of that year, or double the amount raised in all of 2016.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.56"
"4.305","From Siloes to Collaboration","","Traditionally, institutions designed digital identity systems from the narrow perspective of their own interaction with users. For those users, that meant inconvenient interfaces with multiple, often interoperable systems. Now, institutions are starting to respond to the broader digital context of users by exploring collaborative approaches that cut across traditional boundaries. National identity systems that are interoperable and scalable can save money, improve service delivery, and promote financial inclusion. For businesses, this same approach can enable more personalized experiences for customers, deepened levels of trust, reduced costs, and shared liability with other stakeholders. The European Union’s eIDAS standards promote the harmonization and mutual recognition of the national identity systems in all member states - which is convenient for EU citizens who can do things like open a bank account within the bloc simply by using a national identity card. In another example, Estonia and Finland have made the respective data layers of their identity systems interoperable, in order to enable seamless cross-border data sharing about Estonians who live in Finland but are registered for benefits and services back home. As of 2018, some 1,000 organizations in Estonia and 81 in Finland were using their data exchange layers to more easily deliver services. The United Nations Economic Commission for Africa and the African Union Commission are working together to increase the regional harmonization of digital identity standards, as part of the process of developing the African Continental Free Trade Area - the largest free trade area in the world in terms of participants. Within the private sector, South Korean mobile phone operator SK Telecom has developed “T-Auth,” which is designed to streamline online shopping by linking it to users’ mobile numbers; 99% of the country’s websites accept the service, and by late 2016 it had 13 million monthly users making 650 million transactions annually, SK Telecom said in a report published in 2017. Meanwhile in Sweden financial institutions have developed “BankID” for things like identification and account access, tax declarations, and document signing. BankID has an estimated 8 million active users; however, in 2018 14 people were found guilty of stealing the equivalent of about $160,000 by calling users, pretending to be a bank representative, and having the users log in to BankID while on the phone. Stakeholders in all sectors and industries should create collaborative business models, shared principles, standards, frameworks, and identity systems that are genuinely interoperable.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.41"
"4.306","Fusing Technologies","","The Fourth Industrial Revolution is different from prior industrial revolutions, in the way that it builds from a fusion of technologies, and from a growing harmonization and integration of research disciplines. Nearly every new development in any field now leverages digital capability. Precision genome editing, for example, could not have happened without relentless improvement in computing power and data analytics. Similarly, advanced robots would not exist without new approaches made to artificial intelligence dependent on digital systems and processing power. The digital and physical worlds also collide in fields such as autonomous vehicles and 3D printing. Advances in sensors are enabling robots and autonomous systems to understand and respond better to their environments, and to engage in a broader variety of tasks beyond the factory floors where they have been most prevalent historically. These systems can now access information remotely via the cloud, and connect with one another to exchange information and learn collectively. As the next generation of robots emerges as an element of the Internet of Things, there will be an increasing emphasis on human-machine collaboration. The physical and biological worlds are merging partly thanks to the creation of new materials that are designed to emulate the biological world. The discovery of new classes of recyclable, thermosetting polymers called polyhexahydrotriazines is a major step towards a more sustainable economy, for example. New materials are now routinely being used in medical implants, for tissue engineering, and for the creation of artificial organs, and 3D printing is increasingly being used to create customized structures. The biological and digital worlds overlap most controversially in the world of genetic engineering. Widely-accessible and affordable gene sequencing and editing systems, such as CRISPR/Cas9, make it possible to reliably and precisely remove or replace sequences in the genome of plants and animals. The biological and digital worlds are also overlapping in the form of sensors used to monitor personal health and behaviour, and to understand and influence brain activity. Advances that might have once been confined to digital systems, like the application of cryptography to blockchain technology to create programmable, secure, and distributed records, are now having widespread impact in the real world. Blockchain, for example, while it may be best known as the framework for virtual currency, can provide new ways to manage land records and track deforestation.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.55"
"4.307","Future Communications Systems","","The Internet of Things facilitates a flow of information between smart devices, cars, and home appliances; an estimated 8.4 billion physical objects were actively connected via the technology in 2017, according to the research firm Gartner, or an increase of nearly a third compared with the prior year. The impact this has on peoples’ daily lives is considerable. One can now cut travel time by making better decisions and taking an optimal route with less traffic, for example, while remote health monitoring for elderly patients is now more feasible. The spread of connected devices, and increased social media use and general online activity, have paved the way for new marketing techniques and customization, and play vital roles in new wealth creation. However, an increasing number of connected devices may make it difficult for wireless service providers to guarantee quality; one way to reduce cost and latency for the Internet of Things might be to deploy decentralizing blockchain technology. The advancement of the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence has triggered a major shift in the interaction between machines and humans. Intelligent human-machine interfaces could be deployed among connected devices, as could virtual reality and augmented reality technologies, in order to enhance efficiency. The potential for blending these technologies is tremendous; examples of related application areas include real estate (where property could be “visited” by someone virtually), architecture (where someone could tour a building before its construction), and healthcare (enabling the remote monitoring of patients). However, there are challenges that need to be addressed before mass adoption is possible. The cost of devices needs to become cheaper, for example, and data privacy and protection must be addressed. Human-machine interface technology could also be hampered by the bulky size, price, and compatibility of virtual reality and artificial reality devices. Still, there are exciting possibilities. According to a report published by the trade group GSMA in 2017, about 30% of smartphone owners in Pakistan, Bangladesh, and India had never used the internet on their phones due to a lack of digital literacy; Internet of Things-based human-machine interfaces could help overcome such challenges, by enabling the use of simple human gestures to access digital services.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.39"
"4.308","Future Conflict Domains","","Just over a year after China test fired a missile into the higher level of geo-synchronous orbit (around 30,000 kilometres) in May 2013, the United States declassified details of a similar program and launched two Geosynchronous Space Situational Awareness Program satellites, capable of monitoring the high orbital layer and rendezvousing with other satellites at geo-synchronous level. The key role of space-based communications for modern defence was highlighted by the warning in 2015 from US Air Force Lieutenant General Jay Raymond that “soon every satellite in every orbit will be able to be held at risk”. This militarization of new domains – space, but also the seabed – was a risk identified in the World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Report 2016. With space-based technology becoming critical for a larger proportion of human activity, the unwillingness of military space powers to play by a common set of rules is a potential source of problems. Until recently, the hostility of the Arctic and the deep sea to human life meant that huge expanses of ocean remained outside of any commercial or strategic domain. However, the combination of melting icecaps and the development of more capable artificial intelligence-enabled submersible drones are dramatically expanding the maritime domain. In a speech to the Naval Submarine League Symposium in 2015, director of the US Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program Admiral Frank Caldwell identified the imperative to develop unmanned vehicles in order to innovate new capabilities in undersea warfare. In 2014 the strategy and management consultancy firm Avascent projected a boom in international submarine procurement over the 2014-2024 period, from $6.3 billion to $16 billion. Robot submarines are being developed to crawl along the ocean floor, in order to better map the domain and secure deep-sea fibre-optic cables critical to the functioning of global communications infrastructure. However, the same technology can have commercial applications in mining deep-sea minerals and energy deposits. A similar trend can be seen in cyberspace: in July 2016, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization officially listed cyberspace as an arena for war, placing it alongside the traditional battlegrounds of land, sea and air. In February 2016, US Secretary of Defense Ash Carter told National Public Radio that the US military was deploying cyber tools in the fight against the Islamic State (ISIS). His description of dropping “cyber bombs” on the terrorist group constituted the first public admission of the offensive use of the internet domain by a state. To what extent do the basic rules governing international security –pertaining to sovereignty and the laws of war – apply to these new domains: space, the ocean, the Arctic, and cyber? Until recently, such questions could be settled between the few states wealthy and advanced enough to have access to these domains. However, when it comes to biotechnology and artificial intelligence, the number and types of stakeholders are much more diverse. For instance, a 2015 report in Scientific American explained that compared to the Cold War era, where mutual vulnerability deterred the space powers from extending combat into orbit, the situation today is more complex. Around 60 countries now have satellites in space, and both low- and high-Earth orbits are brimming with scientific and commercial activity. New approaches to governance that take this and the other factors driving the transformation of international security into account are needed.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.83"
"4.309","Future Product Development","","Production systems are at the brink of a new industrial revolution, thanks to a confluence of emerging breakthroughs in mobile connectivity, artificial intelligence, the so-called Internet of Things, next-generation robotics, wearables, genetic engineering, nanotechnology, advanced materials, and biotechnology. The combined swirl of these technologies will transform manufacturing and production systems with unprecedented speed and scope, and will impact economic growth, business models, employment and sustainability. This can result in significant efficiency gains, which represent the promise of the Fourth Industrial Revolution; it is also likely to have a particularly strong influence on the electronics sector. The move towards a more sustainable, circular economy, for example, will involve demand for electronics that can power industrial systems that are restorative and regenerative by design. In addition, a key enabler of the circular economy is the ability to access information about the condition, location, and status of assets, using electronics, in order to help maximize their re-usability and value. Emerging technologies will lead to greater customization, via tools like 3D printing and advanced additive manufacturing, and will spur further innovation in electronics. The industry will need to stay abreast of how these changes are impacting production. One example: tools like 3D printing are now bringing production systems into consumers’ homes.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.45"
"4.310","Future of Energy Demand","","Expanding populations, growing economies, and improving efficiency are all having a fundamental impact on energy demand. Significant change will occur in the next few decades, as the global population is expected to grow from about 7.6 billion to nearly 10 billion by 2050 (per a United Nations estimate), and global GDP is expected to nearly triple by that year (according to a report published by PwC). However, overall energy demand growth has actually been slowing - due to a global shift towards more services-driven economies, and to technology and process improvements that boost both productivity and efficiency. The specific shape of energy demand depends on geographic location. In the year 2000, for example, 40% of global demand was generated in Europe and North America while 20% was generated in developing economies in Asia. By 2040, the situation will be completely reversed - as China becomes by far the biggest energy consumer. This has implications for the production of primary energy, for trade, and for renewables and alternative fuels as countries try to secure their respective energy futures. Even as global energy demand growth slows, total demand is nonetheless expected to increase by more than 25% by 2040. Taking into account current and planned policies, and modelled under the International Energy Agency’s “New Policies Scenario,” an additional $2 trillion in annual investment will be required in new energy supply. Demand for natural gas in particular will likely increase, as a means to deal with the intermittency of renewables and with increasing demand from sectors like aviation, shipping, and petrochemicals. Managing this demand growth while also achieving the Paris Agreement on climate change’s target of limiting warming to less than 2°C above pre-industrial temperatures (especially in light of a more recent, 2018 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report warning about the consequences of just 1.5°C of warming) will require a rethinking of the supply and use of energy. It also calls for better solutions for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions; carbon capture utilization and storage technology will likely have to play a significant role in the global energy system of the future.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.59"
"4.311","Future of Power Systems","","The planning for electricity systems was traditionally done according to investment cycles lasting as long as 60 years. However, this has now changed dramatically. Record levels of new investment are required for developed markets focused on rapid decarbonization, while fast-growing emerging markets must build electricity systems that can support increases in energy consumption per capita. Regardless of the location, the energy “trilemma” - a concurrent need for access and affordability, security, and sustainability - promises to be a source of tension. Developed markets will look to complete their transition to cleaner energy by supplementing renewable capacity with more decentralized generation, energy storage, and smarter digital grids; meanwhile in faster-growing markets, energy investment will be more heavily skewed towards the basic infrastructure needed to one day provide universal access. In order to help close this gap in power access between high- and low-income countries, developing markets will likely invest twice as much in generation capacity as Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development members. The challenges facing electricity systems in need of greater investment vary. In relatively wealthy OECD markets, policy-makers need to maintain popular support for their related objectives, and set up fair, transparent markets capable of attracting the necessary interest. The most dramatic related technological revolution will occur in energy storage - the growing popularity of electric vehicles will be instrumental for driving down storage costs, and ultimately enabling it to replace the thermal capacity that currently backs up (potentially intermittent) renewable energy generation. In non-OECD markets, there will likely be more of an emphasis on developing the right strategic roadmap for electricity systems, and on developing the regulatory frameworks necessary to support unprecedented levels of investment. The biggest challenge for these markets will be to attract the necessary capital by looking beyond domestic sources and tapping global markets. This in turn will likely require a greater number of effective public-private partnerships.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.59"
"4.312","Future of Work","","The Fourth Industrial Revolution is causing business model changes that will significantly disrupt labour markets. New categories of jobs will emerge, as others disappear. According to the World Economic Forum’s 2016 report Future of Jobs, most industries will require new skill sets from their workers, and 7.1 million jobs will be lost between 2015 and 2020 as a result of disruption. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reported in 2016 that a 20th century bias for skilled, rather than unskilled human workers has evolved into a complete replacement of workers with computers.  The OECD pointed out that even mid-level jobs that require some skill tend to be routine-based, and thus potentially automated. This deletion of mid-level jobs, combined with an expansion of low-skilled service positions, and heightened demand for high-skilled workers, is leading to increased social polarization. According to a 2016 report from the International Labour Organization, 200 million people were unemployed globally at that time, and more than 300 million additional jobs were needed by 2020 in order to provide a livelihood for the next generation of workers.  In a 2013 paper, Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne of the University of Oxford estimated that in the course of the next decade or two, nearly half of all occupations may be affected by automation and technology. New approaches to job creation and skills development, in both the private and public sectors, are therefore urgently needed.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.78"
"4.313","Future of Work in the US","","New ways of work in the so-called knowledge economy, and the rise of automation, portend a period of profound change for the US labour market. Increasingly diverse technology skills are required of US workers, in order to remain globally competitive. In addition, questions about the impact of new immigration and education policies on the workforce have emerged during the Donald Trump presidency. Just a few decades ago, a job in the US could easily mean a lifelong career with one employer, performing different versions of one role. The increasing integration of technology into the workplace - for both high- and low-skilled jobs - means an American worker may now potentially hold multiple jobs involving diverse skills over the span of a career. This evolution calls for greater flexibility, more training and broader skill sets. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, by 2015, 15 million Americans were self-employed, or 10% of the entire US workforce. The Ubers and Airbnbs of the US sharing economy, for example, have disrupted the taxi and hotel industries, and altered the traditional relationship between employees and employers. The Fourth Industrial Revolution will feature many examples of new, disruptive business models that quickly emerge. The implications of this are significant. Increasingly prevalent technology will impact not just manufacturing workers and lower-level service employees, but also mid-level, highly-skilled professionals. Basic legal work, for example, is already being bundled and outsourced, eliminating the need for law firms to hire junior associates and paralegals, while news is increasingly being aggregated rather than produced through traditional reporting, and so-called Massive Online Open Courses, or MOOCs, may displace a significant number of college professors. According to a 2015 Pew Research Center poll, 65% of Americans anticipated that within 50 years robots and computers would “definitely” or “probably” take over most work previously performed by humans. US policy-makers will need to consider how best to regulate this new economy, where workers may have greater flexibility but less stability.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.130"
"4.314","Gender Dynamics of Future Jobs","","As the Fourth Industrial Revolution takes hold, it will affect female and male workers in distinct ways. Adequately preparing to adapt to related, disruptive changes will include tackling gender gaps - which could in turn unlock new growth opportunities for companies. Household work, for example, could be further automated, and relieve some of the current dual burden for working women. Changes to what have traditionally been men’s roles are also likely to reshape the division of labour at home, and a more holistic approach could be taken to workforce planning. Harnessed in the right way, new, more flexible work patterns and other trends could in theory result in a more gender-balanced workplace. However, there is a real risk that disruptive change impacting business models, and generating a labour market where jobs are being displaced, could actually worsen existing gender inequalities. The World Economic Forum’s 2018 edition of its report The Future of Jobs found that gender parity is one of the top trends driving growth in industries including mining and metals, and oil and gas. The oil and gas industry in particular has suffered from a serious gender imbalance in both its junior and senior ranks. According to a report published by the consultancy BCG in collaboration with the World Petroleum Council in 2017, women represent roughly one fifth of the industry’s workforce, which is a significantly smaller share than any other sector, and women have a very limited presence in both technical roles (often considered prerequisites for career advancement) and in senior management. In 2018, Bloomberg Businessweek published data showing that among 157 publicly-traded oil and gas companies in North America and western Europe, three had female CEOs, and 12 had female CFOs. Other sectors with high gender imbalances include architecture and engineering, and manufacturing and production. The technology industry, which has enjoyed tremendous growth and is often perceived as forward-looking, is also home to significant gender imbalances. According to data published by the World Economic Forum in 2017, both Microsoft and Google had total workforces that were less than one third female, while women held 24% of the leadership roles at Google, and 18% of the leadership roles at Microsoft. Facebook and Twitter, which were founded more recently, also had imbalances; 30% of the leadership roles at Twitter were held by women, and the figure was 27% for Facebook.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.63"
"4.315","Gender Gap","","Chile does not make good use of its available talent. The country has a relatively high level of female educational attainment, with more women than men enrolled in secondary and post-secondary (colleges and universities) programs. However, the country’s level of female economic participation and opportunity ranked 119th out of the 144 countries measured in the World Economic Forum’s 2017 Global Gender Gap Report. Chile’s failure to reap a return from its investment in female education is due to unaddressed cultural, structural and workplace factors: a lack of access to quality care facilities; traditional attitudes towards family and household roles; one of the widest gender wage gaps in the world (31.7% as of 2016, according to the National Statistics Institute of Chile); women’s limited presence in more productive sectors of the economy; and their underrepresentation in decision-making roles at firms including the biggest publicly-traded companies in the country. While they have advanced considerably in recent decades in terms of asserting themselves in the public space in Chile, women have largely maintained a primary caretaking role within families. A more modern labour code that emphasizes co-responsibility for family caretaking could create more opportunities for women, by encouraging their recruitment and job development. A greater prominence for women in the sciences, on corporate boards, and in politics could help prevent the gender biases that develop during early childhood and later impact the professional world. Greater female economic participation could also boost economic growth; a 2016 study by Chile’s Ministry of Economy estimated that for every additional 100,000 women entering the labour market, GDP would increase by an average of 0.65 percentage points. Chile’s government has focused on initiatives designed to reduce gender inequality, though a broader focus on this issue is necessary. Some related efforts worth highlighting include the creation of a Ministry of Women and Gender Equality in 2016, the development of programmes that encourage female labour participation through training and entrepreneurship, the establishment of a goal to attain 40% female participation on executive boards at public companies, and new regulation that promotes diversity. In order to accelerate the pace of change, the Chilean government has sought to foster collaboration between the public and private sectors. One example is a Gender Parity Task Force, launched in 2016 and supported by the World Economic Forum, the Inter-American Development Bank, the civil society organization ComunidadMujer and more than 80 companies. The task force seeks to increase the number of women entering the labour force, and the number of women progressing into management and senior leadership roles, to narrow the gender wage gap, and to raise awareness of the pragmatic business case that can be made for economic gender parity.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.29"
"4.316","Gender Norms and Roles","","The intersection of gender and religion can be controversial. While religion is often viewed as the source of traditional, “backward” attitudes related to gender, the reality is more complex. Many religiously affiliated organizations, for example, are working to improve gender-related development issues. In addition, women often have more influence on religious practices and gender-related standards than is generally recognized. Many development and humanitarian organizations recognize the importance of focusing particular attention on women and girls, by engaging in efforts to increase female access to education, employment, healthcare, and political and business decision-making. While many such efforts are led by religiously affiliated development organizations, this area of work remains problematic, as the role of religion in shaping gender roles is often viewed with suspicion by secular actors. Patriarchy is certainly an element of some religious traditions, though many traditions have women and men working together for gender equality. The diverse perspectives on gender and development issues among religious institutions run the gamut from the ultra-conservative, which seek the preservation of, or return to, ancient traditions and teachings on gender relations, to radical visions of new gender dynamics and relationships for the future. The relationship between secularism, democracy, religion, and gender equality is complex and contested, especially in western countries. In Europe, for example, support for gender equality and the rejection of religious authority have become common markers of identity for many people. Under these conditions, everyone is pressured to demonstrate a certain level of conformity to liberal values, in order to become legitimate, recognized members of national communities. Muslim women, in particular, are caught in the crosshairs of these European identity politics. They are assumed to be victims of patriarchy, expected to embrace western gender roles and dress, and, perhaps most ironically, are often silenced and deprived of influence by the very feminists who purport to defend them. The influence of religion is also evident in the development of women as peacebuilders (examples include the Liberian Women in Peacebuilding Network, which brought Muslim and Christian women together to advocate for peace), and in their leadership roles when it comes to questions of LGBTI (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex) rights - though these roles tend to be highly nuanced.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.115"
"4.317","Gene and Genome Engineering","","As the 20th century drew to a close, biotechnology’s equivalent of Promethean fire appeared: the first detailed sequence of the human genome. Now, the ability to decrypt genetic sequences has empowered us - albeit while creating significant risks. The DNA structure discovered by Watson and Crick in 1953 begat a restriction enzyme that can cleave DNA within seconds, which begat the discovery of biochemical enzymes that process DNA, which begat gene-editing technology that could be used to directly control the expression of intracellular genes within a nucleus. However, it was neither cost-effective nor efficient to manipulate gene expression within the nucleus - a problem solved by the breakthrough discovery of the CRISPR-Cas9 system in the early 21st century. Researchers found that by attaching a specific sequence of guide RNA joined up with a protein called Cas9 to a genome, they could cut and delete (or add) DNA. Soon after its discovery, CRISPR-Cas9 became a global sensation due to its relative ease and compatibility with just about any type of organism. Genome manipulation techniques were eventually discovered that can eradicate or correct erroneous genes, to create recombinant embryos, treat cancer, or prevent infectious diseases. In the near future, gene therapy drugs could be injected, potentially eliminating the need for surgery to avoid genetic defects - such as the procedure the actress Angelina Jolie underwent to address her predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer. Epigenetics, or the study of genetic expression that doesn’t involve changing a DNA sequence, promises future innovation for genome engineering. Epigenetics could eventually enable humans to adapt to, and evolve in, environments such as the atmosphere of Mars. However, genome engineering comes with ethical issues. A Chinese scientist’s successful effort in 2018 to create genetically-engineered babies in order to endow them with a resistance to their father’s HIV infection shocked the scientific community and points to a need for greater global awareness of the perils of genetic engineering technology as a means of artificial reproduction (Chinese officials have since declared that the scientist’s conduct was illegal). Prometheus's gift, after all, had serious repercussions for civilization.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.22"
"4.318","Generational Social Values","","For millennial respondents in the most recent edition of the Global Shapers Survey, a measure of how young people view the world, identity is not about geography, religion, or ethnicity. Instead, most respondents (40.8%) simply saw themselves as “human”; they feel that existing together in the same world, and sharing concerns and desires, serves as more of a unifying force than any easy label. As a group, they are generally concerned about the well-being of others. When asked what would make them feel freer within their respective societies, more than half chose the reply “equal access to opportunities for all.” More than half of respondents said they strongly believe same-sex couples should be able to legally marry, though many young people from the Middle East and North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa strongly disagreed with this idea. One important factor behind the views expressed in the survey was the origin of the respondent. Many of those hailing from countries that score low on the Human Development Index (a measure of well-being based on life expectancy, education, and other factors) do not believe same-sex couples should be able to marry legally, for example, while 77% of respondents from very high HDI-ranked countries strongly believed they should be able to marry legally. Millennials are mostly confident the gender gap will be reduced during their professional lifetime (38.9% “somewhat” agreed with this in the survey, and 25.1% “strongly” agreed). When asked to complete the statement “I would welcome refugees in...,” more than one quarter of survey respondents answered, “my home.” The empathy of young people reminds us all that refugees are human beings in need. Only 7.4% of respondents said they would not welcome refugees in their country, and on a regional basis, young people from North America exhibited an extraordinary degree of openness, with more than 80% indicating they would be comfortable welcoming refugees in their neighbourhood. In terms of staying in touch, nearly 40% of survey respondents said texting or messaging was preferred, though voice calls were the first choice in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, and social networks were preferred in the Middle East and North Africa. Responses were overwhelming to a question about whether young people in general think that the news presented on social media is trustworthy; only 1.3% “strongly” agreed with that idea, while about 22% “somewhat” agreed.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.136"
"4.319","Generational Transition","","Transitioning the leadership and ownership of a family business from one generation to another has typically been a challenging exercise, and is not always well-executed. Successful transitions require a timely letting-go of responsibilities and authority by the senior generation, as successors take charge. Timely transitions help maintain a family’s motivation, and a company’s momentum. Companies and families must empower the next generation of leaders, and develop the resources and talent they need. Historically, this has been a difficult process, and has recently become even more complicated. The difficulty in making timely transitions has been exacerbated, for example, by the increased longevity and active lifespan of the senior generation. The issue is whether this generation decides to remain in place longer as leaders and controlling owners of a family business, or if it instead decides to pass responsibilities and control to the next generation when it is ready. There has also been a change in expectations and interests among younger generations. Members of both Generation X and Generation Y (Millennials) feel ready to assume leadership roles at an earlier age than their predecessors. This dynamic reduces the chance of finding a mutually agreeable period of transition. There is a significant risk that frustrated, next-generation family members will leave the company or lose motivation as members of the senior generation remain in their roles. Businesses are more frequently being disrupted by technological changes, and industries are maturing more quickly. Owners of family companies now need to decide more quickly and more often if they can play the game that their industries require; that is, do they have the capital, talent, and determination to succeed. More family companies will likely fail in the coming decades, in this fast-changing context. Talent, for example, is increasingly a factor in a company’s success, and family companies need both family and non-family wealth creators capable of making important bets on the future. If an owning family becomes incapable of making key decisions for its business, a family company is likely to stall. There is an enormous amount of capital prepared to buy or invest in family companies, held by other firms or private equity funds. A well-run family company could be attractive to these investors. If the transition of a family company to the next generation isn’t feasible, then families, now more than ever before, can decide to sell. This key issue is curated in partnership with John Davis, Founder and Chairman of the Cambridge Institute for Family Enterprise.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.51"
"4.320","Genomics and Mental Health","","Scientists are increasingly looking to genomics - the study of the function and structure of genetic material - in order to better understand the causes of conditions like autism, schizophrenia, mood disorders, and Alzheimer’s disease. Advances in technology have sharply reduced the cost of sequencing a genome in recent years, and now researchers must figure out how to best acquire, store, analyse, and distribute a growing amount of valuable information. Researchers have estimated that the computing resources needed to adequately handle genome data will exceed that required to run Twitter and YouTube; identifying signals for genetic risk in brain-related disorders requires both enormous amounts of data (made possible only relatively recently by technical advances), and the collaboration of a large community of scientists from around the world. In order to continue to advance our understanding of the relationship between genes and clinical traits, scientists need to gain increasingly accurate descriptions of symptoms, treatment outcomes, physiology, and behaviour. In recent decades, there has also been mounting interest in using imaging technology to visualize the brain - with the aim of identifying biomarkers (physical indicators of a disease state) that can help accurately predict a person’s risk of disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, addiction, schizophrenia, and other conditions. As with genomics, the challenges involved in imaging are significant; identifying meaningful signals that may indicate risk through the noise of the normal variation of human brain development and function can be daunting. For both genetics and imaging, cloud computing is easing the difficulty of storing and sharing the enormous amount of data required. Until relatively recently, it was a real challenge to be able to store and transfer just a few genomes, which sometimes required the physical delivery of hard drives. Now, cloud computing and on-demand delivery and pricing can make it a routine task for scientists to access huge datasets - securely, and collaboratively. The results of a 2017 survey of hospitals, academic medical centres, and other healthcare-related respondents published by the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society showed that 65% reported using the cloud or cloud services, with much of that use focused on clinical application and data hosting, and data recovery and backup.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.95"
"4.321","Geo-strategic Competition","","In terms of economic capacity and military capabilities, the gap separating the leading global power from the rest is narrowing as rising powers steadily convert demographic dividends and cultural confidence into economic strength and strategic influence. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, global military expenditure, which showed a brief decline in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, has now resumed its upward course. Spending continues to fall in North America, Western Europe, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, but is rising sharply in Central and Eastern Europe, Asia and Oceania and in the Middle East, reflecting a general shift of capability to the east. In spite of international sanctions, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is rapidly establishing advanced nuclear weapons capabilities.  The return of strategic competition between strong states with conflicting interests was identified in the World Economic Forum Global Risks Report 2016. Since the report was published, the trend of strategic competition has been confirmed by open expressions of suspicion. The US 2017 Defense Posture Statement identified the task of deterring Russian aggression in Europe as the principal challenge driving defence planning. The October 2016 Pew Research Center Survey of Global Attitudes found that the Chinese public named US power and influence as the top international threat facing the country. Also in October 2016, the Russian Federation Foreign Minister highlighted increasing US hostility towards Moscow, and complained about a series of aggressive US steps that threatened the country’s national security. A sharper sense of rivalry can also be seen at the regional level. As John Chipman, Chairman of the International Institute of Security Studies, wrote in the September 2016 Harvard Business Review, “ A second trend identified in the Global Risks Report 2016 is the relationship of geo-economics and international security. Economic policies continue to be “weaponized” through sanctions. Businesses encounter more obstructions as a result of anxieties around trade, technology transfer and intellectual property, calling into question the reliability of global supply chains, industrial partnerships and crossholdings. This power shift challenges norms of global leadership and institutions of global governance.  Advocates of United Nations Security Council reform such as Indian President Narendra Modi warn that unless these institutions adjust to the changing world, they risk becoming irrelevant. Meanwhile, the demand for wider power-sharing arrangements is reflected in the emergence of the G20 in parallel with the G7. Also in terms of finance, the BRICS New Development Bank and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank now sit alongside the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.83"
"4.322","Geopolitical Shifts","","The Arab uprisings of 2011 spurred political transformation that is still unfolding across the Middle East and North Africa region. Syria continues to be plagued by civil war, and split into areas controlled by various factions. In Iraq, the government has restored sovereignty over territory previously controlled by the Islamic State, though the country remains split along ethnic and religious lines. Libya meanwhile suffers from a high degree of polarization, while Yemen was transformed into a theatre of confrontation by a Saudi-led campaign targeting a rebel group with ties to Iran: Ansar Allah (also known as the Houthis). In addition, the refugee crisis has had a profound impact on regional stability. Prompted by economic hardship, widespread violence, sectarian persecution, and climate change, migrant flows remain high. The number of internally displaced persons in Libya was more than 193,000 as of late 2018, and nearly 1.9 million in Iraq, according to figures published by the International Organization for Migration. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, there were roughly 5.6 million registered Syrian refugees as of late 2018. The migrant flows from Syria have strained infrastructure and public services in neighbouring countries, tested the resilience of host communities, and led to more heated competition for limited resources. These geopolitical developments are affected by Western actors, but have led to greater regional influence for both Iran and Saudi Arabia; the countries’ regional struggle is the current defining feature of this part of the world. US disengagement from the region stemming from that country’s experiences in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya is likely to continue, if the so-called shale gas revolution makes the US increasingly less reliant on energy imports. In addition, for the European Union, a post-Arab Spring fervour for democratic progress has been replaced by a security-focused approach, particularly in light of the effects of the migrant crisis. As local responsibility shifts to countries within the region, Saudi Arabia has positioned itself as a key player through its partnership with Egypt, while Iran’s clout also remains significant in the context of the crises in Iraq and Syria. Meanwhile Qatar remains embroiled in the ongoing contest between the two.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","['1.97', '1.117']"
"4.323","Geopolitical Tensions","","A nuclear non-proliferation success story suffered a critical setback in May 2018, when President Donald Trump fulfilled a campaign promise to pull the US out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal - which limits Iran’s ability to enrich uranium, and enables closer monitoring of its nuclear activities, in exchange for greater access to global trade and investment. It is unclear whether the deal will survive among remaining parties. The European Union, for example, has sought to find ways to preserve an arrangement whereby Iran could continue to export oil, and European banks could continue to operate in the country. However, the Trump administration has also re-introduced sweeping sanctions on Iran, which promise to hinder the country’s economic ties to most third countries. The deal’s failure would have wide-ranging implications for regional dynamics in the Middle East, for the EU’s relations with the United States, and for efforts to conclude a similar agreement with North Korea. It could also fuel the already expanding roles played by China and the Russian Federation in international security. As the US turned away from the Iran deal, it focused on nuclear disarmament in North Korea. North Korea has expressed a reluctance to denuclearize in exchange for economic benefits, though a June 2018 meeting between Trump and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un seemed to raise the possibility of an agreement. The unravelling of the Iran deal illustrates how quickly such pacts can fall apart, however, creating potentially dangerous knock-on regional effects; analysts have long feared a nuclear arms race between Iran and Saudi Arabia, for example. In terms of existing nuclear agreements of note, in 2011, the US and Russia implemented an accord that curbed their respective numbers of strategic warheads, launchers and heavy bombers - though it is scheduled to expire in 2021. The issue of tactical nuclear weapons in Europe has meanwhile been sidelined, though a review commissioned by the German Parliament in 2017 found that the country could begin financing nuclear weapons programs in the United Kingdom and France, amid growing sentiment that the EU cannot rely on US security assurances. In the absence of progress on effective non-proliferation policies, a new nuclear arms race is possible. Deteriorating relations between the West and the Russian Federation, and rising tensions in the Middle East as well as between India and Pakistan, are all related causes for concern.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.102"
"4.324","Geopolitical and Geo-economic Recalibration","","Despite fractures opened in its relations with the West in recent years, the Russian Federation can take a leadership role in helping to address international issues. The Russian economy is still being hit by sanctions first imposed by the US and other Western countries in 2014, as a result of conflict in Ukraine. This has aggravated other geo-economic challenges, including relatively low oil prices - though the price of oil recovered in 2018. Capital flows into the Russian Federation remain unpredictable, as business leaders ponder how long political tensions with the West will linger, and how quickly relations with Asia can grow stronger. Prior to Donald Trump’s election as president, some predicted a new era of cooperation between Russia and the US. However, the Trump Administration issued fresh sanctions against the Russian Federation in 2018, for alleged cyberattacks and interference in the 2016 US presidential election. The US also expelled Russians identified as intelligence agents, in response to the Russian Federation’s alleged poisoning of a former Russian spy in the United Kingdom. Relations between the Russian Federation and Turkey have meanwhile improved, as the countries have increased coordination on efforts to deal with the ongoing conflict in Syria, where the US has armed Kurdish groups; Russia and Turkey have hosted related peace talks. Iran remains an important partner for Russia in terms of coordinating efforts in Syria and the broader Middle East. The Russian Federation has supported the international nuclear accord with Iran, though the US pulled out of the deal in May 2018 - and announced plans to renew sanctions against Iran.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.116"
"4.325","German Economy and Public Finances","","Two factors have been crucial for the stability of the German economy in recent history: the investment in infrastructure and modernization following the reunification of East and West Germany that fuelled growth and productivity in the 1990s; and a relatively low-wage workforce both from the former East Germany and other Central and Eastern European countries. Germany increased its federal minimum wage in 2017 to 8.84 euros per hour from 8.50 euros per hour, though that still trailed minimum wage levels in France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Ireland, and Belgium. Overall, Germany ranked sixth among European Union countries in terms of private sector wages in 2017, and its employers paid 6% less than in France that year, according to data published by the German Federal Statistical Office. In terms of non-wage labour costs, such as pension and insurance contributions, Germany ranked 13th among EU countries, according to Statistical Office data. Germany has a working age population that fell to 65% of the total by 2014 from about 70% in 1990, according to OECD data, and has made potentially costly political decisions such as its effort to proactively transition to renewable energy. Still, Germany’s economy ranked 3rd out of 140 countries in the World Economic Forum’s 2018 Global Competitiveness Index, up from 5th in 2017, and the country has enjoyed its lowest unemployment rate in decades. Germany ranked 1st globally for innovation in the Forum’s index, 2nd in terms of business dynamism, but only 31st in terms of information and communications technology adoption. Overall, the country’s GDP grew by 1.8% in 2018, below the European Commission’s forecast 2.3% - though this still resulted in a budget surplus and lower levels of public debt. According a constitutional amendment introduced in 2009 (the “Schuldenbremse,” or “debt brake”), the German government is prohibited from running a structural deficit larger than 0.35% of GDP until 2020, and no structural deficit is permitted at all after that point. While this has contributed to solid public finances, some economists have deemed the policy to be counterproductive. That is because forward-looking public investment made now in digitalization, education, and the integration of newly-arrived immigrants could help solidify Germany’s long-term competitiveness.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.66"
"4.326","Giving Money, Not Stuff","","Planes, trucks, and tents are often what people imagine when they think about humanitarian aid. But from Indonesia to Yemen, people in need are increasingly receiving aid from an ATM or mobile phone. A number of studies have found that sending cash is better than sending stuff; it’s cheaper, more versatile, and more respectful. Donors and big aid agencies have committed to supplying more help in the form of cash. In 2016, cash transfers and vouchers increased by 2.5% compared with the year earlier, to $2.8 billion - or 10% of all international humanitarian aid. The international non-governmental organization World Vision, for example, expects fully half of its spending to be in the form of cash by 2020. Cash aid offers a practical solution for buying goods or renting a place to stay, and injects funds directly into local economies (though health care, counselling, and education can remain elusive, as commercial service providers are rarely an option in crisis zones). In practice, cash aid requires monitoring, and advisory and protective services, especially for those liable to fall through the cracks. As the provision of unconditional cash aid grows in scale, United Nations agencies and NGOs are having to redefine their purpose. Cash threatens the traditional “business model” of many aid groups, because a highly-specialized agency focused on supplying food or shelter, for example, makes little sense for families accustomed to making their own purchasing decisions. On the flip side, greater giving in cash means financial service providers are taking on a more significant role - alongside a percentage of the money transferred. In Turkey, for example, the European Commission provides cash transfers for 1.3 million Syrian refugees, in collaboration with the Turkish government, state-owned Halkbank, the Red Crescent, and the UN (their two-year contract is worth €650 million). Why not cash should be the first question asked before starting any aid project, according to a study published by United Kingdom-based think tank the Overseas Development Institute in 2015. Yet, institutional and technical hurdles remain, some based on misperceptions. For example, cash aid is not actually more exposed to fraud than boxes filled with goods and provisions. And, fears that recipients will spend cash unwisely - say, on tobacco or alcohol - have proven to be unfounded.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.74"
"4.327","Global Development","","While there is growing awareness that religion is a factor to be reckoned with when it comes to tackling environmental challenges, peacebuilding, improving education, and supporting economic growth, there is still a general lack of knowledge about the practical contributions of religious actors across the spectrum to international development work. This applies to the impact of beliefs and behaviour on development, and to the particular ways in which religion and religious actors factor into key development sectors. Education-related goals are at the centre of the global development agenda, though they tend to deal glancingly with religious dimensions, if at all. Religious institutions, however, play significant roles in national and international education systems and approaches; religiously affiliated schools fill critical gaps in rural areas, and in nations with underdeveloped government infrastructure, for example. However, Christian schools in particular have also been associated with colonization, and have often contributed to the marginalizing of Islamic and other minority communities, creating parallel and unequal systems. Islamic schools have meanwhile played an enormous role in providing education globally, but they have become a political flashpoint because they are (often unfairly) perceived as standing in the way of social progress in terms of gender equality, and other issues - and are also often viewed as radicalizing influences. Global health is another realm where religious actors provide key sources of aid, but may also contribute to related challenges - particularly if they are not properly recognized and engaged. One example occurred during the most recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa, when international health organizations failed to connect with religious actors and gain their help in suspending traditional burial practices, in order to limit the spread of the disease. The issue of antimicrobial resistance is another area where religious actors play a huge part. They are often on the frontlines of administering healthcare to rural populations around the world, though their lack of training and resources often contributes to the emergence and spread of drug-resistant bacteria. While religion and religious actors play significant roles in global development efforts, they are often absent from the formulation of mainstream development policy and practices. The development of better data, understanding, and engagement with these actors could help to more effectively aid the poorest and most vulnerable communities in the world.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.115"
"4.328","Global Energy Shifts","","Low energy prices can drain financial reserves, significantly curb public spending, and reduce investment across the Middle East and North Africa region. While oil prices recovered during 2018, there is still a need for industrial diversification in Gulf Cooperation Council countries (the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia); calls for greater diversification, made in earnest during oil shocks, have mostly never been acted upon. For energy-importing countries in the MENA region, low prices presented an opportunity for structural and economic reform, as funds formerly earmarked for petroleum subsidies to help people pay for fuel could instead be used for funding things like education and health care. According to the 2015 International Monetary Fund working paper How Large are Global Energy Subsidies?, removing petroleum subsidies in 2013 could have resulted in approximately $1 trillion in total government savings. Egypt, for example, has committed to deep cuts in energy subsidies as part of an austerity program. That could in turn help the government there to apply any resulting financial benefit to broader economic and structural reforms. Arab oil exporters have historically relied on oil revenue to forge a social contract that guarantees public employment; stability has been achieved via subsidies, and free education and medical care. However, this creates an unsustainable fiscal position, and tends to benefit the well-connected at the expense of everyone else. In addition, it can lead to a lack of strategic development of a country’s labour force. Demand for energy within the Middle East is expected to increase by 60% between 2016 and 2035, according the BP Energy Outlook, creating an urgent need for a more diverse energy mix that includes renewables. Egypt has moved ahead on developing solar power installations, while Dubai completed work in 2017 on a 200-Megawatt solar plant that enables the lowest cost per kilowatt-hour for solar energy in the world. Geopolitical instability in the region poses a constant threat to energy supply. For example, the construction of a direct pipeline from Iraq to the Jordanian port of Aqaba was delayed in 2014 and then re-routed due to security concerns. In addition, fighting between rival rebel groups in Libya over oil infrastructure has put that country at risk.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.97"
"4.329","Global Food Systems","","The world’s population is projected to increase from about 7.6 billion as of 2017 to more than 9.7 billion by 2050, according to the United Nations’ World Population Prospects: the 2017 Revision. This increase, coupled with an expanding global middle class that is demanding higher-quality food, will require a near doubling of current food production levels, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, or FAO. As global food systems become increasingly interconnected, effective coordination among a diverse set of stakeholders will be required. There are significant inefficiencies in food systems. About one third of all the food produced in the world is lost or wasted post-harvest, according to the FAO, while about 815 million people the world remain chronically undernourished. A lack of storage and infrastructure, and a dearth of market information for small farmers, are key reasons for food losses that occur before goods can reach consumers. The potential to craft new, systemic approaches to food systems that include a diverse array of stakeholders presents opportunities to help sustainably feed the world well into the future. One related effort, a US government program called Feed the Future, has appealed to businesses and universities to get involved; according to Feed the Future, it has enabled more than 3 million children to live free from stunting, and helped farmers to generate more than $10 billion in new agricultural sales between 2011 and 2017.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.9"
"4.330","Global Governance and Regulation","","Travel and tourism are vital for the global economy, not least because of contributions from the dominant mode of international transport: aviation. Yet, despite the importance of international aviation, the airline sector has historically been segregated from broader international trade talks by antiquated, protectionist restrictions that remain relatively unnoticed and unchallenged. While the travel industry as a whole has undergone a wave of market liberalization that has benefitted travellers in terms pricing and services, restrictions on foreign investment in airlines have remained largely unchanged since the middle of the previous century. Under existing “nationality” rules, for example, most of the world’s airlines are severely restricted in terms of their ability to sell equity shares, seek out investors, and merge with other airlines. These restrictions increase the cost of capital for airlines, lead to higher prices for travellers, and reduce demand for travel services. This remains the case even as the aviation industry has evolved from a mix of national transportation systems into a complex global network fuelled by technological advances and globalization.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.16"
"4.331","Global Health Governance","","Historically, the government coalitions and non-governmental organizations that have sought to address global health challenges such as pandemics have been primarily motivated by foreign policy interests. However, organizations and initiatives have emerged that take a novel approach to focusing on global health issues. These entities incorporate novel, multi-stakeholder governance structures, and innovative financing models. Their ranks include Gavi, which was created in 2000 in order to combine public and private sector efforts to expand access to new and under-used vaccines for children in poor countries. Gavi estimates that it has helped to prevent more than 10 million future deaths since its inception, and has immunized more than 690 million children - including 65 million children in 2017 alone. According to a study published in the journal Health Affairs in 2016, for every $1 spent on immunization, $18 is saved in terms of healthcare costs, lost wages, and lost productivity due to illness. Gavi’s partners include Merck, GlaxoSmithKline, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which pledged an initial $750 million to set up the alliance in 1999. In addition, groups such as the Global Fund for HIV, Tuberculosis and Malaria and Unitaid have helped to boost participation across sectors, and helped generate sustainable private funding for programs in order to establish viable revenue streams. The rise of new, multi-stakeholder governance models and innovative financing calls for similarly novel approaches to accountability and transparency. As noted in an article published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2013, the world faces threats that are difficult to address due to inequality and significant social, cultural, and political differences. To that end, the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, adopted in 2015 in order to guide global development through 2030, are central to the future of global health governance - and must be better supported through continued innovation in financing, micro-level programming within communities, and the harnessing of big data in order to increase efficacy. Sustainable Development Goal 3, Good Health and Well-Being, includes targets such as reducing premature deaths due to non-communicable diseases (such as cancers and diabetes) by one third by 2030. According to a UN progress report published in 2017, the decline in premature deaths from cancer, diabetes and other diseases was not occurring rapidly enough to meet the 2030 target.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","['1.61', '1.69']"
"4.332","Global Leadership and National Security","","Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been assertive on the international stage, and in 2016 the country hosted the G7 summit, which covered issues including security in the South China Sea. Prime Minister Abe has also advanced what has been dubbed the “Free and Open Indo-Pacific Strategy,” to improve connections between regions in Asia and Africa in order to bolster peace, stability and prosperity. Compared with China, Japan’s engagement with developing markets has been relatively limited. However, Japan has identified ways to better position itself for global leadership, and to that end in 2016 the country pledged $30 billion for infrastructure, healthcare, and education development in Africa. Japan's security strategy, which involves limited self defense together with a strong alliance with the US, relies on its American ally remaining strategically powerful and politically committed to preserving the regional and global status quo. Prime Minister Abe, whose coalition won a landslide election victory in 2017, appears to have formed a relatively strong relationship with US President Donald Trump. However, ties between the countries have been tested by the rising power and assertiveness of China, and the nuclear threat posed by North Korea. Trump’s questioning of the US's traditional alliances may align with Abe's long-held ambition to revise his country’s pacifist constitution, and further expand the role of military. However, Japanese public opinion still generally favours a pacifist identity. Meanwhile Japan's neighbours, especially in China and on the Korean Peninsula, harbour memories of 20th century Japanese aggression, and are mindful of the role that the US-Japan alliance plays in restraining Tokyo’s unilateral impulses.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.88"
"4.333","Global Middle Class Consumers","","As market-based, for-profit production expands into new regions, an expanding global middle class is emerging. While some economists identify members of this global middle class by their ability to purchase a car, the United Nations and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development define membership by the ability to spend, earn, or purchase between $10 and $100 per day. Regardless of how it is defined, the global middle class is clearly making a significant contribution to the global economy. According to a working paper published by the OECD, as recently as 2000 China accounted for just 1% of global car sales, while by 2010 that figure was on track to reach 13%; and while General Motors sold ten cars in the US for every one car in China as of 2005, that ratio was approaching one to one just five years later, according to the report. The mobile phone market tells a similar story - in the second quarter of 2018, Chinese device maker Huawei, which controls nearly one third of China’s smartphone market, surpassed Apple to capture the second-biggest global market share, according to a report published by IDC. Companies and retailers have much to gain from tapping into this expanding global middle class. Research has shown that consumers tend to remain loyal to the brands that they adopt early, and that brands that capitalize on their “initial consideration” can remain successful for decades to come. While in-store experiences and word-of-mouth play bigger roles in emerging markets, middle class consumers in developed countries are asking new questions about to what extent their consumer experiences reflect and enhance the quality of their lives. Some research suggests that economic development and happiness are often at odds. Known as the Easterlin paradox, named for the economics professor who first advanced this theory in 1974, it holds that increased economic options actually hinder the quality of life. As Easterlin himself has indicated in subsequent studies, China is perhaps most emblematic of his theory - as the emergence of a free market in that country since 1990 has occurred in tandem with a declining feeling of individual well-being among the population. The emergence of a global middle class consumer must therefore be accompanied by a consideration of important questions about how we all should best measure personal success.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.114"
"4.334","Global Multipolarity and Regionalization","","In recent years, national and regional priorities have generally overshadowed global interests. The Russian Federation has grown closer to Asia, as the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) has advanced regional integration, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation has expanded its membership and reach, and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank has launched its first investment projects. Now, concern is growing about whether regional integration is coming at the expense of global frameworks. The EEU, comprised of the Russian Federation, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan, has signed a free trade agreement with Viet Nam - while dozens of other such agreements are under consideration, with countries including Egypt, Iran and Israel. In addition, expanded partnerships with regional organizations, including the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), have translated into benefits for the EEU. Chinese-Russian bilateral relations, meanwhile, are growing beyond energy agreements. The countries are cooperating on digital issues, in particular the quest for a more multi-polar internet governance structure. Chinese hardware providers are flourishing in the Russian Federation at the expense of Western companies, while China’s massive Belt and Road infrastructure initiative has involved Russia serving as a key partner in the building of roads, railroads, internet cables, and other telecommunications infrastructure.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.116"
"4.335","Global Trade Architecture","","The Trump administration's wide-ranging criticisms of international trade norms and institutions has affected the global agenda. US efforts to block the replacement of appellate judges at the World Trade Organization, for example, threaten the survival of its independent, third-party dispute settlement system - and no related breakthrough is expected anytime soon. When it comes to preferential trade agreements, a number of significant new deals have moved ahead, including the European Union’s Economic Partnership Agreement with Japan (which entered into force in early 2019), and the EU-Canada Comprehensive Trade Agreement (which entered into force provisionally in 2017). In addition, the African Continental Free Trade Area entered into force in summer 2019, as a means to create a single common market for the African continent. Meanwhile the US redesign of its existing trade deals continues; efforts are underway to ratify the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement in all three countries as a replacement for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), for example. The US is also in ongoing trade negotiations with the EU and China - with most attention focused on the tensions underlying its efforts to seal a deal with China. The US has increased tariffs on Chinese goods in order to pressure China into speeding up trade talks and making concessions, while China has responded by raising additional tariffs of its own. The conflict has moved on to non-tariff measures, too. For example, the Trump administration has placed Chinese telecom giant Huawei on a trade blacklist restricting its ability to use American suppliers, based on national security concerns (Huawei has denied that it presents a security risk). Meanwhile, in Europe, the parliament of the United Kingdom has failed to accept a negotiated deal for future trade talks with the EU as part of a broader Brexit agreement. This has not only weakened the UK’s traditional political parties (as witnessed in the 2019 European Parliament elections and in the resignation of Theresa May as Prime Minister), but has also led to insecurity for financial investors and companies as the odds of a “hard” Brexit increase. These trade-related sources of global tension have a significant impact on financial markets around the world, and have sparked a fresh round of debate on the merits of globalization.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.84"
"4.336","Global Trade and Production","","As new markets develop, old markets adapt - and many industries have uprooted production from one location to another. According to recent World Bank data, some of the most popular destinations for offshore manufacturing now include Viet Nam and Cambodia. Meanwhile formerly low-cost locations are finding new competitive advantages; for example, every second industrial robot made is now being shipped to China. In contrast to the quickened pace of production within many regions, overall productivity growth has slowed in in recent years. In public remarks delivered in 2017, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde warned that another decade of weak productivity growth would seriously undermine global living standards and social stability. Reasons she cited for weak growth in recent years included trade restrictions and a failure to foster entrepreneurship. As they seek to reinvigorate productivity, developed countries are increasingly bringing manufacturing back from offshore locations. According to the US Reshoring Initiative, 338,000 manufacturing jobs were created in this way in the US between 2010 and 2016. In terms of attracting foreign direct investment, the US remains in the global lead, with China, Germany, and Brazil following. However, there has been an upswing in trade protectionism. In 2018, the US imposed tariffs on billions of dollars in Chinese goods, China responded in kind, and the two superpowers have since been locked into related conflict. Meanwhile the United Kingdom is still finding its way toward leaving the European Union, and it remains unclear what the future relationship between the two prominent trading partners will look like. Other regional shifts include the US, Canada, and Mexico preparing to cooperate under the terms of a new trade agreement expected to replace NAFTA, while the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union is pursuing new forms of free trade cooperation with China and Iran, and the African Continental Free Trade Area is now a reality as dozens of countries have signed on to what may become the largest free trade area since the foundation of the World Trade Organization.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.3"
"4.337","Global Value Chains","","The declining cost of communicating with partners and subsidiaries, transporting items, and moving them across borders has encouraged companies of all sizes to deploy a series of global steps as they assemble and deliver goods and services. The reshaping of regulations via multilateral institutions like the World Trade Organization and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and via trade agreements, has been an important driver of these global value chains. However, the global value chains in turn pose new policy challenges to these very same institutions and deals - in the areas of sustainability, tax structures, and labour markets. They also raise thorny issues in the context of disruptive trade policies like the US turn to protectionism, and weighty decisions like the Brexit vote. The growing importance of these international supply networks has even prompted some to suggest that trade negotiations should no longer be pegged to a geographic area, and should instead focus on trade along a particular supply chain - which would have negotiators addressing only those goods and services relevant to a single industry sector, such as clean energy or textiles. Global value chains can help facilitate the integration of developing countries into global markets, by enabling them to specialize in services and semi-finished goods rather than entire products. They also provide a means to spread knowledge and standards - and can therefore propagate more sustainable practices (a report published by the United Nations Global Compact in 2015 called supply chains one of the most important levers for business to create positive impact in the world). However, there is a risk that companies will simply opt to route supply chains through areas where sustainability standards are the lowest (it remains unclear whether self-regulation of sustainability standards is sufficient to achieve United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, which were established in 2015 and designed to guide development to 2030). Global value chains may also render national environmental policy less effective, as the environmental impact of a supply chain can be spread across multiple regulatory regimes. There are also concerns about their financial dimensions; value chains have been used to manipulate a company’s tax burden in less-than-equitable ways by targeting specific low-tax geographical areas of the chain in which to report profits, for example.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.84"
"4.338","Globalization","","Global trade was growing at a rate of 8% annually before the 2008 financial crisis; post-recovery, it has slowed significantly. Annual merchandise trade volume increased by just 3% in 2018, and is expected to slow further to 2.6% in 2019, according to the World Trade Organization. Meanwhile nationalist backlash in a number of countries has made global economic governance more difficult and uncertain. The United Kingdom’s planned exit from the European Union is impending, and the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, has been reformulated as the “US-Mexico-Canada-Agreement” by the current US administration - which sharply criticized the World Trade Organization while blocking the re-appointment of a WTO body member in late 2018. These dynamics raise serious questions about the future ability of global institutions, already widely panned by those who feel they have been neglected, to provide assistance to those very same people - by coordinating improved international economic cooperation for the greater good. The United Nations sought to provide a framework for this, by putting forward Sustainable Development Goals in 2015 that include eliminating poverty and making cities inclusive and safe. Subsequent progress reports have found that while satisfactory progress had been made on some goals in some regions, insufficient progress had been made on others. Even in countries that have benefited from globalization, too many have been left behind. The US, for example, has successfully leveraged international trade and found countless overseas markets for its goods, while at the same many of the jobs producing those goods have moved to other countries. The number of manufacturing jobs in the US fell to less than 11.5 million by 2010, from 19.4 million in 1979, according to a report published by the Pew Research Center in 2017. The US is not alone; while global trade has helped to reduce inequality among countries, within countries inequality is increasingly problematic. According to the International Monetary Fund, more than half of the countries in the world have seen an increase in income inequality over the past three decades. While income distribution systems are severely under-performing due to neglect, this is not an inevitable result of capitalism. The insufficient attention paid to those denied the benefits of globalization has contributed to the weakening of the very political consensus that long supported it.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.58"
"4.339","Good Digital Identities","","Proving one’s identity is an essential part of everyday life. It is a prerequisite to vote, open a bank account, buy or rent a home, and access health care. In the analogue world, we rely on physical documents issued by trusted authorities, such as passports or driving licenses. In the digital world, our identities are evolving into a more complex construct - as a web of personal information is provided, collected, and shared across multiple devices and entities. The use of digital identifiers associated with people, devices like mobile phones, or sensors enabling the Internet of Things is poised to increase. This will also increase the volume of personally-identifiable information accessible in the digital realm. By the year 2020, the average internet user will have more than 200 online accounts, according to Dashlane (a company providing password management services). Technologies used for identity verification, from biometrics to distributed ledgers, are increasingly used across industries and regions. Yet, an estimated one billion people still have no formal identity, according to the World Bank, excluding them from effectively participating in society. To date there is no common view on what a “good” digital identity looks like. There are multiple models, from centralized varieties where a single institution controls identity-related data (such as India’s Aadhaar programme), to decentralized solutions that are controlled by users (such as the Maltese government’s system enabling citizens to control access to their education credentials). There are always trade-offs involved - between convenience, security, and privacy, and a government’s need to keep citizens secure while respecting that privacy. There is also a significant amount of fragmentation, and a lack of standardization; technology choices and governance frameworks are being figured out on an industry-by-industry, and country-by-country basis. There are risks involved in identity systems built without adequate safeguards, such as surveillance by totalitarian governments. Competing incentives are also possible, as a business model may rely on personal data monetization while a user may want to remain in control of that data. There are some user-centric principles for digital identities that are widely agreed upon: fit-for-purpose verification (such as passwords, or biometric proofs), inclusiveness, utility and ease of use, user control and choice, privacy, and security. Increased global adoption of these principles will be key for ensuring value for users, and for gaining their trust in the institutions that handle their identifying data.  Priorities for collaboration: Building awareness among policy-makers Creating a shared definition of a “good” digital identity Promoting standards for industries and regions Boosting innovation in privacy, security, interoperability, and user control","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.40"
"4.340","Good Governance in Bangladesh","","Bangladesh’s achievements in terms of socio-economic development have been impressive. Yet, the country has not realized its potential due to a lack of good governance. The contrast between Bangladesh’s macroeconomic performance and its relatively weak governance even has a name: the “Bangladesh Paradox.” If it wants to sustain its growth momentum, the country needs to address this weakness and improve its institutions. According to Transparency International, Bangladesh has been denied economic growth equivalent to 2.4% of GDP because of bribery in its service sector alone. And, the extent of non-performing loans in the country’s financial system (equivalent to about 10% of all outstanding loans), speaks to weak financial management. However, the government has made some related progress; it adopted the National Integrity System in 2012 to improve accountability, while initiatives have been undertaken to improve public procurement through e-procurement and to increase the regulatory power of the Bangladesh Bank. The efficiency of government ministries has also been addressed, and efforts made to improve service delivery and tax administration through modernization programmes and digitalization. Measures are also being put in place to strengthen entities including the country’s Public Service Commission, Securities and Exchange Commission, and Anti-Corruption Commission. However, if Bangladesh is to increase gross investment as a percentage of GDP to 34%, as envisioned in the government’s Seventh Five Year Plan, and to significantly increase foreign direct investment, it requires more predictable policies and supportive regulation. The country also needs to ensure the separation of powers among its executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government, and the parliament (and its standing committees) must more proactively monitor economic performance. Local government institutions need to be vested with adequate power and resources, and the benefits of the digital economy and e-governance tools must be delivered to constituents. The Centre for Policy Dialogue, a Dhaka-based think tank, has proposed setting up a specialized Banking Commission, an Agriculture Commission to improve incentives and ensure fair prices for farmers, and a Statistical Commission to promote data integrity and reliability. An environment where the people have a voice, and the media is able to exercise press freedom, is essential. If Bangladesh is to have an inclusive society based on distributive justice, gender parity, and human rights, it will require demonstrated political will.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.17"
"4.341","Good Governance in Sri Lanka","","Sri Lanka has been pursuing institutional reform in the interest of good governance, following a 26-year civil war that ended in 2009. The 19th Amendment to the constitution, for example, passed in 2015, is meant to trim the powers of the so-called Executive Presidency in force since 1978, and share greater authority with parliament. However, public sector reform has been slow and sporadic, and factors including an entrenched bureaucracy have hindered efforts to improve performance. President Maithripala Sirisena was elected in 2015, and has pledged to crack down on corruption. The Right to Information Act, implemented in 2017, was seen as a vital means to improve government transparency and accountability. However, the government has been dogged by political difficulties, and Sri Lanka has failed to show improvement in Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index; it scored a 38 for 2017, where zero equals highly corrupt and 100 is very clean, compared with a score of 40 in 2012. While the government has set goals of increasing tax revenue to the equivalent of 15% of GDP, and reducing the budget deficit to 4% of GDP, better revenue collection systems and more transparent management of public funds will be required. In 2015, Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Public Enterprise Development was established, with a mandate to restructure state-owned enterprises. There are roughly 250 such enterprises in the country. A number of them regularly incur financial losses, and rely heavily on government subsidies. They operate in areas such as energy and aviation, and often crowd out private investment in these sectors while limiting consumer choice. In 2016, the International Monetary Fund approved a $1.5 billion loan to Sri Lanka, and made the reform of state-owned enterprises a precondition for its assistance. A review published by the IMF in early 2018 noted that progress in reforming state-owned enterprises had been slow, though related financial liabilities had fallen from 13.7% of GDP in 2015 to 11.9% the following year. According to the IMF review, three closely monitored state-owned enterprises, electric utility CEB, Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, and SriLankan Airlines, recorded a combined loss for the first half of 2017 that was equivalent to 0.4% of Sri Lanka’s GDP; the enterprises had reported a combined profit equivalent to 0.2% of GDP for 2016.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.121"
"4.342","Governance Challenges","","The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has enormous entrepreneurial potential. Family-owned conglomerates in the region include Thailand’s Charoen Pokphand Group and Indonesia’s Bakrie Group, while Singapore’s SingTel (Singapore Telecommunications) is an example of a government-linked enterprise, and Viet Nam’s Vinamilk is one of its biggest milk producers. However, creating and maintaining a level-playing field for younger businesses is a major undertaking - albeit a necessary one, if these firms are to be integrated into the global economy. Frequently, it is difficult for smaller firms in the ASEAN region to compete against larger, entrenched rivals. In order for the region to fully develop into an economic powerhouse, regional governments need to better  support small and medium-sized enterprises and so-called micro-entrepreneurs, which together make up at least 89% of all business activity in the region, according to the ASEAN Secretariat. Examples of related government development schemes include productivity improvement grants in Singapore, Indonesia’s Start-up Innovator Program (with support from the Ciputra Group), and the Malaysian Global Innovation & Creativity Centre in Selangor. Widespread corruption is undermining the region’s business environment - and has a particularly hurtful impact on small enterprises. The same resources that enable large firms to compensate for weak regional capital markets also enable them to subvert competition; this can trigger a vicious cycle, as corruption undermines the institutions needed to promote innovation. ASEAN collectively ranks poorly when it comes to corruption (Singapore is a significant exception, according to Transparency International). Brunei Darussalam registered a moderate level of corruption in Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index 2017, while Malaysia, Indonesia, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Myanmar, Lao People’s Democratic Republic (or Laos), the Philippines, and Thailand fared worse. Creating a level playing field for businesses can be made more difficult by political instability. Events in Thailand (civil rights concerns following a 2014 coup), Malaysia (a former prime minister facing charges related to a corruption scandal) and Indonesia (the criminal sentencing of a public official for blasphemy in 2017) point to greater precariousness for governing elites. There have been some encouraging signs in the region: in 2018, Malaysian voters ousted a ruling party that had held power since 1957, and the new prime minister has pledged to root out corruption and re-examine government contracts approved by his predecessor; and Thailand is expected to hold elections in 2019, following five years of military rule.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.2"
"4.343","Governance Mechanisms","","Corporate governance involves establishing mechanisms to align the goals of a company’s executive team with those of owners and other stakeholders (customers, local communities) in the interest of fostering sustainable and long-term development. One of the main mechanisms is the board of directors. It plays a vital role in keeping the executive team both accountable, and on track relative to its stated purpose and long-term goals. There has been a lot of discussion about the most effective structure for a board - which tends to depend on the nature of the organization, its market, and its regulatory environment. For a board to be truly effective it must decide on its optimal size, the independence of its members, the means to assess potential risks, and the renewal process necessary to maintain effectiveness. There has been heated debate about how to add diversity (in terms of both skills and backgrounds) to boards, in the interest of enhancing strategic guidance. Another high-profile topic is incentives, or setting the right type of compensation for top executives in order to encourage long-term decision making that is in line with the organization’s purpose. The compensation debate revolves around not only pay levels but also structure: short-term vs long-term, preferred stock vs. options, performance vesting options as well as discretionary bonuses. Research has shown that setting variable incentives tied to long-term horizons is conducive to long-term profitability, an increase in innovation, and increases in employee and client satisfaction. One key mechanism is the ability of shareholders to engage with management and discuss material matters, and to (most importantly) vote on proposals at annual meetings. Shareholders can include anyone from founding families to institutional investors like pension funds, and a significant share will likely be participating via retirement plans. Shareholder engagement keeps managers on their toes - and while not every form of activism genuinely adds value, making managers respond to shareholder pressure helps them to avoid becoming entrenched and insulated. There has been a marked increase in corporate responsiveness to shareholder pressure related to climate and gender equality issues in recent years, as well as a greater emphasis on long-term strategic plans - reflecting the fact that many shareholders now have longer-term investment horizons.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.36"
"4.344","Governance and Law","","Digital technologies have often outpaced the development of related regulation and legal standards, but blockchain has pushed this dynamic to a new extreme by fundamentally challenging the ways that governments manage economies and make policy, and by potentially altering the underlying framework for providing legal services. Blockchain challenges the very meaning of citizenship, and the ways that public goods have traditionally been delivered. It can enable central governments to devolve power to regions, while retaining stewardship over an overall system. The Dubai Land Department, for example, has developed a blockchain project intended to better share property data among multiple parties, including government entities, and secure related transactions, while Sweden’s land mapping and registration authority has tested using blockchain in order to make recording and transferring land titles more efficient. The effort in Sweden could theoretically eliminate fraud, and reduce the time required to complete transactions from several months to several hours. The use of blockchain in regulatory and legal spheres will have a big impact on multiple industries. In the US, for example, the business of title-insurance, which provides guarantees on property claims that might not be necessary if transactions are securely recorded in an immutable, digital ledger, may be significantly undercut by the expanded use of blockchain. In addition, new accounting practices will become generally required, and new auditing processes will need to be developed - as digital code will need to be audited in the same way that traditional legal contracts and financial documents are currently vetted. New means to manage and handle grievance procedures will also need to be developed, as blockchain has a potentially deep impact on accountancy and law, including on the ways that we think about required education for these professions. The Michigan State University College of Law’s Law School Innovation Index, unveiled in 2017, identified five different law schools in the US offering courses specifically devoted to law as applied to blockchains, cryptocurrencies, and smart contracts. Still, even as the World Bank acknowledged in April 2018 that blockchain has the potential to transform industries including manufacturing and energy, the technology remained too nascent for the organization to be able to make general recommendations on its use for international development.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.24"
"4.345","Governance and Regulation","","When more than 1 million asylum seekers arrived at the European border over the course of 2015, it tested the political bloc’s system of rules and regulations governing migration. That year, the European Commission proposed the European Agenda on Migration, designed to better foster a common asylum policy - and to save lives while securing borders. Globally, there is a recognized need to better manage international migration, both at the international and regional level. As migration patterns become increasingly irregular, related regulation - mostly implemented at a national level - is at risk of failure. In the absence of a coherent international regime, many aspects of the issue remain unevenly addressed; these include labour migration (everything from high-skilled technical workers to domestic migrant workers), family reunification, student migration, tourism, smuggling and human trafficking, refugee protection, and remittances. In 2018, an Intergovernmental Conference involving 164 United Nations member states adopted the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration. The compact was designed to better facilitate safer forms of migration, and provide for better cooperation on international migration in its various guises. It includes nearly two dozen objectives that offer a comprehensive approach, and each objective has several associated actions that could be pursued. The compact recognizes the different migration situations that exist globally, and reaffirms the sovereignty of states over their migration policies. Implementation of the compact, on the part of the private sector, community groups, international organizations, and individual countries, will be critical for achieving its objectives. In the lead-up to the conference that adopted the compact, there was a surge of far-right online activism and negative (at times false) depictions of the agreement and its potential impact. This appeared to be similar to the surge of far-right activism experienced during the European migration crisis in 2015 and 2016, according to research published by the University of Dublin.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.98"
"4.346","Governance in Nigeria","","According to World Bank Governance Indicators, which reflect dozens of data sources, Nigeria scored uniformly in negative territory (indicating poorer outcomes) on measures including “control of corruption” and “rule of law” every year between 2007 and 2017. In the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report for 2018, the country ranked 110th out of 140 countries in terms of budget transparency, and 125th in terms of incidence of corruption. In 2017, the Nigerian government launched an Economic Recovery and Growth Plan to focus on boosting economic growth, investment in human capital, and competitiveness. However, the government has so far struggled to deliver necessary reforms. Clearer focus and direction are now necessary, particularly at a time of when major economies including the US and China are adopting or reinforcing protectionist strategies. Ideally, the government will not only capitalize on the free and fair elections held in 2015, but also on the forthcoming general elections slated for 2019, by initiating enabling policies that jumpstart the economy. More fundamentally, however, Nigeria’s problematic governance reflects its colonial experience; economic resources including land, oil, and gas are still largely under the ownership and management of the government, for example.    There is a widely-held perception that Nigeria’s fight against corruption is being conducted with commitment by two agencies: the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, established in 2003, and the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission, which was established in 2000. While their efforts have been commendable, they might not be sufficient. The country’s legal system in particular (including enforcement mechanisms) requires more robust, determined reform. Barring the resolution of related issues, including those tied to the ownership and management of natural resources, and to general economic and social well-being, the country risks the outbreak of internal conflict. It also risks a failure to redirect resources to areas of serious need; according to a report published by Chatham House in 2017, an estimated $400 billion was stolen from Nigeria’s public accounts between 1960 and 1999, and some $182 billion was lost through illicit financial flows from the country between 2005 and 2014. That misappropriated, common wealth was cumulatively enough to address funding gaps that have contributed to the country’s high maternal mortality rate and lackluster education system, according to the report.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.101"
"4.347","Governance of Nature","","Policy decisions can have a deadly impact on biodiversity. So it is worth carefully considering who, exactly, is in a position to govern the use of land, the oceans, and biodiversity - all of which we rely upon for survival. While the governance of nature was traditionally the domain of governments, a diverse mix of corporate and grassroots groups, along with both supranational and municipal governments, now play prominent roles. This multi-stakeholder governance arose in response to a recognition that complex global issues like biodiversity loss, species extinction, climate change, and the melting of polar permafrost cannot be tackled by national policy alone. In light of increased populism in many parts of the world, it is particularly important that these governing stakeholders now complement rather than compete with each other, in the interest of preserving biodiversity. A single piece of land with a river running through it might represent different things to different stakeholders, for example, based on potentially valuable natural resources like fresh water; while those interests must be accounted for, it must be done in a way that protects and preserves resources. The globalization of natural resources often results in a “tragedy of the commons,” whereby resources are exhausted and accountability for their use does not firmly lie with any single governing group or individual. One example of this is overfishing in the oceans; in regions with lax monitoring and ineffective regulation, fish stocks have been depleted. Off the coast of West Africa, several fish species risk becoming extinct - which in turn threatens entire marine ecosystems and fish-based economies. According to the World Bank, the proportion of fisheries that are fully fished, overfished, depleted, or recovering from overfishing increased to nearly 90% of the total by 2013, from about 60% in the mid-1970s. Additionally, the New Economics Foundation, a think tank, estimates that overfishing is resulting in a loss of more than 100,000 jobs and $4.3 billion annually (the World Bank estimates that exploitative fishing in general costs the global economy at least $80 billion every year). Better public-private cooperation is urgently needed to address related issues, because the way that nature is governed today will determine how much is available tomorrow.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.21"
"4.348","Governing Disruption","","A board of directors has a responsibility to drive the continuous reinvention of an organization - in a way that potentially ensures that it is fit for purpose relative to shifting customer demands and social expectations. Innovation impacts many of a board’s core responsibilities, including long-term planning, people and culture, executive compensation, corporate strategy, investments, and acquisitions. Technological innovation at the core of the Fourth Industrial Revolution now underway is changing the way we live, work, and relate to one another. It not only marks a new chapter in human development enabled by advances that are merging the physical, digital, and biological worlds - it is also forcing the decision-makers guiding organizations to rethink how they can create value and reinvent the ways that they function. While established incumbents are at risk of lacking sensitivity to evolving customer needs, and younger players need the financial resources and data enjoyed by older counterparts, each can gear their corporate governance efforts towards sharing resources in a way that creates value for both parties - and for broader economies.  New collaborative models may require entirely new corporate governance approaches that are much less based on traditional vertical control and siloed mechanisms - while still maintaining accountability to shareholders. The United Nations has emphasized the critical potential for breakthrough innovation to help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, which are designed to enable a more sustainable global economy by 2030. It is a matter of corporate governance to consider how this innovation can both enable sustainable economic growth and help fulfil a specific organization’s purpose. In terms of investor stewardship, for example, shareholders must be engaged on the topic of innovation in order to better understand long-term prospects both for the business and for society as a whole. Some organizations have specific board committees dedicated to technology and innovation, while others bring on consultants or other external advisors. Boards at the most forward-looking companies consider the long-term prospects of a business alongside its internal capabilities - essentially looking into the future, in order to assess whether a company might be impacted by a paradigm shift in technology and business models, and whether there are related opportunities and risks.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.36"
"4.349","Government Innovation","","""Government"" may not be the first thing that comes to mind when one thinks about innovation, but some of the greatest innovations - like space flight and the internet - have only been made possible because governments took risks and provided the resources needed to scale up big ideas. Governments themselves also require innovation. They are generally faced with significant expectations, shrinking budgets, and fragile public trust; adequately responding requires new tools, and entirely new models. Disillusionment has fuelled innovation aimed at making government more representative. Examples of “digital democracy” tools include systems that enable people to receive real-time notifications about issues important to them, new methods of crowdsourcing and collaboration, new means of participatory budgeting, and software that can make online voting secure. Some public-minded innovation draws on diverse pools of knowledge and expertise to solve complex problems. For example, a number of ambulance authorities now use GoodSAM, a mobile system that can alert trained first responders when someone in their vicinity may be suffering cardiac arrest, and also locate the nearest defibrillator. A lot of government innovation is being spurred by new approaches to digitalization, in the form of digital services, smart cities, and open data (made freely available for reuse). Estonia is perhaps a leading example; the country has established secure digital authentication and digital signatures, enabling more online interaction. On a more local level, city governments are weaving the Internet of Things, which ties devices together via internet connection, into the fabric of cities in order to better address hot spots for crime, or to determine where emergency responders should be positioned at different times of day. The London Datastore, a free, publicly-funded data portal, provides datasets to help enterprising members of the public develop solutions for London’s problems; one result is Citymapper, an app that makes use of open data from public transport operators to provide real-time alerts. Meanwhile citizen-generated data is being used by many governments to make processes more efficient. For example, some cities are using information delivered via apps like StreetBump to locate and prioritize potholes for repair. However, government innovation is often stifled by bureaucracy. For that reason, many governments have established dedicated innovation teams designed to overcome the inertia of large public entities and provide space for experimentation.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.80"
"4.350","Government Policy and Consumption","","Government decisions directly impact our ability to buy things. Austerity measures in the United Kingdom, for example, are suppressing incomes and expenditure by about £1,500 per person annually, according to an estimate published in 2019. In addition, central bankers are able to either raise interest rates and restrict the money supply in a way that crimps consumer spending, or to lower interest rates and encourage consumption (some countries have even set negative interest rates in recent years, sharply incentivizing people and banks to buy cars or make loans rather than keep cash on hand). In India, where private consumption accounted for more than 61% of GDP as of late 2018, according to data provider CEIC, faltering economic growth led the Reserve Bank of India to cut rates twice within two months in early 2019. Still, in both India and China savings rates remain relatively high, according to Credit Suisse survey results published in 2019, which can blunt consumer spending. Even among young people between 18 and 29 years of age, savings accounted for 23% of all monthly spending in India, and 29% in China, according to the survey.      While people have relied on governments to occasionally loosen monetary policy and bolster their willingness to take money out of savings and channel it into spending, governments have relied on consumption to draw revenue from value-added taxes, sales taxes, and excise taxes. Governments can use taxes to nudge consumer and corporate behaviour; the US has imposed taxes to correct for the excessive consumption of alcohol and tobacco since 1951, and in 2016 the UK announced a “Soft Drinks Industry Levy” aimed at reducing consumption of the sugar content in soda. In 2018, the UK government said the levy had resulted in more than half of manufacturers reducing the sugar content of drinks. Cross-border tariffs and excise rates can also have a big impact on consumption. As the US and China continue to wage a trade war, it may have a deep impact on global consumption while limiting trade and technology flows. In May 2019, the Trump administration increased tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports from 10% to 25%, affecting more than 5,000 consumer goods and passing on significant additional costs to American shoppers.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.57"
"4.351","Government Role","","Due to government spending cuts, growing investor interest, and a new generation of social entrepreneurs, more governments are experimenting with ways to harness private enterprise for the public good. This is increasingly seen as essential for achieving large-scale, systemic change while reforming public services. However, as neither a conventional business nor a traditional charity, social enterprises blur policy boundaries. Traditional corporate legal structures do not support the dual-purpose business models of social enterprises, and tax systems rarely distinguish between companies that benefit society and the environment and those that harm them. And, while traditional regulation is designed to protect investors from excessive financial risk, it does not recognize that risk can also stem from a desire to create a positive impact. A more innovative public sector could better enable social innovation, by supplying well-designed policy and incentives; governments can also invest directly in social enterprises, act as intermediaries for private investors backing social enterprises, and provide resources and technical assistance (in some countries, issues such as political upheaval and a lack of budgetary support create related obstacles).  One example of positive government support for social innovation is the social impact bond, a financing tool where creditors fund improved social outcomes for underserved communities - which in turn can result in public sector savings. These bonds are contracts signed by local governments, banks, and foundations to do things like help the homeless find shelters, or rehabilitate young criminal offenders. The repayment of related financing depends on how successful a program has been in achieving defined targets, and backers often recycle that repayment back into other projects. The bonds enable governments to partner with innovative service providers and private investors that are willing to assume the upfront costs and risk. Other policy instruments benefitting social innovation include Benefit Corporation and “B Corp” legal statuses, which help for-profit corporations create a public benefit, generate sustainable value, and more carefully measure their impact on society and the environment. Companies operating under these statuses must report to shareholders on how they are balancing interests. Benefit corporation legislation has been passed in more than 30 jurisdictions in the US, while Italy has also adopted related provisions; examples of the thousands of registered benefit corporations include Patagonia and Kickstarter.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.118"
"4.352","Great Power Politics","","Despite being a great power, the European Union has displayed shortcomings when it comes to great power politics. The bloc is based on a Kantian idea that democracies are bound to enjoy relatively peaceful foreign relations, after all; only slowly have member states begun to grasp the power politics now playing out around the world. In reality, there has never been one liberal order, but two. The “thin” liberal order 1.0 was an American project established after World War II, and Europeans added their own liberal order 2.0 after the end of the Cold War - which went beyond borders to consider the rights of individuals. Now, both the American-led security order and the European-inspired legal order are in decline, and no one seems to be lined up as replacements. The US is increasingly retreating from the world stage, while Eurasia is filled with political leaders pulling EU member states in different directions, including Vladimir Putin, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and Xi Jinping. The election of Donald Trump, the first US President in history who does not actively support the EU, has compounded these developments. A nightmare scenario would have Putin’s Russian Federation and Erdogan’s Turkey form an alliance against the EU, in order to weaken its unity. In the Middle East, the EU struggles to make efforts to stabilize the region, and so will continue to deal with repercussions of the instability and poor governance there. When it comes to flexing military might, Germany, the EU’s strongest economic power, currently spends only 1.2% of its GDP on defence - though it has pledged to increase military spending by 8% annually. All European North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member states have agreed to spend 2% of their GDP on defence by 2024, although it is unrealistic to assume this goal will be achieved by everyone. The EU continues to struggle in a world of great power politics partly because it was not built to play that game. Its power has always been soft; the power of leading by example. The original hope was that the EU model would spread, and become universal. This did not happen, partly because the EU became too idiosyncratic for other countries and regional organizations to follow its example. To this day, many in the EU consider great power politics to be a thing of the past. Correcting this misperception will be crucial for the EU’s survival.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.50"
"4.353","Greater Mobility, Bigger Security Risks","","The cross-border movement of people involves risk, and the number of people now on the move is unprecedented. Global international tourist arrivals increased by 6% in 2018 compared with the prior year, to 1.4 billion, according to the United Nations World Tourism Organization. Technological innovation and demographic shifts have combined to create a situation where there is a general expectation for the free and safe movement of people and goods. Yet, geopolitical realities and security shocks like a pair of Boeing 737 Max crashes within six months of each other in late 2018 and early 2019 have put safety and security (both physical and digital) at the top of the agenda. Air travel is actually one of the safest modes of transportation; roughly 1.35 million people die each year in road accidents, mostly in lower income countries, according to the World Health Organization. Nonetheless, airports have been compelled to add new layers of security following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Clear opportunities to use technology and data sharing to further enhance safety and security for air travel and other types of mobility exist. Better collaboration among governments, international institutions, and the private sector would be helpful in this regard. The movement of people within urban areas presents its own set of challenges. A 2014 McKinsey study showed that more than a third of people polled would not consider purchasing a car with internet connectivity due to privacy issues, for example, and more than half were afraid of being hacked through a connected car. Cyber breaches are a real threat and can be hard to detect; the US Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration and FBI have all warned drivers about over-the-internet attacks on cars and trucks. In recent years, efforts to create more sustainable urban mobility have resulted in their own safety issues. The growing popularity of electric scooters as a carbon-free means of navigating crosstown traffic has resulted in sidewalk crowding, legal dust-ups and fatalities; some cities, like San Francisco, were inundated with e-scooters before local legislators had an opportunity to try and regulate their use. In San Francisco, this resulted first in a temporary ban and then in the belated installation of a permitted system that excluded some of the biggest players in the market, including Bird and Lime. Bird, however, proceeded to purchase one of the approved e-scooter providers.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.62"
"4.354","Green Finance","","The green infrastructure sector is a promising investment class. Climate-smart infrastructure will require about $90 trillion in investment over the coming 15 years, most of it in developing and middle-income countries, according to a report published in 2017 by the International Finance Corporation. The World Bank noted in a 2017 report that in the ten years since it had issued its first so-called green bond (debt raised specifically for environmentally-focused investments), it had issued more than $10 billion in green bonds - and that global green bond issuances surpassed $120 billion in 2017 alone. In an environment of relatively slow economic expansion, lowered technology costs, and political interest in infrastructure investment as a means to boost productivity and create jobs, the appeal of sustainable infrastructure may only continue to grow. However, there are some troubling signs; only $10.3 billion had been pledged to the Green Climate Fund (a United Nations program) as of late 2018, for example, short of the $100 billion that was originally agreed to be provided annually by 2020. The continued, healthy expansion of sustainable infrastructure will require a new architecture of public-private investment, supported by overseas development assistance, government spending, and sovereign wealth funds. Much of the growth in green bond issuance has been driven by China, where the Bank of China and the Shanghai-based New Development Bank began issuing their first green bonds in 2016. Investment in renewable energy has actually faltered recently, according to the International Energy Agency; it reported that in 2017, following several years of growth, combined global investment in renewables and energy efficiency declined by 3% compared with the prior year. Investment in renewable power, in particular, declined by 7%, according to the agency, dampened by Chinese policy changes on supporting the deployment of solar technology. Several factors listed in the World Economic Forum’s 2016 Renewable Infrastructure Investment Handbook indicate that opportunities for increased investment in the sector remain. For example, among the top 500 asset owners including foundations, pensions, and endowments, only 0.4% of total assets under management were tied to low-carbon investments, indicating room for expanded interest. Cost may also play a positive role - in June 2016, the International Renewable Energy Agency estimated that the cost of solar may decrease by 59%, offshore wind by 35%, and onshore wind by 26% through 2026.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.48"
"4.355","Growing Inequality","","Recently, increased attention has been paid to growing economic inequality and to its relationship with current models of global governance and economic policy. Much of this attention has focused on the political and economic implications of inequality. Relatedly, inequality has serious implications for the realization of human rights. Two ideas are crucial to understanding the relationship between inequality and rights. The first is the general reorientation of human rights discourse to include a broader range of rights. Theoretical approaches are myriad, but unifying them is the recognition of the importance of social and economic rights to a wider conception of human freedom. These include the rights to education, healthcare and housing. The second is growing appreciation of the consequences of inequality and poverty for human rights. Though the links between inequality and poverty are complex, both factors affect the fulfillment of rights. Moreover, the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals include the elimination of poverty and reduction of inequality. The challenge then is to identify specifically how human rights are affected by growing inequality and to think through the ways that the human rights framework can be built into policy development. This challenge could not be more pressing. As Philip Alston, the United Nations Human Rights Council’s (HRC) Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights, argued in his 2015 Report to the HRC, a human rights framework that does not grapple with the connection between extreme inequality and extreme poverty is doomed to fail. There are a number of potential areas of focus along these lines. To give three: first, tax policy itself is a critical way that states can address economic inequality and protect rights. A comprehensive approach would address internal tax structure but also tax evasion and the presence of tax havens. Second, understanding the links between corruption, inequality, and human rights is crucial. Here, business has a central role to play. And third, the collection and disclosure of reliable data on inequality, disaggregated on the basis of certain markers of disadvantage, is crucial to addressing the problem. It also allows for the development of indicators aimed at measuring progress.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.73"
"4.356","Harnessing the ""4IR""","","The Fourth Industrial Revolution will present environmental challenges; it may also help solve many of the environmental problems wrought by other periods of intense industrialization. This industrial revolution is characterized by new ways of thinking about broader systems, rather than individual technologies - it is also about empowering diverse networks of players rather than relying on top-down decisions, and incorporating humanitarian values. That means that the traditional, top-down approach to environmental governance led by experts is becoming obsolete. Effectively overseeing the oceans, atmosphere, forests, and water will require a new batch of leaders working together in an interdisciplinary way. Collaboration will be essential to help connect environmental expertise to others who have the practical know-how and means to develop, finance, and regulate new technologies. These partnerships could redefine both our understanding of problems, and the range of possible solutions. They may also enable stakeholders to better align, and ensure that promising new technologies and business models are not hindered unnecessarily or cut loose and allowed to operate in a way that is disconnected from community values and interests. Some environmental applications of Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies will have narrow commercial value. Others will be public goods, like the internet, and will enable platforms; these will need to be funded like any public good. New models of public and private financing may be needed, to ensure that both varieties are possible. Satellite-interfacing sensors, satellite imaging, data processing tools, and drone technologies are improving the quality of, and accessibility to environmental data. Initiatives like Global Forest Watch are putting data once only available to universities and researchers into the hands of anyone with a mobile phone, while blockchain holds great potential for carbon trading, managing water allocations, and tracking materials. Smart devices, which know when they need to be repaired, last longer and cut costs. Taken together, these new technologies can help us to better address environmental issues. However, this will largely depend on whether or not environmental data can be effectively democratized, and empower a wide range of people. Greater access could dramatically expand the ranks of engaged actors, and form a new global system of environmental management.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.48"
"4.357","Health","","Ghana’s performance in this area of the Index shows the greatest room for improvement in terms of healthy life expectancy, where it has a progress score (ranging from a poor mark of zero to a top mark of one hundred) of 56.00, resulting in a rank of 111th out of 139 countries.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","['1.67', '1.91']"
"4.358","Health Policy","","Successfully transforming the delivery of healthcare will require evidence-based policies that address access and outcomes, while recognizing the importance of innovation - and the right incentives. A nimble approach is needed, in order to meet current challenges, and those that the future will certainly bring. Because of the increasing inter-connectedness of countries and communities, policy-makers must rethink how nations and organizations prepare for, and work together, to respond to both health emergencies and epidemics, and to the rise in antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Pandemics are now occurring with greater frequency, due to factors including increasing urbanization (the number of city dwellers will increase by 2.5 billion by 2050, according to the United Nations), more frequent global travel (the number of international tourists is expected to reach 1.8 billion by 2030, compared with roughly 25 million in 1950), and to the effects of climate change. Global health policies should be developed that ensure a robust infrastructure is established, in order to meet the next crisis with adequate resources for research and sufficiently brief response times. The HIV/AIDS epidemic provides just one example of how effective global health policies require continued diligence in promoting innovative therapies, supporting patients, and continuing to improve prevention strategies and the monitoring of the spread of disease. In most parts of the world, life expectancy is increasing as a result of better public health measures, nutrition, sanitation, medical practices, and technological innovation. According to the Global Coalition on Aging, the number of people in the world aged 60 or older will reach 1 billion by 2020, and 2 billion by 2050. This will create new demands on systems that are already stretched to capacity as they accommodate populations with diverse health needs including chronic diseases, age-related conditions, and disabilities. Addressing this will require new models of care and payment reform, robust data collection to analyse the outcomes and consequences of novel methods, and structural solutions for workforce development challenges. Alongside issues of capacity are related concerns about pricing and access. While medical advances have the potential to substantially improve health around the world, these benefits can only be truly realized if access is broadly available. Otherwise, disparities will only increase. One potential solution may be alternative payment models, which could serve to alleviate short-term budget issues and ensure availability, while still encouraging new research.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.71"
"4.359","Health and Functional Ability","","As people age, their health is determined by specific diseases, and by a combination of health conditions and the natural impact of ageing on their ability to function. According to the World Health Organization, measuring someone’s functional ability, or the combination of their physical and mental capacities together with their environment, is a stronger measure of overall health than disease states - and the WHO defines “healthy ageing” as maintaining functional ability across the life course. Health becomes more complex with age, in terms of physical and mental capacities (referred to as “intrinsic capacity”), and functioning; one may experience chronic disease, but that does not tell the whole story of one’s health, or the impact it is having on one's life. Certain conditions can be easily controlled with medication, for example, while others may require multiple treatments that lead to side effects. Still others may require corrective tools to perform simple tasks. In addition, so-called multi-morbidity, or experiencing numerous chronic conditions at the same time, can lead to health concerns that traditional disease classifications fail to capture. Despite the potential decline of functional capacity, healthy ageing can still be promoted by maintaining and building intrinsic capacity, and enabling older adults to continue to do the things that are important to them. Addressing conditions once viewed as normal deterioration as we age, such as declines in vision, hearing, and muscle mass, is critical for effective health policy. Preventive action is central to promoting healthy ageing, and caregivers, physicians, and other healthcare professionals share a responsibility to help maintain older adults’ functional abilities. The environments in which we live can also foster healthy ageing, by encouraging social participation. The role of the environment only becomes more important, as capacity declines. Community health services, for example, can promote healthy ageing by providing access to information and services. Assistance with mobility is another aspect of environment that can remove functional barriers. Transportation and infrastructure must become more age-friendly, to ensure mobility for older citizens - and in turn increase social participation, keep older citizens included in activities that bolster commerce, and help expand economies. Declines in functional ability affect us all, at some point. For older people with significant losses of capacity, long-term care systems will be critical for helping older adults everywhere age with the dignity and respect that they deserve.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.7"
"4.360","Health and Wellness","","The world is generally becoming more health-conscious. However, people continue to struggle with hunger, “hidden hunger” (a lack of vitamins and minerals one may not be aware of), and “overnutrition” (obesity). The problem of chronic hunger is growing worse; the estimated number of undernourished people in the world rose to 815 million as of 2016, from 777 million in the prior year, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization’s 2017 report The State of Food Insecurity and Nutrition in the World. The recent increase actually followed a steady decline, according to the report, and reflected worsened situations in sub-Saharan Africa, South-Eastern Asia and Western Asia - particularly in conflict zones affected by drought or floods. Stunting, or impaired growth as a result of poor nutrition, affected 155 million children under the age of five, according to the report, and wasting, or the lack of appropriate weight, affected one out of every 12 children as of 2016. Excessive weight is also a global problem. Childhood obesity is increasing in most regions of the world (41 million children under the age of five were overweight as of 2016), according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization’s report, and adult obesity is increasing everywhere. Non-communicable diseases, driven by risk factors including a poor diet, will lead to a cumulative loss of global economic output equal to $7 trillion between 2011 and 2030, according to a report released by the Harvard School of Public Health and the World Economic Forum. The roles that agriculture and the food and beverage industry can play in addressing health and undernourishment are significant. Through increased coordination and collaboration, there are opportunities to reduce malnutrition and create a positive impact. A number of companies are finding that delivering healthier products makes good business sense. Nestle, for example, created a Health Science unit to develop nutritional products, while sales in general of sugar- and salt-heavy packaged foods have declined. In the US, large sellers of consumer packaged goods (including packaged foods) saw their collective market share decline between 2011 and 2015, while small and mid-sized firms, including healthy food producers like protein bar maker Quest Nutrition, saw their collective market share increase during the same period, according to a report published by the consultancy BCG.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.9"
"4.361","Healthcare Applications and Side Effects","","Before the widespread release of commercial virtual reality (VR) headsets in the mid-2010s targeting mainly gaming and cinephile audiences, VR had been extensively used for a couple of decades in a wide range of medical applications, from healthcare training to physical rehabilitation to education. High-end immersive surgery simulators provide a risk-free setting for physicians to practice life-saving procedures. VR has also proven itself to be an effective and engaging tool for training practitioners for patient interactions and procedures, an improvement over conventional training materials. For instance, researchers at the University of Southern California Institute for Creative Technologies have developed artificial intelligence agents that clinicians can use to practice skills required to conduct diagnostic assessments. Since the late-1990s, VR has also been successfully used to treat patients with depression and anxiety, as well as conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in burn victims and war fighters. Studies conducted by Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, Oxford and University College London, respectively, have also shown that VR treatments can be effective for the treatment of paranoia, drug addiction, as well as a variety of phobias. Due to the level of immersion it provides to users and the technology’s ability to block distractions from the physical environment, soothing VR experiences have also been beneficial for therapeutic treatments and pain management. In particular, they have been successful in easing the pain of burn victims or cancer patients undergoing treatment or rehabilitation. These palliative effects can be one of the greatest benefits of VR as survival rates can be increased through pain reduction. VR can also be a powerful tool for changing behaviors and building empathy; Planned Parenthood, for example, has created a VR film that relays the experience of a woman crossing a line of protestors in order to receive medical care. With VR technologies becoming mainstream, a shift toward safe, patient-centric and individualized healthcare is therefore promising in the near future. While VR can have a positive impact on the health of patients, concerns about its safety and potential danger to our health and social developments must be kept in mind as the technology develops. Beyond motion sickness and nausea caused by current technological limitations, long-term effects must be assessed, especially when the level of VR experiences become increasingly real. The ease of access with which pornography can be accessed means that sexual-themed VR content is already on its way. The immersiveness of VR sex could lead to severe addictions and potentially make real-world relationships less appealing for many people. Consequently, such technology could lead to a weakening of marital bonds and possibly a rise in divorce rates in the long term. Other addiction issues such as aggression, violence and isolation - similar to those observed in other technologies such as smartphones or video games which are not nearly as immersive as VR, need to be carefully investigated.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.133"
"4.362","Healthcare Data","","Medical researchers are increasingly make use of so-called DNA biobanks, or troves of genetic and medical record data that can be analysed relatively quickly thanks to increased computing power - in order to identify genes that are linked to specific health disorders. The Vanderbilt University Biobank in the US, for example, stores blood and tissue samples from roughly 2.8 million participants, and DNA samples from about 270,000 people; according to a blog post published by the Mayo Clinic in 2018, the effort could help identify ways to intervene sooner, and to offer earlier treatment for patients at risk of developing disorders. However, there are serious ethical questions to consider in relation to the widespread collection of data like genetic information: who should be authorized to gain access to someone’s personal genetic profile, for example, and how can genetic privacy be best protected. The private company 23andMe, for example, offers people the chance to both have their genetic information analysed, and to submit that data for the purposes of company research - raising concerns both about doing so without consulting with a trained medical professional, and about providing sensitive information like this to a private entity. The use of big data techniques, or the efficient sifting through massive, complex data sets in order to garner insights, is becoming increasingly prominent in the world of health care in ways that go beyond the use of genetic information. The growing use of wearable devices, for example, provides a means to directly connect things like glucose monitors to digital apps, which in turn can provide healthcare providers with ways to monitor an individual’s glucose profile over time. In addition, the combination of wearable devices and the Internet of Things, which can string multiple everyday devices together via an internet connection, creates a broad range of possibilities in terms of collecting and analysing data in order to study the health implications of daily habits, or monitor the elderly. However, there are important related legal and ethical issues. In The Fitbit Fault Line, an article published in the Yale Journal of Health Policy, Law, and Ethics in 2016, the author argued that because employers were beginning to collect and use employee health data mined from wearable devices in new and barely-regulated ways, it presented an opportunity to consider how best to legally protect these employees from the potential misuse of this data.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.71"
"4.363","Healthcare Delivery Systems","","People are living longer, and the quality of treatment for diseases like diabetes and cancer has improved, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. However, at least partly as a result of these improvements, healthcare spending has increased and now accounts for about 9% of GDP on average in OECD countries; meanwhile there is ample evidence of lingering inequality and inefficiency in terms of healthcare delivery, according to an OECD report published in 2017. According to the report, the percentage of the population covered by government and private health insurance for core services (such as doctor consultations and surgical procedures) is less than 95% in seven OECD countries, and is lowest in the US, Greece, and Poland. Greece, where 86% of the population was covered as of 2015, is still being affected by a lack of coverage for the long-term unemployed following the financial crisis, according to the report.   The cost of healthcare continues to be a serious impediment for many people around the world. The share of the population in OECD countries foregoing consultations due to cost is as high as 33% in Poland, according to the OECD report, 22.3% in the US, and 20.9% in Switzerland. The cost of prescribed medicines is also limiting access - 18% of the US population reported foregoing prescribed medicines, as did 11.6% in Switzerland, according to the report (the figure was as low as 2.3% in the United Kingdom, and 3.2% in Germany). In developing countries, the fact that health coverage tends to be paid for through taxes and salaries means it is inaccessible for the as much as 70% of the people in these places working in the unregulated, grey economy, according to an article published by the World Economic Forum in 2015. Coupled with a rise in chronic disease in these countries, there is a growing need to figure out ways to address related issues such as a lack of preventive care. Some solutions being developed involve bringing care directly to people - India’s Social Health Activist programme is designed to train 1 million community health workers, for example. Meanwhile digital solutions are also being devised; like many developing countries, Gabon is experiencing a surge in internet and mobile phone use - and it has sought to capitalize on that by boosting public access to health apps, according to a report published by the World Bank in 2016.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.61"
"4.364","Healthcare Human Capital","","In the US, about 2.3 million new health care workers will be needed by 2025 in order to adequately take care of the country’s ageing population, according to a report published in 2018 by staffing consultancy Mercer, while in the United Kingdom, the National Health Service is suffering from a severe shortage of nurses - with one part of England able to recruit just one nurse per every 400 vacancies, according to statistics published in 2018. While a lack of funding and poor pay have hurt the NHS’s ability to recruit, the result has negatively affected the quality of care and even threatened lives. Worldwide, an imbalance between available skills and market needs is having a tangible effect on healthcare system productivity and innovation. As political and business leaders assess a shifting disease burden landscape, the global shortage of health workers remains one of the biggest related challenges. In 2013, the World Health Organization projected that by 2035, the global shortage of health workers would increase from 7.2 million to 12.9 million. The constant migration of qualified health workers to countries that may have better working conditions or career opportunities has meanwhile left people in some regions with unequal access to health care, according to the WHO. The World Health Assembly adopted a Global Code of Practice in 2010, which aims to establish and promote ethical international recruitment of health personnel and to strengthen health systems; as of 2016, nearly one quarter of member states were considering changes to laws or policies to conform with code recommendations, and 70% reported that migrant health workers enjoyed the same legal rights and responsibilities as domestically-trained personnel. Ideas that have been proposed to help ease the burden on health care workers and health systems around the world include more flexible scheduling, efforts to specifically attract younger, more tech-savvy workers who might otherwise take jobs at firms like AirBnb or Google, and broader training and development programs that can expand a worker’s skills repertoire. Until adequate solutions for staffing issues emerge, the costs will be heavy in terms of both quality of care and financial well-being; in the US, the cost of so-called “travel nurses” who move from place to place to temporarily fill empty but essential positions doubled between 2014 and 2017, to $4.8 billion, according to Staffing Industry Analysts.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.71"
"4.365","Healthcare Technology","","Health technology innovation has given us basic tools like the electronic medical record, as well as futuristic developments like robotic surgery and precision medicine (which makes use of a patient's genetic profile and environment in order to diagnose and provide treatment). While biomedical research is offering up new medicines, devices, and mobile applications that can cure once-fatal diseases and more effectively manage chronic disease, many parts of the world still lack access to even the most basic healthcare. According to World Health Organization Global Health Observatory data, more than half of the deaths in the African Region during 2015 were the result of maternal, neonatal, and nutritional conditions. Expanding access to care and health technologies across the globe remains a challenge; the use of mobile technology presents intriguing related opportunities. The overall “mHealth” market was worth an estimated $23 billion by 2017, according to SNS Research, and is expected to grow significantly. In sub-Saharan Africa, which bears the highest disease burden in the world, and where mobile phone penetration rates have increased significantly in recent years, only 15% of the population has access to private health care, according to a report published by Deloitte in 2014, while more than 80% of private health care payments are made out of pocket. In response, mobile operators in sub-Saharan Africa have begun to better position themselves to facilitate health payments that are made via mobile devices, according to the Deloitte report; in Kenya, for example, the operator Safaricom has partnered with insurer Changamka Microhealth to enable health care payment via the M-PESA mobile money service. Meanwhile the deployment of so-called eHealth is also expanding. According to a report published by the World Health Organization in 2016, by 2015, 70% of European Union member states had national eHealth policies or strategies, and nearly all of them had financial support specifically for implementing these efforts. However, in 2018, the European Commission published a communication on the digital transformation of health and care, which cited slow and varied uptake of digital health solutions within the EU to date, and identified three areas for improvement: secure access to health data across borders; better access to advanced research; disease prevention and ""personalized"" health care (another term for precision medicine); and digital tools for citizen empowerment.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","['1.61', '1.71']"
"4.366","Heritage Protection and Cultural Sustainability","","The Catalogue of Endangered Languages features entries from 180 different countries and territories; Germany has 11, including Upper Sorbian and Western Yiddish, while the US has 165, ranging from Aleut to Zuni. Elements of intangible heritage, such as language, customs, ceremonies, rituals and traditions, are under threat due to the politics and forces of globalization - as societies and technologies change at a faster rate than ever before. Both these intangible and ""tangible"" (art works and monuments) heritage contain the diversity of human experience, and a framework for both individual and community identity. They nurture resilience in the face of change or crisis. It is therefore vital to protect and sustain what has been handed down to us from previous generations, in the face of multiple threats: climate change; armed conflict; neglect; unrestricted development; unregulated agricultural practices; and unsustainable tourism. While these dangers exist worldwide, they tend to worsen exponentially under crisis conditions. Not since World War II has the world’s cultural heritage faced such a threat of destruction as a result of conflict. Recent examples include the demolition of shrines in Timbuktu, Mali, in 2012 by an Islamic extremist linked to Al Qaeda (for which the extremist was found liable for $3.2 million in damages by an international court in 2018), the destruction of the Mosul Museum in Iraq by Islamic State militants who released recordings of the carnage in 2015, and the targeting of the ancient Roman site of Palmyra, Syria by the Islamic State, also in 2015. As the physical manifestation of our shared history, these archaeological sites, archives, libraries and museums are powerful symbols, making them targets for violence designed to tear apart the fabric of communities. Cultural heritage sites are also damaged by the black market in stolen artefacts and cultural objects. Large-scale evidence of looting at archaeological sites and museums by the Islamic State suggests that this plays an important role in the group’s financing. According to the Iraqi State Board of Antiquities and Heritage, the Islamic State both steals and sells artefacts itself, and sells permits to loot artefacts. Preserving and protecting cultural heritage must be included in conflict and crisis planning; in regions suffering from conflict, cultural heritage can play a crucial role by providing a basis for rebuilding. This key issue was curated in partnership with Huib Schippers, Director of Smithsonian Folkways Recordings at the Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage, and Katharyn Hanson, Fellow at the Smithsonian Museum Conservation Institute.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.13"
"4.367","Housing, Wealth and Affordability","","The global inflation of real estate prices has helped to shine a spotlight on broader issues related to housing affordability, wealth inequality, and inclusive economic growth. Due in part to the upward creep of home prices relative to income levels in many markets around the world, central banks and governments have sought to put measures in place to ease the financial pain for potential buyers. While policy-makers must attempt to prevent a resulting onset of housing bubbles, and ensure that people do not accumulate excessive debt, they must also recognize property as a store of value and means of wealth (a report published by the US Federal Reserve in 2018 noted that household wealth in the country had reached a record level in the last quarter of 2017, due in part to a roughly $500 billion increase in real estate value in the period). The general affordability of housing and the ability to accumulate wealth through property ownership depend, in part, on access to sources of financing and the availability of mortgage products - and on individual homeowners’ financial behaviour. Government intervention can be essential for helping to ensure housing affordability, for example by making efforts to raise levels of financial literacy, by helping to facilitate capital markets, by providing alternative funding sources and ways to mitigate risk, and by provisioning adequate amounts of public housing.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.112"
"4.368","Human Capital","","The travel and tourism industry directly and indirectly accounted for roughly 10% of the jobs in the world in 2016, and is expected to account for 11% by 2027, according a report published by the World Travel & Tourism Council in 2017. For every 30 new tourists traveling to a destination, it is estimated that one new job is created. In addition, the travel and tourism industry employs a relatively greater proportion of women than other sectors, and offers employment opportunities for many people entering the labour market for the first time, according to the World Tourism Organization and the International Labour Organization’s 2014 report Measuring Employment in the Tourism Industries.  Yet, the travel and tourism industry has difficulty attracting top talent for both technical and managerial positions. The World Travel & Tourism Council estimated in its 2015 Global Talent Trends and Issues report that talent gaps and deficiencies in the industry could cost the global economy nearly 14 million jobs and $610 billion in GDP between 2014 and 2024, focused primarily on China, France, Italy, the Russian Federation, and the US. In order to best address this challenge, the private sector needs to collaborate more closely with the public sector, work on updating relevant university and training programmes, and better keep up with market needs and technological advancements.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.16"
"4.369","Human Capital and Incentive Mechanisms","","Banking once held a privileged position when it comes to talent acquisition. But the global financial crisis severely tarnished the financial industry’s reputation, and also forced it to significantly alter its compensation models. Now, a potentially prolonged inability among banks to attract the best and brightest threatens to affect broader financial stability. Several trends are working against banks; not least, they are now competing for talent with a broader set of potential employers, including venture capital firms and technology startups. In order to address this issue, many banks have sought to develop ways to attract young hires who might otherwise opt for a tech startup. Canada’s Scotiabank, for example, has established a “Digital Factory” in Toronto that provides a number of technology-related jobs; as of late 2018 it was advertising positions including UX researchers, software developers, and social media managers. Swiss bank UBS has meanwhile established “innovation labs” and “innovation outposts” in various cities including Zurich and San Francisco, as places to explore things like blockchain, smart contracts, and wealth management-related innovation. While the best talent available may no longer seek out mainstream finance work, the growing complexity of financial products requires a more careful matching between the skills of potential employees and job requirements. This issue has resulted in disaster in the securitization market, for example, due to a lack of understanding of complex derivative securities among both investors and originators. The general decline in attractiveness of financial firms as potential employers has also led to fewer students choosing finance as a major in college, which limits the quality of talent available to the industry. Once-popular MBA programs and other traditional courses related to finance are being crowded out by newer options; at the University of California, Berkeley, for example, the fastest-growing class is now introduction to data science, and the school announced plans in 2018 to create a new Division of Data Science and Innovation. As technology increasingly gains influence within the finance industry, substantial investment on the part of banks in related education for employees is needed.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.18"
"4.370","Human Capital and Mindsets","","Entrepreneurial skills such as effectively pitching ideas, providing inspirational leadership that can attract talent, and having the operational wherewithal to expand a business need to become more widespread. That means that experiential learning tools, like internships and business plan competitions, are critical. Just as important: the need to nurture entrepreneurial mindsets. Young people need to become adept at seeing opportunities where others see problems, taking risks, accepting failure and questioning authority. A lack of the right mindset can lead to a reinforcement of the status quo. In addition to education systems, corporate cultures also need to embrace the cultivation of entrepreneurial mindsets.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.47"
"4.371","Human Capital and Work Reform","","The Japanese government has predicted that the country’s working-age population (people aged between 15 and 64) will drop to 44 million by 2060, from 81 million as of 2010. In response, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe created a new ministerial post in 2015 that was charged with boosting the country’s declining birth rate, from 1.46 children per woman to 1.8, in order to help bolster the economy. With only 2% of its population currently comprised of foreigners, Japan is also starting to dabble in immigration policies that could expand and diversify its workforce. Japan’s work culture is also problematic; the concept of “karoshi,” or death from overwork, has unfortunately become widely familiar. The country’s first study of this phenomenon, released in October 2016, found that nearly 12% of Japanese firms reported that workers had completed more than 100 hours of overtime per month, and one quarter of the firms reported that workers had completed more than 80 hours a month.  The Japanese government has focused on diversifying the labour force, and breaking the model of lifelong service to a single employer - which is still nonetheless prevalent in the country. As the site of significant advancements in robotics, automation, and artificial intelligence, Japan is well-positioned to leverage these technologies, and potentially without unnecessarily causing significant rates of unemployment as a result. In addition, enriching the labour market by diversifying potential career paths, better facilitating the adoption of new skills, and revising relatively restrictive immigration policies could all help to better sustain Japan’s economy. In 2018, the country enacted a law that allows more foreign, blue-collar workers to entry the country, albeit for limited periods and without family members.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.88"
"4.372","Human Development","","Gross domestic product per capita may be a good way of indicating a nation’s well-being, but material conditions are certainly not everything. As acknowledged by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the measure of well-being should include quality-of-life aspects, like one’s sense of personal security, social connections, happiness, skills and education. The behavioural sciences can help us study how to best pursue these outcomes. Small inputs and changes in narrative can be effective in determining how people react to adversity, and whether they see it as a challenge they can overcome. For example, behavioural scientists have shed light on the conditions under which students at schools and universities can better flourish. The Behavioural Insights Team, a publicly owned, UK-based company, found that fewer students with disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds apply to university than students from higher income families, even when these students have the same grades and abilities; however, if such students from lower income families received letters of encouragement from enrolled students with the same socioeconomic background, their application rates increased by 3%. A study by Stanford University researchers published in Science in 2011 demonstrated that simply teaching students that all newcomers to college worry about fitting in, but that over time, everyone feels more at home, both halved the racial-achievement gap and improved the health of African American students. Behaviourally-informed interventions have also effectively improved outcomes for children in the developing world. One example: early childhood development interventions that increase psychosocial stimulation in children from very poor families. One report about an early childhood intervention that took place in 1986 and 1987 in low-income neighborhoods in Kingston, Jamaica, showed that twenty years later, stunted children who had received psychosocial stimulation earned, on average, 25% more than stunted children who did not receive stimulation, and had eventually caught up with other children who had not been classified as stunted before the intervention. Other research has examined the boundaries that prevent children from regularly attending school in remote or conflict-affected areas of the world. One factor shown to have a strong impact on attendance is a student’s travel time to school. For example, the installment of village-based schools in remote areas of Afghanistan has been shown to increase school enrollment rates from 27% to 68%. The effect was also stronger for girls, reducing the gender gap in school enrollment. Human development faces myriad other challenges. For example, how can ageing societies in Europe, the US and Japan maintain inclusiveness for the elderly? Identifying and removing barriers that keep older adults from staying actively engaged is crucial, in this regard. For example, residential areas need to be built to enable older adults to stay social and mobile, despite their limited movement - by adding more easily accessible public spaces with ample seating, or providing hand rails.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.20"
"4.373","Human Dignity","","Being human is not something you earn. Yet, despite its shared, intrinsic quality, basic humanity is regularly denied to disabled people and other marginalized groups. The preservation of human rights for most people relies upon a mix of engineered access, laws, customs, and technology (unlike civil rights, human rights belong to the individual). Dignity, meanwhile, while fundamental to human rights (the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights cites the recognition of dignity as the foundation of freedom, justice, and peace), is nonetheless perennially vulnerable. Safeguarding human dignity has not always been valued, and care must be taken to ensure it is respected. In terms of design, this means re-thinking entire systems, structures, and technologies. One simple, often-overlooked example of rethinking traditional design in order to expand access and usability is the tactile, bumpy surface now applied to stretches of sidewalk around the world in order to warn vision-impaired pedestrians about obstacles like curbs. These “tenji blocks” are courtesy of Japanese inventor Seiichi Miyake, who developed them in the 1960s. Inclusive design requires working closely with communities to tailor a project’s goals to local needs - and giving priority to the vulnerable. Functional support ensures participation, and is a cornerstone of human dignity. Effective functional support encompasses more than physical inclusion, however. For example, language itself needs to be inclusive, and to avoid stigmatizing. And while governments do not confer human dignity, their actions or inaction can either support or erode it. Disability is a useful means to help these governments understand inclusion; The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, adopted in 2006, is the first comprehensive human rights treaty of the 21st century. It is a benchmark framework that guides international progress in formulating and enforcing legislation, strategies, policies and programs that promote equality, inclusion and the empowerment of persons with disabilities. The Convention, which had an initial 82 signatories, the highest number ever for a UN convention on its opening day (the number of signatories has now topped 160), can help ensure human rights and fundamental freedom for many people in need. This key issue was curated in partnership with Katherine Ott, Curator in the Department of Medicine and Science at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History and Beth Ziebarth, Director of the Accessibility Program for the Smithsonian Institution.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.76"
"4.374","Human Mobility and Exploitation","","There are more than 240 million international migrants in the world, equivalent to about 3.3% of the global population, and the total number of displaced people is the highest on record, according to the International Organization for Migration’s World Migration Report 2018. This spike has been driven by efforts to find refuge or seek out economic opportunities. However, concerns about integrating migrants and security have ensured that legitimate opportunities for the displaced fail to match demand. As a result, a massive number of people are being exploited by an unscrupulous and exploitative system that profits from human trafficking and illicit labour. According to a report published by Europol, in 2015 alone smugglers transporting people to and from Europe created an industry that was worth more than €6 billion and employed more than 40,000 workers. While smugglers have become an important lifeline for people caught up in conflict or chronic poverty, they have also become a potent source of violence, insecurity, and brutal exploitation. Human trafficking is a universal problem; it occurs everywhere and can take many forms. On any given day in 2016, 40 million people were victims to modern slavery, including 25 million people in forced labour and 15 million people in forced marriages, according to a report published in 2017 by the International Labour Organization (ILO). Women and girls account for 71% of modern slavery victims, according to the report. This impacts both public well-being and private sector operations; the ILO report noted that the manufacturing sector, which accounted for 15% of forced labour exploitation cases, includes a medical gloves industry that is worth more than $5 billion annually and largely relies on migrant workers at outsourced factories in Asia. Documented concerns at many of these factories included excessive working hours and the illegal retention of passports, according to the report. While related legal provisions and protections exist, they are insufficient. A report published in 2014 by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimated that more than 2 billion people were still not benefitting from protections included in the United Nations Trafficking in Persons Protocol - which had entered into force in 2003. Public-private partnerships are essential for addressing human rights abuses, and the private sector can play a particularly important role by fostering healthy debate about the global mobility of labour.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.75"
"4.375","Human Well-Being and Oceans","","The oceans are more than a beautiful home to inspiring ocean wildlife; they are a critically important source of nutritious food, income, jobs, and global stability. The oceans yield $2.5 trillion annually in goods and services, according to a “conservative” estimate published in 2017 by the consultancy BCG, making them equivalent to one of the largest single economies in the world. The oceans provide millions of jobs in fishing, aquaculture, tourism, energy, transportation, and biotechnology. The value of ocean resources is particularly important for poor countries. Fishery net exports from developing countries alone have been valued at $37 billion, or more than value of meat, tobacco, rice, and sugar exports combined, according to a report published in 2018 by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Wealthier nations are also dependent on ocean resources. The collapse of cod stocks along the east coast of Canada, for example, sparked the largest mass layoffs in the country’s history and prompted large-scale migration from affected provinces. Canada spent almost $2 billion between 1994 and 1998 on aid and recovery programs aimed at coping with this social and ecological disaster. The oceans act as a massive refrigerator of free-range, highly nutritious food fit for human consumption. According to the FAO, fish provide more than 3.1 billion people with at least 20% of their animal protein, and serve as a critically important source of nutrients essential to good health like iron, zinc, and omega-3 fatty acids. Researchers estimate that if current trajectories for fishery decline persist, 845 million people could become at risk of diseases associated with malnutrition. Ocean health and human health intersect in other important, but sometimes less obvious ways. Fishery declines have been linked to human trafficking when, for example, child and slave labour is used to capture increasingly rare fish. Another example: some analysts suggest that piracy in Somalia and West Africa can partially be explained by disenfranchised fishermen turning to violence in order to protect decreasing offshore fish stocks. In situations where overfishing has depleted potentially lucrative species, organized crime has also escalated. In Mexico’s Sea of Cortez, for example, it is believed that drug cartels may be involved in an illicit industry that is both depleting a critically-endangered fish and threatening to trigger the extinction of the Vaquita (a small porpoise).","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.103"
"4.376","Human and Environmental Health","","About 2.1 billion people, or roughly three in 10 people worldwide, do not have access to safe drinking water from a home faucet, according to a World Health Organization report published in 2017 - and more than 4.5 billion people lack sanitary toilet facilities. The global surplus of dirty water sickens and kills millions of people annually, as a result of diarrhoea and waterborne diseases; according to the WHO report, roughly 361,000 children under the age of five die every year due to diarrhoea, while poor sanitation and contaminated water are linked to diseases such as cholera and dysentery. Because substances readily dissolve into water (which has been dubbed the universal solvent), it is often where pollutants end up. Aquifers (layers of permeable rock that serve as reservoirs for ground water), rivers, and tap water can all become potentially dangerous conduits for the chemical and bacterial markers of their surroundings: lead from pipes; industrial solvents from manufacturing facilities; mercury from unlicensed gold mines; viruses from animal waste; and nitrates and pesticides from farm fields. The world’s ecosystems are also at risk from the degradation and extraction of water. In estuaries, rivers, and lakes, harmful algal blooms, fuelled by increased amounts of fertilizers, are a growing global menace. Mats of toxic algae in a rainbow swirl of greens, reds, and browns are killing fish, turning away tourists, contaminating drinking water, and depressing property values. Water withdrawals and unsustainable development have also taken a toll; large lakes such as Lake Chad, with its basin shared by five countries in Africa’s Sahel region, and Lake Urmia, in Iran, are drying up. Lake Chad, for example, has lost most of its water during the past half century, according to a report published by NASA Earth Observatory in 2017, and spans less than one-tenth of the area it covered as of the 1960s. Fresh water provided by Lake Chad is the lifeblood of more than 30 million people, according to the report. Important marsh ecosystems are also declining - as much as half of the world’s wetlands have been filled in, and the rate of wetland loss has accelerated in recent decades. In addition, dams have been constructed that slice rivers into segments, a habitat fragmentation that has decimated salmon in the Pacific Northwest in the US and fisheries in the Mekong River Basin in Asia.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.134"
"4.377","Humanness and Autonomy","","Amid all of the advances being made in the fields of artificial intelligence, robotics, and virtual and augmented reality, it will be crucial for us to maintain a focus on what makes us truly human. While related philosophical principles have been around at least since the time of ancient Greece, we may need to come up with new, practical ways to ensure that human enhancement actually preserves our humanity (assuming that we do find the idea of becoming post-human appealing). Related questions to ponder include how enhancements can keep human needs and desires in focus, how technology can integrate social interaction rather than substitute for social interaction, and how greater autonomy be attained without also increasing isolation and undermining shared values. We tend to evaluate the risk and reward of enhancements based on their potential to improve our well-being, and we technically have the freedom to decide whether or not to undergo an enhancing procedure - yet, we need to be mindful of related peer pressure, which can compromise our autonomy. Technologies that affect social interaction are in high demand, and evolving, as conflict resolution and negotiation remain essential elements of the business and political worlds. Important social skills or moderated behaviour, for example, may be imparted via brain implants; in a handful of cases, doctors have administered implants as part of a treatment called deep brain stimulation in order to tame behaviours associated with autism, according to a report published in the journal Science in 2018. Despite the promise of such innovation, our fundamental autonomy is at stake, as humankind continues to experiment with technologies that have the potential to alter - for better or worse - emotional regulation and social interaction. In the interest of preserving autonomy, it is crucial that we guarantee the transparency of and access to information related to enhancing interventions, so as to help people make critical choices and evaluate potential impact. Some enhancements, for example, might promote success early in life - but then lead to serious disability later on. Unbiased research institutions are necessary in this regard, in order to play a role in testing related products and helping consumers.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.72"
"4.378","Hyperconnectivity and Bank Regulation","","Interaction among banks, the capital markets where governments and businesses raise essential funds, and investors has been profoundly changed by the mix of greater internet access, mobile devices, and social networks. New developments in terms of the collection and use of customer data have enabled banks to offer customized products and services. While these may generate increased activity, they are also increasingly being offered by new players that are not necessarily banks - transforming the financial services playing field. Customers have benefited from greater autonomy when it comes to arranging investment portfolios, developing trading strategies and making payments. In addition, new potential customers have emerged, who may not have previously had access to financial services. According to a report published by the International Finance Corporation in 2017, Ant Financial, the Chinese FinTech firm, had 450 million clients at that time - or ten times the number served by any one of the world’s largest banks. The emergence of players like this has far-reaching implications for traditional intermediaries. It also has implications for regulation and financial stability. General financial literacy will have to improve substantially, in order for the global financial system to take full, sustainable advantage of this development. The further democratization of finance through technology advancement calls for a more inter-disciplinary approach, that involves big data analysis, takes full advantage of computing expertise, and emphasizes investment in cybersecurity. It also demands that regulators carefully weigh the relative importance of access to products, financial stability, and consumer protection. In response to calls for greater stability, there has been an increased focus in recent years on bank-level, or “microprudential” regulation. The Bank for International Settlements, which oversees global financial cooperation, has reported that post-crisis reforms have been designed to strengthen microprudential regulation, and thereby increase the resilience of individual banks during periods of stress. However, the concern now for economies is not necessarily the failure of an individual bank, but rather a system-wide collapse potentially triggered by non-traditional financial services firms, according to a report published by the World Bank in 2013. While regulatory limits on banks have encouraged the growth of unregulated “shadow banks,” according to the report, potential runs on the shadow banking system (when spooked customers withdraw funds at an unsustainable rate) are a prominent source of systemic financial risk.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.18"
"4.379","Identity Fraud and Cyber Resilience","","The growing use of digital identities online - in combination with the massive volume of personal data increasingly being collected by governments, businesses, and everything from wearable devices to household appliances - creates vulnerabilities. According to the Breach Level Index, an online database, more than 15 billion data records have been lost or stolen since 2013, and the 3.4 billion compromised records in the first half of 2018 alone represented a 72% increase compared with the same period a year earlier. High-profile breaches in recent years include the compromised data of nearly 150 million people at credit-reporting firm Equifax, for which the company agreed to a $700 million settlement, and the 30 million identity numbers (and associated financial information) leaked online in South Africa in 2017. Meanwhile new threats continue to emerge: according to the US Federal Reserve, the fastest-growing financial crime, “synthetic identity fraud,” involves using fake information to establish a bogus credit file and then make transactions. Several approaches have emerged to better secure identities and build resilience, including minimal data collection and disclosure, and informed consent. Bolstering digital literacy and helping people better understand the need for password-free, multi-factor authentication can also help. Security is often directly embedded in the design of digital identity systems. For example, the Belgian government’s app “itsme” uses multifactor authentication criteria including biometrics, a mobile phone number, and a SIM card linked to the user - along with a personal itsme code. In the wake of the Equifax breach, the company teamed with financial technology firm FIS to create OnlyID, a digital identity tool that uses biometrics to reduce fraud, improve customer experiences, and rebuild trust and brand loyalty. When it comes to the Internet of Things, which ties everyday consumer devices together via an online connection, the European Technical Standards Institute has endorsed a set of security-by-design principles - like ensuring devices are not pre-set with passwords, providing a point of contact for reporting and responding to issues, and opting into timely software updates. Achieving completely infallible security is impossible - and security is more of a process than a state of being. Stakeholders in all sectors and industries should take proactive design and policy steps to protect digital identities and personal data, provide mechanisms to address data breaches and regain user trust, and encourage digital stills training.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.41"
"4.380","Identity and Persona Management","","Identity and the management of identity are critical foundations for our everyday interaction with the world as taxpayers, consumers and employees. Increasingly digitalized societies and economies mean that the manner in which identity is managed is essential for realizing related benefits. For industries ranging from banking to healthcare, blockchain can be used to respond to the need for digital identity and persona management by providing a system more in tune with changing needs. As the use of internet services grows, for example, people may have an increasing desire to be able to actively manage their digital identities independent of the control of a public entity or private company, like a bank or a social network. So-called self-sovereign identity systems provide a way to do that, by enabling single online identities to form independent, online relationships with each other and with other services. In a report updated in 2017, the non-profit Sovrin Foundation suggested that such systems, underpinned by blockchain, could turn organizations that are now identity providers into “identity proofers,” as users securely take their own identity from place to place.       Identity management is also critical for enabling the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals established in 2015. Goal 16 specifically calls for the provision of a legal identity for everyone in the world by 2030 - in order to ensure access to basic services and rights. According to the UN, as of 2017 the regional average for populations that had been assigned a birth registration was just 71%, while less than half of children under five years of age in sub-Saharan Africa had had their births registered. Effective identity management systems, utilizing a shared blockchain infrastructure, could ultimately help bolster social protection, assist in dealing with disasters, create more resilient economies, reduce corruption, and empower women. ConsenSys, a company that has been recognized by the UN for its efforts, has developed a blockchain-based identification system designed to help end child trafficking in Moldova, for example. In any country, resilient digital identity systems can potentially help citizens to better understand all the data being stored about them, and to know when others have accessed that data. Key challenges, however, include both the scalability of the blockchain, and the need to maintain individual privacy while using the technology.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.24"
"4.381","Illicit Financial Flows","","Illicit Financial Flows (IFFs) have come into particular focus following the release of the Panama Papers (a trove of documents detailing the questionable establishment of offshore wealth vehicles) in 2016, and the Paradise Papers (a related effort detailing offshore investments) in 2017. IFFs are defined as capital that crosses borders in hidden form. Money may be sent abroad because the way it is earned violates social norms in a particular country, because it may be vulnerable to seizure or taxation, or because it is illegally gained - as is the case with embezzlement, bribes, and money earned through smuggling drugs or people. The amounts involved are enormous; total IFFs are estimated to exceed $1 trillion annually. (Meanwhile total global development assistance amounts to only $100 billion per year.) A background paper for the World Development Report published in 2017 emphasized the importance of recognizing diverse forms of IFFs. Different types have disparate consequences for countries where the inflow and outflow of money occur, and may require different policy solutions. For example, money sent abroad by corrupt senior officials may be best addressed with the adoption of beneficial ownership registration, while the automatic exchange of information between tax authorities in different countries may be most effective for countering transfer pricing abuse - which enables multinationals to shift revenue to jurisdictions with lower taxes. The non-profit group Global Financial Integrity regularly publishes reports on IFFs. Its investigations have found that illicit inflows arriving in Russia through trade between 1994 and 2011 were a particular problem. Export over-invoicing, which enables the fraudulent earning of export subsidies, amounted to $145.8 billion during that period, according to the investigations, while import under-invoicing, which fraudulently avoids customs duties, totalled $397.1 billion. A Deutsche Bank study showed that illicit outflows from Russia correlated with London property prices between 2007 and 2011. In China, so-called trade misinvoicing is a significant problem, and is especially prevalent in the mobile phone market. Multilateral efforts are underway to stem the flow of IFFs, though their effectiveness is frequently questioned. Tackling IFFs is regularly the subject of G7 and G20 statements, and is incorporated in the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. Often, impediments to change in this area are political in nature, as it would require those in power to enforce - and in some cases, to adopt - laws that run counter to the interests of elites in their respective countries.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.37"
"4.382","Illicit Trade and Financial Flows","","Illicit trade can involve legal goods that have nonetheless violated regulations during transit - based on how they were sourced or produced, or through theft, diversion, or misrepresentation. The financial flows generated by illicit trade appear to be growing. A working paper published by the International Monetary Fund in 2018 presented data on 158 countries showing that the average size of their shadow economy relative to GDP between 1991 and 2015 was 31.9% (the largest was Bolivia, at 62.3%, and the smallest was Switzerland, at 7.2%). The revenues generated by transnational crime are estimated to be worth as much as $2.2 trillion annually, according to a report published in 2017 by the think tank Global Financial Integrity. According to the report, counterfeiting brings in as much as $1.1 trillion annually, drug trafficking earns as much as $652 billion, and organ trafficking earns as much as $1.7 billion. Frontier Economics, a research firm, has estimated that the value of digitally-pirated films may reach $622 billion in 2022, up from $160 billion in 2013, while the value of digitally-pirated music may grow to $117 billion from $29 billion over the same period. The negative effects of illicit trade are far-reaching and dramatic. An estimated one in 10 medical products circulating in low- and middle-income countries is either sub-standard or falsified, according to a report published in 2017 by the World Health Organization. As many as 169,000 children may be dying every year from pneumonia due to sub-standard and falsified antibiotics, according to the report, while in sub-Saharan Africa, sub-standard and falsified antimalarials are responsible for as many as 158,000 deaths and $38.5 million in unnecessary health care costs annually. Companies, governments, and non-governmental organizations are all demonstrating an increased awareness of this problem and are cooperating to address it - though successful partnership models have yet to emerge. Through the World Trade Organization's Bali Package, passed in 2013, governments have affirmed their commitments to a secure trade facilitation agenda, and both the G20 and the B20 (a summit of business leaders from G20 countries) have highlighted a need to address illicit trade issues.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.75"
"4.383","Immersive Journalism and Environmental Stewardship","","Virtual reality (VR) can be a powerful technology for captivating an audience by placing them in the midst of real-life events instead of observing them from the outside. This level of immersion can create deep empathy and emotions for viewers, and is particularly suited for events that take place in a defined space. Nonny de la Pena, a former senior research fellow in immersive journalism at the University of Southern California (USC), developed a comprehensive VR system, with the Mixed Reality Lab at USC. Motion-tracked headsets are employed to place the user into a game engine-driven virtual environment to convey news, documentaries and non-fiction stories. Her work “Hunger in Los Angeles”, shown at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival, is a virtual simulation of a man falling into a diabetic coma while waiting for food in a food bank line at the First Unitarian Church in Los Angeles. The participant plays an eyewitness and enters the story as a digital avatar in the first-person perspective. Some level of interaction is enabled though scripted events between the user and other virtual characters, which increases the sense of presence and connectivity. While higher end commercial VR headsets, such as the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive, are preferred for profound experiences, smartphone-based solutions, such as the Google Daydream or Samsung Gear VR, can reach a significantly larger segment of the world, one of the key goals of journalism. Through hands-on hackathon-like experimentations and collaborations, the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism is one of the dominant players exploring mobile VR platforms as a medium for digital story telling. In collaboration with ProPublica and the Texas Tribune, a team at USC traveled to Houston in 2016 to shoot an immersive experience that investigates the city’s vulnerability to hurricanes. Viewers can experience storm scenarios and natural catastrophe visualizations of the city, all in 360 degrees. Hurricane Harvey, a major hurricane, happened a year later, causing a catastrophic flooding in southeastern Texas. If VR is here to stay, VR journalism will be inevitable for and disruptive to the industry. VR allows people to be transported to foreign environments and events with minimal effort or cost. Scientists are positing that it has the potential to become a potent tool for environmental conservation. The results of a study published in the September 2016 issue of the Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication suggested that immersive virtual environments may help people to empathize with animals and endangered environments. The XL Catlin Seaview Survey, whose initial aim was to capture visual evidence of the state of the world’s coral reefs and to make this available to researchers, may also carry the powerful side effect of awareness-raising. That is explicitly what the team at the Stanford Virtual Human Interaction Lab have set out to accomplish with their Ocean Acidification Experience, a free virtual reality simulation, released in October 2016. Through teaching about the causes of ocean acidification, it also seeks to empower the viewer to help combat this scourge. Through his VR installation, Daniel Steegman Mangrane virtually teleports viewers to a Brazilian rain forest captured via 3D laser scanning, allowing the audience to move around one of the fastest disappearing environments of the world. Virtual reality can also serve conservation-related research purposes. In early 2016, researchers from the Queensland University of Technology and the Lupunaluz Foundation captured 360-degree footage to document threats to jaguar habitats in the Amazon. The goal of this exercise was to capture visual data of conservation efforts: by filming the area, researchers can study friendly habitats and jaguar behavior patterns from afar.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.133"
"4.384","Immersive Media and Art","","In 2016, journalist Jesse Damiani argued on Upload that current immersive media are dominated by two genres: true virtual reality (VR) and 360-degree cinema. True VR gives users the full freedom to explore 3D virtual environments, while 360-videos are limited by a stationary viewing experience, similar to conventional panoramic gallery views. True VR provides the necessary interactivity and depth of immersion, but the experience often feels like a computer game. Though highly compelling and realistic virtual environments are possible nowadays with state-of-the-art game engines like Unity or Unreal, the content creation process is highly complex and expensive. Photoreal live-action recordings can be easily achieved for 360-degree footages using spherical camera systems such as Google Jump or Ricoh Theta, but arbitrary viewing angles are not possible. As true VR becomes increasingly realistic and 360-degree capture techniques become more sophisticated, predicting unseen regions, both types of media will likely converge as time passes. For now, however, filmmakers, game developers and artists will have to pick one or the other. Film techniques in VR are still in their infancy. Jessica Brillhart, the principal filmmaker for VR at Google, relayed that VR is all about putting the user in the middle of the action so that they become active participants rather than passive watchers following a director’s storyline. Her 360 VR videos focus on an embodied experience: a non-linear and non-narrative story-telling, in which creators are sharing their vantage point with the audience, seeming to teleport viewers into a different space and time. A more participatory and immersive experience has been demonstrated by director Ramiro Lobez Dau (Oculus Story Studio) in his animated short film Henry, released in 2015. Users – no longer just viewers - can connect with the main character when it looks directly into the viewers’ eyes during moments of extreme emotion. While this Pixar-like VR production earned an Emmy award in 2016 in an interactive media category, VR still has yet to achieve mainstream success. VR and AR technologies are also pushing the frontiers of art forward, letting users fully escape into a different world through affordable immersive headsets. Australian artist Lynette Wallworth has experimented with VR to tell the story of an indigenous elder in her native country. Her 2016 work, Collisions, which was executive produced by the Forum in collaboration with the Sundance Institute (and which premiered at the Forum’s Annual Meeting in Davos-Klosters in 2016), is powerful because it immerses the viewer in the film and allows them to experience rituals in a way not previously possible with traditional cinematography. Collisions was shown to the Australian Parliament in autumn 2016, before their budget debate, and the parliament then voted to include, for the first time in 50 years of advocacy, reparations for indigenous people who experienced the British nuclear tests in the 1950s, which is the very subject of the documentary. A different example comes from a collaborative effort based at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, titled The Enemy. This project brings virtual renditions of combatants in war zones to the users’ viewing space, allowing them to discover the humanity shared between combatants, seemingly right in front of them. Nevertheless, it would be wrong to describe frontier-breaking as the only application of VR in the arts. The technology also allows for existing artistic works to be revisited in different ways. In 2016, a British digital agency created a VR app called Bosch VR, which allows app users to travel through Dutch painter Hieronymus Bosch’s “Garden of Earthly Delights” (1503-1515). The art comes alive, and users are able to move around in the artwork. The app WoofbertVR allows users to virtually visit the collection of many museums worldwide, including the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, serving an educational purpose. Similar walk-through experiences have been launched by Google through partnerships with several museums, including the Dulwich Picture Gallery in London, BOZAR in Brussels, the Museu de Arte Moderna in Rio De Janeiro, and the Robben Island Museum in Cape Town. The technology also allows users to explore archaeological sites, such as the Forbidden City Virtual Reality tour offered by the Palace Museum in Beijing since 2015. While current smartphone-based VR solutions are still limited by low resolutions and stationary positions, the technology is expected to improve rapidly in the coming years and the content will become more interactive.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.133"
"4.385","Impact Investing","","Finance is an essential force for systemic change, and must find its way to projects and innovation that can actually improve lives. The United Nations estimates that $2.5 trillion in funding is needed to achieve the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals - the 17 goals established in 2015 to guide global development until 2030. They encompass a broad range of targets, including reducing the portion of the population living in poverty by at least half, ending hunger and all forms of malnutrition, and achieving the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources. Recent financial innovation has helped to better harness investment to fund social innovation, and a deeper pool of capital is available than what had been established previously through philanthropy alone in order to support organizations aiming to have a social impact. For example, “blended finance” is an increasingly popular way to fund impact investing by tailoring risk for individual investors within a group - including those from the private sector. Impact investing is distinct from the growing trend of “ESG” investing, which involves funding publicly traded companies already demonstrating good environmental, social and governance practices. Impact investing focuses on creating measurable, positive impact, and several related, significant funds have been formed such as Vital Capital Fund, which is primarily focused on sub-Saharan Africa. A set of tools and resources has evolved to help impact investors measure the social and environmental benefits of their investments, such as the IRIS metrics developed by the Global Impact Investing Network, and GIIRS Ratings. However, a single, standard set of metrics has yet to be adopted by the impact investment industry as a whole. That means that investors use a combination of approaches to measure the impact of their investments, including qualitative and anecdotal evidence in addition to standardized tools. The greatest challenge to the growth of impact investing is a lingering lack of high-quality investment opportunities with measurable impact. In addition, social entrepreneurs, especially in the so-called “valley of death period” prior to realizing the initial revenue generated by a venture, often require additional training and support in order to gain a deeper understanding of their investment needs.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.118"
"4.386","Impact of Regulation","","Investment firms are grappling with obligations imposed by new financial regulations enacted as a result of the 2008 global financial crisis. Many firms have been contending with the need to strengthen their governance structures and invest in legal, compliance, information technology and marketing functions due to new regulation, for example the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act passed in 2010 and Basel III, agreed in 2010-2011. Many of these regulations were a direct result of the 2008 crisis. Governments were under immense pressure to demand accountability from the industry that was blamed for causing the crisis. According to a 2008 Gallup Poll, 60% of Americans surveyed believed that passing new, stricter regulations on financial institutions was critical, and only 21% were of the opinion that large financial institutions deserved any assistance. Alternative investment firms of all sizes have incurred significant costs to comply with the new regulatory environment. This has put pressure on the industry and has caused some consolidation and increased barriers to entry. Some private investors also claim that these costs have the effect of reducing the flow of capital to illiquid and long-term investments affecting infrastructure projects as well as funding for small businesses. There is also the sentiment that more money allocated to operations will reduce the rate of return for long-term retirement-oriented portfolios. Regulation is likely to continue to be a major conversation point for the industry as, as late as 2013 nearly 50% of Americans polled in a Pew Research Center survey thought that regulation of financial institutions was not robust enough, part of the continued worldwide anger towards the financial sector for the 2008 crisis. The industry will not only need to be able to understand the technical aspects of forthcoming regulation, but also the drivers behind them.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.110"
"4.387","Impact of Technological Innovations","","New technology offers a range of opportunities to protect and secure human rights. For instance, satellite and other imagery sources are increasingly being used to monitor and uncover gross human rights violations. Such images can later be used as evidence in bringing perpetrators to justice. On an individual level, documentation and sharing can quickly bring widespread attention to particular issues and abuses. And technology enables the organization and mobilization of citizens and activists seeking to secure their rights. Like all technologies, there are risks. There are the dangers posed to rights by the use of new technologies themselves. The problems of surveillance and monitoring, which are not new, are exacerbated by technological innovation. Data collection and sharing is made significantly easier, and data from disparate sources can be collated to build a comprehensive and intrusive profile of individuals. Transformation of business and work can undermine labour protections. And advances in weaponry threaten to upset existing regulation and incentive structures in armed conflict. On the regulatory side, sectoral and subject-specific solutions are required, and demand different levels of regulation. Concerning autonomous weapons, for instance, there is currently a rich debate as to how they fit with existing principles of international law, as well as how states ought to regulate them domestically. In respect of online technology, there is a complicated mixture of international, national and self-regulation; privacy protections are developing, though perhaps without keeping up with technological change. Concerning the transformation of work, proactive measures are required to ensure the applicability of rights protections in new contexts.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.73"
"4.388","Impact on Social Movements","","Through the interpretation of their texts and traditions, religious actors have extensive resources to help promote social activism on issues ranging from environmental stewardship to social justice. Many religious groups and organizations are actively combating climate change and fighting against racial and social inequality, though religion’s direct role in these efforts varies. Religious-based action on climate change is increasing. Related approaches include eco-justice, stewardship, and ecological spirituality. These can contribute to the protection of the most vulnerable populations, to the fulfilment of a shared responsibility for the common good, and to ethical solutions to environmental challenges that uphold principles of social and economic justice. In 2017, Pope Francis and Orthodox Christian leader Patriarch Bartholomew called for world leaders to collectively respond to climate change, while noting that the most vulnerable people will be the first to suffer from related effects, for example. Climate change threatens to derail development progress for many countries. This has amplified related concerns about food security, agricultural productivity, the spread of disease, population displacement, water scarcity, and energy security. In addition to coordinated advocacy efforts for environmental protection, religious actors are engaged in environmental education, disaster relief, and smaller-scale projects related to water management and agricultural reform. Religious groups have also led cutting-edge initiatives to combat racial, economic, and educational disparities around the globe. For example, an extensive international network of Jesuit schools reaches countless disadvantaged children through innovative educational offerings. Numerous other Christian, Islamic, Jewish, Buddhist, Hindu, and other religiously affiliated aid organizations are similarly engaged in education, gender, racial justice, and health initiatives. However, religion factors into social movements in complex ways. In the US, for example, African-American churches once served as the heart of the civil rights movement, while today they are far less prominent in the Black Lives Matter movement. More troubling are some grassroots political movements, particularly in western countries, that promote the idea of the white, Christian, and heterosexual male as the true national identity. Such social-political movements often undermine unified domestic or global action on shared threats, such as climate change or forced migration, not to mention efforts to promote social and racial justice, and gender parity.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.115"
"4.389","Improved Lives","","As life expectancy increases, there has been a greater focus on improving the quality of life - rather than simply extending life. Some of the greatest related developments of our time have been made possible thanks to the use of advanced materials. This fertile field enables some of the most exciting elements of modern life, while also enhancing safety. The oscillators in antennas make wireless communication reliable, for example, and we entrust our lives to the sensor arrays that make up medical equipment, while our digital photography is no longer blurry thanks to our ability to design accurate piezoelectric movement sensors. Electronic devices are faster, due to more responsive, tougher screens, and to the use of faster circuits. Meanwhile vehicles are becoming safer and more efficient, thanks to new, lighter, and stronger alloys, composites and glasses. The contributions of materials to an increasingly efficient and sustainable global energy mix deserve special mention: porous carbon or metal oxides help supercapacitors harness and deliver power in the brake systems of hybrid vehicles, for example, while silicon or perovskite photovoltaics make solar power a reality, and the hydrogen economy has a real chance to thrive thanks to the platinum electrodes deployed in fuel cells. Composites are meanwhile helping us to better harness wind energy, while progress made in the developing of lithium batteries means better mobile power: lighter, longer-living, faster-charging, and safer. The resulting social and economic benefits are not restricted to emerging high-tech industries; established sectors are also greatly impacted by advanced materials when it comes to drill bits, cutting equipment, functional coatings, and a wealth of structural materials that are creating value for the manufacturing, aerospace, and the oil and gas industries. In terms of healthcare delivery, ceramics and glass devices are being used to facilitate less invasive strategies that enable the healing of bones and chronic wounds, and implant materials are being made with antibacterial properties that reduce our reliance on antibiotics. In addition, nanoparticles are showing promise in targeted cancer therapies, while shape memory alloys and polymers are enabling the use of smart stents to better treat cardiovascular disease.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.4"
"4.390","Inclusive Cities","","The United Nations projects that the global urban population will increase from 4 billion in 2015 to 5.1 billion by 2030. Residents of growing cities around the world, including artists, are being displaced for economic reasons. This is unfortunate, because those cities where residents can continue to coexist irrespective of income, ethnicity, religion, age, physical ability, sexual orientation, or immigration status provide enormous opportunities for the sort of interaction that enriches the cultural and economic fabric. From Mumbai to San Francisco, cities have developed into hubs for creativity, commerce and culture - while offering the promise of a better life to families fleeing from conflict and poverty. However, cities can also be home to inequality and deprivation. The UN’s Sustainable Development Goals call for “inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable” cities, while the “New Urban Agenda” agreed to at a 2016 UN conference provides related policy guidance. In 2020, urbanists will convene at the World Urban Forum in Abu Dhabi, to discuss topics including the use of technology and data to enable more sustainable cities. Related advances like autonomous vehicles offer opportunities to re-purpose streets in more human-centric ways, and to incorporate mobility options that benefit everyone. In response to rapid urbanization, designers, architects, artists, and communities are formulating innovative approaches. In Medellín, Colombia, former Mayor Sergio Fajardo determined that the most beautiful public buildings should be built in the poorest areas, transforming the city from one of the world’s most dangerous into a more inclusive metropolis. Elevated cable cars now link outer settlements to Medellin’s central metro system, while libraries and cultural centres support civic participation. In other cities, “social practice"" artists are shining a spotlight on urban inequality and revealing our shared humanity. The French street artist “JR” has displayed photographic portraits in places like the slums of Paris and Nairobi, and in Israel and Palestine, which engage viewers with the larger-than-life faces of ordinary people who might otherwise remain relatively hidden. In the urban US and much of the industrialized world, income inequality, housing costs, and limited public transportation are decreasing social mobility, as social and spatial segregation and climate change create serious challenges. Local residents, designers, artists, and advocates in affected areas are working to create more sustainable and inclusive barrios, neighbourhoods and boroughs. Chicago-based artist Theaster Gates, for example, transforms vacant properties in an under-served neighbourhood into community-art spaces for residents. This key issue was curated in partnership with Cynthia E. Smith, Curator of Socially Responsible Design at Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.13"
"4.391","Inclusive Consumption","","Despite technology advances that have boosted connectivity and awareness worldwide, digital divides continue to blunt consumer aspirations. About 10% of adults in the US still do not use the internet, according to a 2019 report published by the Pew Research Center, due to race (blacks and Hispanics are more likely than whites to report that they never go online), age (nearly a third of people 65 or older remain offline), and education (nearly a third of adults without high school degrees are offline). Meanwhile in India, less than one-fifth of people in rural areas have access to the internet - compared with nearly 65% in urban areas, according to a report published by the World Economic Forum in 2019. In addition to social value, there is commercial value in bridging these divides. For example, “poor dreamers” in India have the most materialistic aspirations in the country, according to the Forum report, but represent only 8% of consumption there, while the “poor rural” population represents just 11% of consumption despite making up 29% of the population. Getting these people online could create unprecedented commercial opportunities. For that to happen, infrastructure development must be a priority. In India, for example, there is a need to improve banking infrastructure (in the form of ATMs and bank branches), and road connectivity to urban centres for rural dwellers, according to the Forum’s report. Another key to bridging divides and advancing inclusive, consumption-driven growth will be improving job security - and preserving disposable income. About 14% of existing jobs could disappear as a result of automation in the next 15 to 20 years, according to an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development report published in 2019. This has implications not just for the ability of people to remain employed, but also to remain active consumers. The consumer and retail industry itself is at particular risk of technological disruption, even as it continues to employ large numbers of people (there were nearly 4.9 million retail sales worker jobs in the US alone in 2016, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data). Yet, only about 20% of low-skilled workers in the world in sectors like retail take part in training, according to the OECD report, compared with more than 60% of high-skilled workers.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.57"
"4.392","Inclusive Education Design","","Truly inclusive learning involves curricula and experiences designed for a diverse array of abilities, learning styles, cultural backgrounds, and gender identities. Universal Design in Education is a practice that originated at the Center for Universal Design in the US, and is now being applied to everything from textbooks and websites to laboratory equipment; in terms of physical space, it can take the form of entrances that deploy sensors in order to be used with ease by both disabled and non-disabled students, for example. When it comes to the internet, the World Wide Web Consortium’s Web Accessibility Initiative seeks to ensure that sites are compatible with assistive technologies like voice-recognition software. Universal Design for Learning has also been instrumental for inclusive learning; this framework, promoted by the Center for Applied Special Technology, includes three basic principles: multiple means of presenting information, multiple means of motivating students, and multiple means for students to demonstrate that they are learning - ranging from a traditional essay to green screens and podcasts. Both of these models can foster skills necessary not only for school, but also for post-graduation life. The terms “integration” and “inclusion” are often (confusingly) used interchangeably. When it comes to disabled people, specifically, “integration” refers to at least partial physical placement of disabled learners in mainstream schools and training programmes. Meanwhile “inclusion” involves the broader process of changing social norms, values, and attitudes, while addressing unconscious biases and stigma, and adapting policies and practices in schools and training centres accordingly. In a world where change is occurring more rapidly, driven by science and innovation, inclusive education must leverage technology to bolster the cause of universal access and increasingly personalized learning; video conferencing, virtual reality, and digital courses are redefining when and where learning takes place, and paving the way for greater flexibility and access (a report published by the National Center for Education Statistics in the US showed the number of post-secondary students taking at least some courses online increasing by 5.7% between 2016 and 2017, while the percentage of all students enrolled exclusively in online courses rose to 15.4% from 14.7%). Artificial intelligence, gamification, and accessibility technologies are also enabling more personalized and interactive instruction.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.76"
"4.393","Inclusive Growth","","Chile’s sustained economic progress and targeted public spending have significantly advanced inclusive growth, and the country’s pioneering related efforts have become regional benchmarks. Chile was one of the first countries in Latin America to offer free healthcare and education, it has developed a rich social protection scheme, and it has adopted targeted measures to address vulnerable populations. Improving income levels have contributed to a significant reduction in poverty in Chile, to a rate of less than 3%. That compares with a rate of nearly 20% between 1985 and 1994. Chile’s unemployment rate in 2017, 6.7%, compared favourably with other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) members. These achievements have been accompanied by an expansion of infrastructure investment. According to a 2015 report from the World Bank, between 2009 and 2013 Chile’s less well-off households benefited more from economic growth than the average individual in the country; real income per capita for the bottom 40% of the population grew 5.6% during the period, while the overall mean growth rate was 4.1%. The World Economic Forum’s Inclusive Growth and Development Report 2017 ranked Chile second within its peer group in terms of health services. In terms of education and skills, the country ranked 7th in its group of 20, and when it came to social protection Chile’s score placed it 14th out of 26. However, in this same report from the Forum, Chile’s weakest points included market influence, ownership of land, and banking-sector assets that are concentrated among relatively few players, in addition to inequality in rural areas, and varied socio-economic conditions for schools. Inequality has been persistent, highlighting a need to boost social and economic inclusion broadly. According to statistics from the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, Chile’s public expenditures increased from an equivalent of 14.2% of GDP in 2000 to 16% by 2015. Still, the country’s public spending remains at about half of the OECD average. In order to achieve more inclusive growth, Chile needs to focus on regional gaps and indigenous communities, on better fostering immigration, and on gender inequality - particularly in relation to the participation of women in the economy. Even as global labour productivity grew by 74% between 1973 and 2013, worker compensation grew by just 12.5% over the same period, according to the Economic Policy Institute. While a relatively recent slowdown in global productivity has contributed to the reduction of the real value of salaries, other forces are also at work - such as rapid technological change, evolving market structures, and globalization, all of which began impacting distribution patterns even before the productivity slowdown. As a result, levels of social inclusion have either deteriorated or remained unchanged in 20 of 29 advanced economies around the world over the past five years, according to the World Economic Forum’s Inclusive Development Index 2018. According to the index, which measured 103 countries’ economic performance using several dimensions in addition to GDP, the advanced economies surveyed failed to collectively increase inclusion (measured by median household income, poverty, and wealth and income inequality) during the past five years, even as they increased their average “growth and development” score by more than 3%.   Statistics like these have led to the emergence of a global consensus on the need for a more inclusive, sustainable model of growth and development. Enhancing inclusiveness is a long-term process, which requires long-lasting commitments among stakeholders including governments, businesses, and civil society organizations in order to mobilize resources and effort. Policy-makers need to place people and their standard of living at the centre of their strategies. Investment in education and income redistribution mechanisms, for example, can help to bridge the opportunity gap between rich and poor - though they will not be solely sufficient to achieve a more sustainable model. This will require a deeper rethinking of business models and public policy. World Bank research suggests that the economies that manage to achieve relatively good standards of inclusive growth also tend to adopt land reforms, actively support small- and medium-sized businesses, invest generously in education, and insulate policy-making from corruption. However, despite the consensus on a need for more inclusive growth, little in the way of concrete policy guidance has emerged. Greater multi-stakeholder efforts are therefore needed in order to create effective economic institutions, and to develop incentives that support growth and productivity.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","['1.29', '1.58']"
"4.394","Inclusive Growth and Sustainable Development","","Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states vary greatly in terms of wealth. Singapore’s GDP per capita in 2017 was $57,714, compared with $1,298 in Myanmar, according to World Bank data. Still, lower-income states have made gains. In 2011, the World Bank moved the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (or Laos) out of the low-income country lending group, and into lower-middle-income status; the same occurred for Myanmar in 2015, and for Cambodia in 2016. This has been coupled with other advances; in 2015, the United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation reported that since 1990, ASEAN countries and Timor-Leste (or East Timor) had reduced their child mortality rate by 62%. In addition, the World Health Organization’s 2015 Asia Water Watch noted that these countries would meet millennium development goal targets for water and sanitation in urban areas. Significant differences remain, however. According to the World Bank’s 2017 Global Findex report, 98% of adults in Singapore had a bank account, compared with just 22% in Cambodia. And while Singapore ranked second in the World Bank’s 2017 Doing Business index, Myanmar was 170th.  These disparities illustrate the need for broad, robust investment in infrastructure, financial institutions, and strategic planning. The need to better integrate financially weaker ASEAN states into the global economy is more important than ever. With the advent of the technology-driven Fourth Industrial Revolution, much needs to be done to ensure that the poor and marginalized in the region are able to benefit from related changes. Each member state faces unique challenges; the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report 2017-2018 noted that while Malaysia’s most problematic factors for doing business include foreign currency regulations, Viet Nam’s include corruption and an inadequately-educated workforce. Other challenges are shared by the community as a whole; the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals Report 2015 registered only a slight increase in the number of female members of parliament in Southeast Asia, from 12% in 2000 to 18% in 2015. There are unique opportunities to expand economic prosperity in the region, however. For example, with the exception of Myanmar and the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Laos), ASEAN has a ratio of more than one mobile phone per person. An economic model that can leverage such attributes, and integrate the poor and vulnerable, is the way forward for ASEAN and the responsibility of all member states.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.2"
"4.395","Inclusive Labour Markets","","The vast number of educated, motivated people who are nonetheless unemployed, underemployed, or stuck in low-quality employment highlights the need for better ways of connecting talent to economic opportunity. Though it may depend on the specific challenges shaping a particular labour market, related efforts should generally involve enabling people from a variety of circumstances and backgrounds to gain access to better professional networks. Young people in particular could benefit from new digital platforms, which can enable connections and help unlock greater potential for accessing talent. The World Economic Forum’s 2018 edition of its Future of Jobs report highlighted the need to effectively manage the transformation of work, as new technologies re-configure work and replace workers entirely. At the same time, it is essential to make the opportunities that continue to exist to obtain increasingly in-demand jobs in high-skilled, technology-intensive fields accessible based purely on merit - regardless of age, gender, or origin. The Forum’s 2017 Global Gender Gap Report revealed the degree to which gender-polarized educational specialization is fuelling industry-level gender imbalances. The gender gap in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education remains wide, for example. STEM-related fields include engineering, manufacturing and Construction (EMC), and information and communication technology (ICT). According to the 2017 Global Gender Gap Report, globally, 19% of male university graduates pursue EMC degrees, and 7% pursue ICT degrees. By way of contrast, only 6% of female graduates pursue EMC degrees, and 3% study ICT. It is critical that as they examine the scale of STEM gender gaps, decision-makers pay close attention to where these gaps are situated; currently, efforts to close the gender gap in terms of software skills is not matched by equivalent attention to women’s unequal participation in EMC-related specialization, for example. This imbalance undercuts the ability of employers to include women on an equal footing when recruiting in tech-specialized fields. Still, there is more to addressing inclusion than simply reforming education; research has shown that qualified women often exit technology industries because they have concerns about the workplace environment. Other analyses have highlighted a lack of ethnic diversity and ageism prevalent in some of today’s most lucrative and fast-growing industries. In 2016, for example, a judge conditionally certified a class action lawsuit against Google alleging that it declined to hire qualified job candidates because they were too old.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.135"
"4.396","Inclusive Work Practices","","Women have made great strides in terms of their professional lives. But they are still underrepresented in leadership positions, the gender pay gap persists, and too often they are marginalized within industries and across labour markets. Gender equality will only be achieved when both sexes are able to access and enjoy the same rewards, resources, and opportunities. Many studies have highlighted the statistically significant relationship between companies that have women in their upper ranks, and companies with positive financial performance. In addition, women’s active political leadership and women’s broader economic participation are correlated. In general, women’s greater engagement fosters greater credibility for institutions, and more active participation in public life, as noted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in a 2014 analysis. Gender-related power imbalances and safety issues in the workplace have gained increased visibility recently, with revelations of sexual harassment and abuse in several areas of public and professional life, and with the related #MeToo and #TimesUp movements. Increasingly, there are calls to convert this momentum into tangible change in the workplace. Companies can commit to related action, embed best practices, and scale up strong initiatives in a number of ways. As described in the World Economic Forum’s 2017 report Accelerating Gender Parity: A Toolkit, they can obtain high-level buy in by clearly communicating the rationale for gender parity, understanding their specific gender gaps, acknowledging bias, and setting targets to monitor change. Best practices to address the pay gap can include establishing an evolution of performance reviews, women’s sponsoring of other women, eliminating sexual harassment, and training managers to lead diverse teams. Meanwhile effective support for work-life balance can involve providing parental leave allowances that are systematically and consistently implemented, and by expanding leave policy to non-parents. The advent of new strategies, budgets, and structures always has the potential to damage hard-won parity achievements organizations. Leaders should therefore consider any new policy and program through a gender lens, in order to ensure consistent progress. While improving workplace practices may require significant effort in the short-term, the subsequent, long-term expansion of opportunities for women can transform company performance. This is particularly critical now, in light of the technology developments associated with the Fourth Industrial Revolution that are impacting businesses; maintaining diversity will be essential to sufficiently foster related innovation, and manage change.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.63"
"4.397","Inconspicuous Consumption","","The global financial crisis roughly a decade ago altered the consumer economy. One of the best examples is found in the US, where people in top income groups are now spending less on material goods, and more on services and experiences that enhance their quality of life and inter-generational mobility, according to University of Southern California Professor Elizabeth Currid-Halkett’s 2017 book The Sum of Small Things: A Theory of the Aspirational Class. According to the book, middle class consumers have seized on cheaper goods to spend increasing amounts relative to their total income, while spending on material goods among people in the top and low-income groups has declined since 1996. Even as they curtail spending on material goods, however, according to Currid-Halkett’s book, people in the highest income groups have dramatically increased spending on inconspicuous investments that can enhance well-being and create opportunity - such as retirement planning, health insurance, and education. In her book, Currid-Halkett describes these US consumer patterns as a function of specific trends: due to the mass-production economy, for example, material consumption is cheaper and more accessible to many people, boosting the omnipresence of material goods while reducing their luxury appeal; in addition, the global economy places a greater emphasis on goods and services that can increase upward mobility, so increased spending on education is a reflection of this value system. And, an increasingly productivity-focused global economy places a premium on consumption that facilitates leisure time, thus an increase in spending on things like housekeeping, gardeners, or childcare that replaces spending on things like handbags, televisions, and other material goods. However, such immaterial consumption generally costs much more than conventional material goods. That limits the ability to spend on retirement or a prestigious college education to only the top income groups (as economist Raj Chetty and his colleagues reported in a 2017 Equality of Opportunity Project paper, children born into the top 1% income group are 77 times more likely than other children to attend an Ivy League university). The implications of such consumer trends are unsettling; they will likely increase socioeconomic inequality, and sustain a small, privileged elite.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.114"
"4.398","Increased Consumer Expectations","","Digitally-enabled consumers are affecting how products are developed and delivered; they expect faster delivery times, better quality, and more personalized items. They are also increasingly getting involved in the process of related innovation and creation. The net effect is that we are moving towards demand-driven production and supply chains - that is, more efficient and on-demand production in response to a specific need, rather than making things that may or may not appeal to a large number of people. One particular demand increasingly being made by consumers is for more sustainable and reusable products. They also increasingly want transparency in terms of that sustainability (or lack thereof) when it comes to the items showing up on their plates, in their shopping carts, and in their homes. This presents new opportunities for manufacturers. Procter & Gamble, for example, unveiled its first-ever fully recyclable shampoo bottle, made from recycled beach plastic, at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos in 2017 - and won a United Nations Momentum for Change Award for its efforts. Consumer products giant Unilever published a report in 2017 showing that a third of shoppers now choose to buy products from brands they believe are doing social or environmental good - and one in five would actively choose brands if they made their sustainability credentials clearer on their packaging. Unilever added that its own brands that have integrated sustainability, such as Ben & Jerry’s ice cream, had been responsible for half of the company’s growth in 2015. According to a Nielsen estimate, the value of sustainable product sales in the US alone is projected to increase to $150 billion by 2021, from $107 billion in 2014.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.3"
"4.399","Increasing Surveillance of Citizens","","With the advent of social media, the internet has become one of the primary civic spaces for organizing and coordinating dissent. However, due the increasing online surveillance of activists, and to the severe punishments being handed out to whistle­blowers, many organizers of social movements are reverting to offline planning and coordination. According to the results of a study published in the Berkeley Technology Law Journal in 2016, revelations about US National Security Agency online surveillance in 2013 caused a significant decline in traffic to privacy-sensitive Wikipedia articles, demonstrating how government surveillance can impact online activity. The revelations about the NSA caused privacy advocates to wonder if the role of the internet as a whole as a tool for free speech and assembly might be diminished. The case of Edward Snowden, the whistleblower responsible for the NSA revelations who has evaded arrest and is now living in exile in Russia, is also believed to have had a chilling effect on the use of online tools to organize and draw attention to perceived injustices. DeRay Mckesson, an activist and supporter of Black Lives Matter in the US, told a reporter in 2015 that he assumed the government was reading all of the group’s communications. However, Mckesson and other Black Lives Matter activists have not shied away from social media, and continue to rely heavily on Twitter, for example. Some activists have actually proactively used social media to dupe authorities, and facilitate their offline activity; during Arab Spring protests in Bahrain and Egypt in 2011, for example, activists used Twitter to post where activity would supposedly be occurring in order to lure police there, then used phone calls or face-to-face communication to move the activity to another location, according to a report published by USAID in 2016. However, many activists and others interested in particular issues have simply avoided using the internet to organize or educate themselves, due to privacy concerns. A study published by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration in the US in 2016 found that 29% of households responding to a survey indicated they were concerned about government data collection, and therefore refrained from expressing controversial or political opinions online.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.33"
"4.400","India’s Missing Infrastructure","","Infrastructure development in India has been poorly planned and executed, hamstringing the country’s transition from lower-middle-income economy. According to the government’s 2017-18 Economic Survey, India requires nearly $4.5 trillion in investment by 2040 to meet its infrastructure needs. Based on existing trends, this is unlikely to happen. The consequences are many; adequate power and transportation infrastructure is essential for strengthening India’s troubled manufacturing sector, for example. Historically, countries like China and Japan have shown that heavy investment in infrastructure, coupled with a healthy manufacturing base, can generate rapid growth - while research has established the crucial role infrastructure investment has played in other countries around the world. The absence of infrastructure development means India’s export competitiveness is weakened, as is the ability of domestic Indian firms, which are predominantly small, to scale up. Not least, the failure to provide adequate infrastructure has a degrading effect on the quality of the labour force, by depriving people of the basic prerequisites for participating in a modern economy - such as the roads they need to commute, and the reliable electricity they need to keep the lights on at home. So far, India’s private sector has failed to bridge the infrastructure gap. While infrastructure companies’ high debt levels and an inability of banks to lend have slowed the pace of investment considerably, the public-private partnership model widely used for funding projects elsewhere has stalled; inefficient and inequitable allocation of risk may be a major factor in this failure. Over the past two decades, successive governments in India have attempted to boost infrastructure development. And, there has been reasonable progress in some areas - such as rural electrification, and the road and highway network. The government’s allowance of as much as 100% foreign direct investment in the domestic road sector may also help, particularly now that new, more viable infrastructure project funding models such as “hybrid annuity” are gaining steam. But significant challenges remain: public investment in infrastructure is constrained by simple fiscal math, and relaxing the norms of foreign direct investment, or floating new models for partnering with the private sector, will have limited impact without corresponding regulatory reform, the presence of strong dispute resolution mechanisms, and greater clarity on contentious issues such as land acquisition.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.77"
"4.401","India’s New Data Economy","","The datafication and digitalization of the global economy pose unique opportunities and challenges for developing countries like India. They can each play critical roles in catalysing financial inclusion, boosting innovation and productivity, and generating inclusive economic growth. But without the right regulatory frameworks and digital infrastructure, they also have the potential to create skewed markets where economic benefits accrue to the few and not the many. India’s digital economy has enormous potential. It is one of the fastest growing in the world and features the second-largest (behind China) digital consumer base - made up of more than 1.2 billion mobile phone users and 560 million internet subscriptions. The pace has been frenetic; over 207 million Indians got online between 2013 and 2017, as smartphone adoption quadrupled. The digital payments sector provides one demonstration of the economic effects of this mass digitalization. It is expected to more than double in size from $64.8 billion in 2019 to $135.2 billion by 2023, thanks to a compound annual growth rate of 20.2%. Regulating such markets can be tricky, because they possess unique attributes like vast economies of scale, network effects, and minimal marginal costs. A lack of clarity about data ownership and collection, and the complex, data-based business models of companies such as Google and Facebook that offer “free” products and services further muddy the waters. Regulation that is too lax can facilitate unhealthy business practices, skewed growth, and the creation of a digital elite. Overly harsh regulation, meanwhile, can stifle innovation and undercut the potential benefits of datafication. Indian policy-makers and industry groups have taken steps to address this challenge. They are putting the building blocks of soft digital infrastructure in place, including the Account Aggregator (for synchronizing financial information), the United Payments Interface, DigiLocker (cloud-based accounts for citizens), and Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture. This “IndiaStack” architecture has the potential to spur inclusive economic activity and empower people. Regulators are still grappling with critical issues such as personal data protection and digital competition, however, and much remains to be done to create regulatory frameworks that are tailored to India instead of simply borrowed from other economies. Given the rapidly growing nature of India’s digital economy, it is critical that policy-makers seek to maximize benefits while minimizing potential harm.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.77"
"4.402","Indigenous Peoples","","Australia’s First Peoples (Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders) constitute 3.3% of the country’s total population of roughly 24.5 million, and have one of the oldest living cultures in human history. White settlement has profoundly impacted all aspects of their lives. The legacy of 200 years of systemic racism is that the majority of Indigenous Australians, particularly in remote areas, remain disadvantaged and impoverished. Indigenous mortality rates are relatively high, as are reported rates of diabetes, heart disease, smoking-related cancer, alcoholism, and psychological distress. Unemployment and under-employment rates are also high, especially among young people in remote communities. Imprisonment rates are 12 times higher than those for Australia’s adult population as a whole, and juvenile detention is 24 times more likely than it is for non-Indigenous citizens. Meanwhile school retention rates are relatively low, as are the numbers of students completing university studies. Government programmes meant to address injustice and inequality are rarely based on actual consultation with affected communities, and are often criticized. In addition, government policy has failed to recognize the relevance of Indigenous cultural institutions and modes of governance to improving resource management and sustainable development. Since the 1960s, civil rights campaigns have drawn increasing numbers of Indigenous and non-Indigenous activists together to press for government action. In a 1967 referendum, Australians voted to include Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders in the census; in the 1970s, legislation recognized Aborigines as traditional landowners; in 1992, the High Court of Australia recognized the historic land claims of Indigenous peoples in a landmark case; and, in 1996, the court ruled that pastoral leases (where public land is leased for grazing) do not necessarily extinguish native title rights. In 2008, then-Prime Minister Kevin Rudd formally apologized to Australia’s First Peoples for laws and policies that had inflicted suffering and loss, and committed to improving Indigenous life expectancy, child mortality rates, access to early childhood education, educational achievement, and employment. While an increasing number of non-Indigenous Australians see reconciliation and Indigenous rights as a national responsibility, progress has been slow. Adequately ensuring that First Peoples have a voice in public debate continues to be a point of contention. In 2017, a constitutional convention brought together more than 250 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders. The majority called for a “First Nations Voice” in the Australian Constitution (later rejected by former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull), and for a process of related agreement-making and truth-telling.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.14"
"4.403","Industrial Biotechnology","","Industrial Biotechnology, also known as “white” biotechnology, involves the sustainable production of chemicals, pharmaceuticals, food, fibres, textiles, and energy. White biotechnology is often referred to as the third wave of biotechnology, following “red” biotechnology (medical-related) and “green” biotechnology (agriculture-related), and it has become a powerful means to address climate change, mounting energy demand, the depletion of fossil-fuel resources, and environmental issues including petroleum-based plastics and micro-plastics pollution. The field’s underpinning technologies are mainly based on the engineering of microbial hosts, and it has been boosted over the course of the past decade by scientific breakthroughs in metabolic engineering, synthetic and systems biology, and advanced cultivation techniques. In particular, the recent establishment of systems metabolic engineering (combining metabolic engineering with systems biology, synthetic biology, and evolutionary engineering) has led to a dramatic advances. Through the comprehensive optimization of existing methods, and the creation of new methods, the spectrum of possible commercial products has been expanded dramatically - including healthy food products that can be used to combat malnutrition in impoverished parts of the world. Compared with traditional, fossil fuel-based chemical processes, an industrial biotechnology process completed via a single fermentation can be a way to make relatively affordable products that help protect the environment. As a result, the total industrial biotechnology market is expected to grow at a rate of nearly 9% annually, and reach a total size of $472.3 billion by the end of 2025. According to a study published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, The Bioeconomy to 2030: Designing a Policy Agenda, industrial biotechnology will account for 39% of all economic value generated by biotechnology by the year 2030. Bioethylene, for example, is expected to account for as much as 40% of all plastic polyethylene production by 2035 - and production of biodegradable polylactic acid, usable for everything from decomposable packaging material to medical implants, is expected to reach 800,000 tonnes by 2020, according to the International Energy Agency and International Renewable Energy Agency. Ultimately, industrial biotechnology can make a major contribution to achieving United Nations Sustainable Development Goals related to fostering affordable and clean energy, sustainable cities and communities, and responsible consumption and production.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.22"
"4.404","Industrial Model and Innovation","","Germany’s innovation capacity is highly concentrated in the electrical, machinery and automotive sectors, making it particularly vulnerable to related shifts in market demand and disruptive technology. Germany was ranked 9th out of 127 countries in the 2018 edition of the Global Innovation Index, which is compiled by a consortium of business schools, unchanged from 2017 but a slight improvement over its 10th place ranking in 2016. The country ranked first in the 2018 index in terms of both logistics performance and patents by origin, and second in terms of private sector research & development spending. However, Germany’s innovation capacity varies greatly among states; the eastern states generally lag behind the industrially strong south, with the exception of the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt. Risk factors for Germany in relation to its innovation capacity include complacency on university reforms, and a growing exodus of highly-trained academics to countries with more internationalized research infrastructure - and better career prospects. In addition, the integration of the immigrant workforce in Germany needs to be improved, through better education and equality of opportunity. Education mandates in the country are decentralized to the German states, which results in a wide variety in terms of quality. A more coordinated, long-term approach to education is required to meet the changing needs of the German economy. Particularly when it comes to startups and startup culture, the country’s Ministry of Economic Affairs has identified significant risk-adversity in Germany’s economic culture as a key challenge - and is trying to facilitate cultural change.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.66"
"4.405","Inequality","","Worsening inequality, and a corresponding negative impact on social stability, is one of the greatest potential risks associated with the technology innovation propelling the Fourth Industrial Revolution. While new technologies can democratize access to employment and entrepreneurial opportunities, not to mention education and knowledge, the tendency of new global technology platforms to dominate winner-takes-all markets could exacerbate inequality and social fragmentation. According to the 2017 edition of the Global Wealth Report published by Credit Suisse, total global wealth increased 27% over the course of the prior decade, and slightly more than half of all of the household wealth in the world was owned by just 1% of the global population (when the current millennium had begun, 45.5% of total global wealth was owned by the top 1%, according to the report). Even within the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, as of 2011 the average income of the richest 10% of their populations was about nine times that of the poorest 10%. Inequality within most countries is getting worse, even in places that have enjoyed rapid economic growth across income groups and corresponding declines in poverty. Rising inequality is an economic and a social concern. In their 2009 book The Spirit Level: Why Greater Equality Makes Societies Stronger, British epidemiologists Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett published data indicating that unequal societies tend to be more violent, to have higher numbers of incarcerated citizens, to experience greater levels of mental illness and obesity, and to have lower life expectancy. More equal societies, meanwhile, have higher levels of child well-being, lower levels of stress and drug use, and lower rates of infant mortality. The World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Report 2018 showed strong interconnections between rising income disparity, unemployment or underemployment, and profound social instability. A more digitally-connected world has created higher expectations, which can generate significant social risk if people feel they have no chance to attain the prosperity they see others enjoying. If the Fourth Industrial Revolution does result in greater social exclusion, it may make it even more difficult to find meaning in the modern world - and it may create further disenchantment with established elites and power structures. This could further motivate extremist movements, and augment their recruitment efforts.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.55"
"4.406","Inequality and Development","","About 165 million of the world’s international migrants (nearly two-thirds of the total as of 2017) are being hosted in high-income countries, according to United Nations statistics, while just 11 million live in low-income countries. The most popular migration corridors clearly lead from poorer to wealthier places - as most of the people migrating are doing so in order to seek a better life. They are in search of better incomes and means of securing food and shelter, and they are motivated by factors that are fundamental to the operation of any healthy civil society: the rule of law; safeguards to help prevent or limit corruption; access to health and education services; and protections from human rights abuses. In countries that are significant sources of migration, inequality remains pervasive and in some locations is entrenched. The effects of economic inequality are far reaching; a person’s ability to earn a decent living is overwhelmingly determined simply by the country where he or she lives, and a typical worker in a poor country is about $10,000 less productive annually than he or she would be in a rich country, according to a working paper published by the Center for Global Development in 2016. Local populations have gained ever greater visibility of this inequality, as telecommunications services become increasingly available in traditionally poor and marginalized societies. In Afghanistan, for example, where GDP per capita was still only about $562 as of 2016 (compared with $1,359 in Bangladesh, or $1,710 in India), according to World Bank data, the mobile phone subscription rate surged from 5% as of 2005 to 62% by 2015 - and that was still one of the lowest rates recorded globally. A research paper published in 2012 by the International Migration Institute, based on dozens of interviews with migrants settled in the Netherlands, found that social media and services like Skype played a crucial role in helping people thousands of miles from home to maintain ties to family and friends - and that online media lowered the threshold for people interested in migrating, making it more attractive than it would be otherwise.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.98"
"4.407","Informed, Agile Governance","","The institutions that have traditionally been responsible for shaping the social impact of new technology are struggling to keep up. At the same time, a sharp decline in public confidence is occurring around the world, as trust in mainstream institutions reaches a low point. According to the Edelman Trust Barometer 2018, a survey of thousands of respondents in 28 countries, as a result of a lack of trust in the media’s ability to safeguard the quality of information 56% of people do not know which politicians to trust, 42% do not know which companies or brands to trust, and 59% are not sure what is true and what is not. While 75% of respondents expressed trust in the technology sector, that was a slight decline compared with the prior year. There is an urgent need for a faster, more agile approach to governing emerging technologies - and the business models and social interaction that they enable. A shared understanding of acceptable behaviour is the foundation of trust in any society; the rule of law, and governance, whether related to matters of significance or to something as simple as the colour coding of traffic lights, enable people to pursue their goals with confidence. The architecture and nature of traditional governance mechanisms are inherently challenged when it comes to responding to digital technologies and the internet - due to mismatches in terms of structure and the rate of change. For example, as recently as a couple of years ago, some national digital strategies did not include any reference to artificial intelligence. These challenges call for an evolution of institutional architecture, which should become more adaptive, human-centred, inclusive, and sustainable. Beyond policy and regulation, the evolution of other instruments such as contract law, codes of practice, and industry self-regulation could better provide adequate rules of the road.

"4.409","Infrastructure Gap","","Colombia’s overtaxed infrastructure must be addressed, in order to sustain the country's economic growth and competitiveness. Colombia ranked 109th out of 137 economies in terms of quality of overall infrastructure in the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index 2017-2018; it ranked 110th in terms of quality of roads, and 79th in terms of quality of electricity supply. The country has low road network density compared with others in the region, and depends heavily on road transportation to move freight as the development of rail and river transportation is at an early stage. This translates into relatively high shipping costs, high commodity prices, and high prices for consumer products - all of which undermines productivity and competitiveness. After a long period of neglect, Colombia has seen a recent increase in both public and private infrastructure investment. Key projects have included the Ruta del Sol highway that connects the nation’s capital with large urban areas in the country's interior, and with the Caribbean coast. The Colombian government created the Financiera de Desarrollo Nacional, a semi-public finance institution, which is designed to support infrastructure. The government has also developed a new regulatory framework for public-private partnerships, while steps have been taken to better facilitate capital deployment to public infrastructure, as well as to bolster efficiency and transparency in the bidding for projects.. In 2013, the government introduced the so-called fourth-generation (4G) program, which involves more than 30 concession projects, and the construction of more than 1,200 kilometres of highway. As part of the programme, the government set investment targets of approximately $25 billion for road infrastructure, and up to $100 billion for transport infrastructure, by 2021. In early 2018, a number of related projects were awarded, and the government expects them to help reduce travel times by up to half while boosting Colombia's GDP growth by 1.5% per year. In order to support the 4G programme, the infrastructure sector must be increasingly professionalized, regulations must be modified to unlock additional investment capital, and solid guarantees must be provided to long-term investors.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.35"
"4.410","Infrastructure Investment","","The travel and tourism industry contributes roughly 10% of global GDP, and accounts for about 300 million jobs, according to a report published by the World Travel & Tourism Council in 2017. However, private and public infrastructure investments in airport development, accommodation, roads, railways, and communication technologies lag behind industry growth, leading to significant bottlenecks and limiting potential development and employment opportunities. Airports and border controls need to become smarter, and travel infrastructure must become leaner, in order to meet the needs of travellers who want to move around securely and seamlessly. The World Economic Forum's Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report emphasizes the importance of infrastructure for every country’s travel and tourism competitiveness. Some notable improvements among countries assessed in the latest, 2017 edition of the report included India, which moved up 12 places compared with the previous edition due in part to improved ground transportation infrastructure, which has traditionally been a challenge there, and Viet Nam, which moved up eight places and was cited for improvements in information technology infrastructure. There is a need for greater dialogue between the public and private sectors in every country, in order to ensure an integrated infrastructure strategy.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.16"
"4.411","Infrastructure Technology and Innovation","","More actively embracing new technologies is not only a way to potentially improve existing infrastructure, but also a key potential means of closing an infrastructure investment gap expected to reach $22 billion in India, $100 billion in China, and $162 billion in the US by the year 2030, according to the Global Infrastructure Hub. Due to the economic and political importance of infrastructure projects, and related sensitivities, developers and investors are often hesitant to incorporate emerging technology into their planning. As a result, the engineering and construction industry remains among the least digitally transformed, leading to project delays, poor design, environmental damage, and ballooning costs. This is happening even as emerging technologies have the potential to transform entire infrastructure systems through the use of advanced materials, robotics, 3D printing, the Internet of Things (which strings devices and appliances together via an internet connection), and data analytics. Examples of the impact of technology on construction include China-based Broad Sustainable Building’s construction of a 57-story tower in just 19 days in 2014 - in part by using advanced prefabrication techniques. Building Information Modeling (BIM) is another example of helpful innovation, thanks to the way it enables developers to create data-based, digital 3D models of projects so that architects, engineers, and contractors can simultaneously collaborate. This potentially increases efficiency and quality, while reducing errors, delays, and costs. Better integrating new technology into infrastructure development could not only result in more badly-needed infrastructure, but also in more sustainable and efficient infrastructure. Drone deliveries could take vehicles and related emissions off the road, autonomous vehicles could boost road capacity, and more digital tracking of road use could help to better predict the need for new infrastructure, according to a report published by the McKinsey Global Institute in 2016. However, new regulatory and business models will need to be created in order to pave the way for new technologies, while the general thinking about infrastructure development should shift to more strongly emphasize connectivity between mobility and utility systems, and between living and work spaces (particularly in urban environments).","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.79"
"4.412","Infrastructure as a Geopolitical Tool","","By early 2019, China’s Belt and Road initiative, unveiled roughly five years earlier, had spawned projects including a $3 billion railway between Budapest and Belgrade, several nuclear reactors in Pakistan, and a $2 billion industrial park in Kenya, according to the think tank Bruegel. Some analysts see the initiative as an unsettling extension of China’s rising power, according to a report published by the Council on Foreign Relations. The report noted that more than 60 countries, accounting for two-thirds of the global population, had signed on to Belt and Road projects or had expressed an interest in doing so by early 2019, and it cited estimates that China may spend $1.3 trillion on the initiative by 2027. The report detailed a significant potential return on that investment in the form of an increased ability to shape international norms and institutions, and to generally assert China’s interests more aggressively on the global stage. However, there has been some pushback; an analysis published by Bruegel in 2019 flagged particularly negative public perception of the initiative in several countries that are home to Belt and Road projects, including Poland and Ukraine.  Interference with the ability of firms from overseas to participate in infrastructure-building can also be wielded as a geopolitical tool. The US, for example, has sought in recent years to discourage other countries from selecting China-based Huawei to build important telecommunications infrastructure. The US has argued that equipment supplied by Huawei, which is a leader in terms of the technology and intellectual property required to deploy next-generation 5G networks, represents a security threat - though the company has denied that. The US campaign has managed to help dissuade governments in Australia and New Zealand from pushing ahead with projects that use Huawei gear, though Germany has signaled an openness to deploying technology from the company, and the United Kingdom has reportedly approved the use of Huawei products in non-core parts of its 5G infrastructure. The wrangling over infrastructure vendors can have far-reaching geo-economic effects; after Canada arrested a senior Huawei executive in 2018 at the behest of the US for allegedly violating sanctions against Iran, China banned imports of Canadian canola and potentially eliminated a significant portion of Canada’s global exports of the seed that totaled $8.6 billion in 2018.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.79"
"4.413","Infrastructure at Capacity","","Switzerland has been known for its innovative, high quality infrastructure since the railroad boom of the 19th century - when the Gotthard railway was laced through the Swiss Alps. When the country’s infrastructure networks were designed (the highway system in the 1960s, the airports in the 1940s), they included relatively generous capacities. By 2010, the Swiss infrastructure network consisted of 1,790 kilometres of highway, 3,011 kilometres of federal railway tracks, 2,137 private railway tracks, three national airports (Zurich, Geneva, and Basel), 532 hydro power stations, five nuclear power stations, 6,696 kilometres of high voltage supply lines, in addition to a high pressure gas network and communications network. The condition of national infrastructure networks is still generally good, which contributes to Switzerland’s competitiveness. But most of the networks also have critical capacity issues. The country’s train system is one of the most highly utilized in the world, and the Zurich airport has one of the highest rates of delayed flights - while many hours are wasted in traffic jams on the country’s congested motorways. While neighbouring countries have developed new infrastructure networks featuring high speed train systems and new motorways and airports, Switzerland’s plans to accommodate its expanding population do not include a major capacity increase in form of major new infrastructure. Significant capacity constraints are projected for air transport, as the country has only three international runways, of which two are not independently operable. The government’s strategy involves maintaining existing infrastructure networks, which can be optimized using new technologies such as digitalization to relieve capacity problems. Important exceptions include the two new Alpine tunnels crossing beneath the Lötschberg and Gotthard mountains, as part of a European corridor stretching from north to south. Meanwhile significant investments are being made in public transportation systems in big cities, in order to extend commuter railway and tram systems; this should have a positive impact on the cities’ places in the knowledge economy, while helping to maintain the quality of life.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.125"

"4.415","Innovation Drive","","China has managed to develop one of the biggest innovation economies in the world. The country promotes innovation-driven growth by dedicating relevant resources, and providing government policy support for upgrading value chains and improving technology. Significant progress has been made in terms of research & development expenditure, the quantity of awarded patents, and the establishment of scientific demonstration parks and zones. Gross domestic spending on R&D as a percentage of GDP rose to about 2.1% in China by 2016, from 0.9% in 2000, according to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development data; by way of comparison, spending the US over the same period rose only slightly, to about 2.7% from 2.6%, according to the data. E-commerce, social media, and financial technology (or fintech) are all contributing to China’s accelerating innovation. China has also improved local institutional elements such as intellectual property rights, technology transfer (or the bringing of new technologies to market), educational opportunities that emphasizes creativity and critical thinking, and facilitation for entrepreneurs. This institutional development is taking place at the national, provincial and city level; one example is Shenzhen, where the city’s government functions as a service provider and coordinator of innovation, and gives entrepreneurs freedom to be creative. Technology parks and startup incubators and accelerators also play key roles in China, by connecting local resources to entrepreneurs. Related investment has also been directed abroad, with several accelerator programs that mentor and develop startups focused on the Chinese market established in Silicon Valley by 2018 (some of which work directly with the Chinese government); examples include the ZGC Innovation Center. Within vocational and higher education, an increasing number of programs are focusing on entrepreneurship. Some large enterprises are meanwhile incubating entrepreneurial units, in order to develop new products and services, while independent small firms are driving change with their relative speed, agility, and potentially disruptive innovation. However, China is also confronted with challenges, including a relatively low quality of innovation, a talent shortage, inefficient capital markets and resource allocation, a relative lack of management capability at the executive level, a slow transformation of state-owned enterprises, and a top-down innovation model (and mindsets). This key issue is curated in partnership with Han Jian, Co-Director, Centre on China Innovation, China Europe International Business School.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.30"
"4.416","Innovation Readiness","","An ageing global populace calls for innovation geared towards care for older populations. Ageing has immense health-related, social, and economic impacts; left unaddressed, it will create complex and unprecedented burdens for individuals, healthcare systems, and entire countries. Those countries that embrace innovation stand a better chance of coping. The phrase “Innovation Readiness” refers to identifying where innovation in relation to ageing is now happening, and clarifying the barriers to that innovation. It encourages collaborative, public-private efforts, while tapping ageing experts from the realms of science, public policy, advocacy, and industry. The International Chamber of Commerce published a set of principles in late 2015 intended to support the development of policy that enables aging-related innovation, and reduces inefficiency. These include: building investor confidence, training skilled workers in an environment that promotes the exchange of knowledge, opening markets to trade and investment, and ensuring intellectual property. Governments need to adopt long-term strategies that facilitate collaboration among different ministries, and cultivate effective coordination among academia, the public sector, and the private sector. The private sector, however, will only be able to maximize its contribution if governments incentivize innovation with robust and predictable regulation, provide targeted financial support such as tax incentives for research, and ensure sufficient intellectual property rights. Digital health solutions like remote patient monitoring can generate helpful data; the collection and proper use of this information presents opportunities to better predict and meet the challenges of ageing. Meanwhile the cooperation of both domestic and international market participants can accelerate innovation cycles, and efficiency. However, collaboration can be hampered by a lack of agreed-upon standards for data protection, concerns about cost-effectiveness, and ambiguous legal and regulatory frameworks. In the health industry, the integration of different care providers and health services can be challenging - though greater integration of data can enable higher-value medical interventions, and help prioritize decision-making. Innovation can also help ensure the sustainability of health care systems through more efficient use of resources. For example, earlier detection, diagnosis, and enrolment in clinical trials can help expedite research and more effective interventions when it comes to Alzheimer’s disease, and may ultimately lead to a cure.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.7"
"4.417","Innovation Systems","","Innovation tends to involve a lot of players; innovation systems are composed of research institutions, universities, national laboratories, hospitals, corporations, startups, venture capitalists, and patent attorneys. The public sector can play a key role, in the form of funding bodies and intermediary organizations like technology transfer offices and accelerators (programs designed to turn raw startups into young companies). The ways in which these participants interact are complex, and subject to local quirks like tax breaks, regulations, patent treaties, and competition rules. They are also influenced by factors including the availability of codified knowledge (publications and standards). A lot of innovation policy has focused on filling institutional voids, improving innovation capability, and strengthening networks; in some countries, there are dedicated innovation agencies that aim to serve as system fixers by addressing failures in markets and networks, often without preference for specific technologies or sectors. Enterprise Singapore, for example, was formed in the city state in 2018 to champion entrepreneurial innovation while overseeing standards and accreditation. A systemic view can be useful at the local level; people working with startups often refer to ""startup ecosystems,"" for example, to describe the networks of organizations, both private and public, from which young enterprises can draw resources. Many efforts to improve entrepreneurship have focused on enriching these ecosystems with measures designed to facilitate connections and improve density. Innovation systems also exist in a narrower sense - many collective intelligence tools, such as wikis (websites developed and overseen by communities) and prediction markets enable people to make judgments that may be better than otherwise possible. It’s important to note that the notion of an “innovation system” is different from “systems innovation” - the latter refers to the challenges of innovating by re-configuring complex systems, like national health care systems or financial systems, and is often challenging because it requires coordinated action by multiple actors while creating complex feedback loops that lead to unpredictable, and sometimes unintended consequences.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.80"
"4.418","Innovation and Access to Credit","","Peru was able to muster investment in research & development (both public and private) equal to only about 0.12% of the country’s GDP as recently as 2015, according to World Bank data. That was less than a third of the 0.38% of GDP spent in its southern neighbour Chile during that same year, and exactly half of the figure registered in its northern neighbour Colombia. About one third of Peru’s R&D investment comes from the private sector, which is below the Latin American average of 40%. The country ranked 113th out of 137 economies in terms of innovation in the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index 2017-2018, and 80th in terms of business sophistication. In addition to relatively low levels of investment in R&D, the country suffers from issues with the quality of its so-called human capital (or, the relative value of its workforce). The proportion of researchers in the country’s labour force is about one third of the average for Latin America, and a small fraction of the average for Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, according to the Network for Science and Technology Indicators – Ibero-American and Inter-American (RICYT). The relatively small size of companies operating in Peru has also constrained its innovation capacity. According to the country’s Ministry of Production, very small ”micro-” and small enterprises account for 99% of all Peruvian businesses, and employ 60% of the country’s economically-active population. In the broader region surrounding Peru, only between 30% and 40% of the population was employed by micro-enterprises, according to the International Labour Organization’s World Employment and Social Outlook 2015. Peruvian firms generally have difficulty raising financing, due in part to their small size. The country’s so-called financial depth, or contributions of financial institutions to overall GDP, is relatively low. According to a 2015 report published by the World Bank, the cost of credit for small- and medium-sized firms in the country is relatively high; overall, the average lending rate was 16% as of 2013, according to the report, which was high compared with countries at similar stages of development. Overcoming these obstacles for Peruvian companies will require sounder corporate governance.  The increased use of grants to finance innovation efforts could help improve the outlook in Peru, as could better encouragement of joint enterprises between firms and research institutions. Increased incentives could meanwhile help attract talent, and help to bolster domestic innovation.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.106"
"4.419","Innovation and Business Sophistication","","Chile’s transition to a high-income economy will require a more sophisticated, diversified economic structure. A decisive leap forward in research & development capability could be helpful in this regard, though Chile has yet to make innovation a key element of its economic development. The country spent the equivalent of 0.4% of its GDP on R&D as of 2015, which was the lowest among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries and ranked 71st among 110 economies assessed in the Global Innovation Index 2017. Chile scored its lowest marks in the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report 2017-2018 in the areas of business sophistication and innovation - placing 50th and 52nd, respectively, out of 137 economies. Placement was similar in terms of university-industry collaboration in R&D (58th), and quality of scientific research institutions (43rd). The country ranked significantly lower in terms of company spending on R&D (99th) and government procurement of advanced technology products (110th). The Inter-American Development Bank has identified a need for Chile to strengthen its National Council on Innovation for Competitiveness, to clarify the roles and responsibilities of its Inter-Ministerial Council for Innovation, and to improve inter-agency coordination. In addition, it is important for the country to adopt policies that promote innovation among small- and medium-sized enterprises, and to integrate a science, technology and innovation agenda into its long-term development plans.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.29"
"4.420","Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Switzerland","","Switzerland features four languages (German, French, Italian, and Romansh) and distinct cultures, and connects surrounding European countries via its historic traffic routes through the Alps. It has developed a strong education system that combines world-leading post-secondary institutions with a unique vocational training (apprenticeship) system. The Swiss education system represents a healthy balance between bottom-up (market-driven) and top-down (federal) initiatives. While the vocational system is predominantly driven by professional organizations, the post-secondary system is driven by cantons (the state jurisdictions within Switzerland) and by the federal government (when it comes to the federal institutes of technology). The education system is funded by a mix of federal and cantonal subsidies, industry financing, and student contributions. According to the World Economic Forum’s Global Human Capital Report 2017, Switzerland benefits from the high quality of its education system, strong vocational training and a high level of skills diversity. The country ranked 3rd in the overall Human Capital Index (behind Norway and Finland), and was rated best in terms of know-how, and second-best in terms of development. The strength of the Swiss education and training system was demonstrated during the financial crisis, when youth unemployment rates soared in many European countries but remained relatively stable in Switzerland, Germany, and Austria. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Switzerland’s market-driven, vocational and professional education and training system benefits from the strong influence of employers. However, vocational and on-the-job training is becoming less attractive for young people. As a result, various initiatives have been launched to promote dual-education and fight youth unemployment. According to the 2016-2017 Times Higher Education’s World University Rankings and ShanghaiRanking’s Academic Ranking, Swiss institutions such as the two Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology (ETH Zurich and EPF Lausanne) are among the best worldwide. This has contributed to a relatively high proportion of international faculty members and students, which further strengthens the system. However, it has been projected that Switzerland will suffer from a significant lack of skilled employees in the near future. Changes in the job market and dramatic shifts in skills requirements have played a role. The skills mismatch is not unique to Switzerland; the World Economic Forum’s 2017 white paper Realizing Human Potential in the Fourth Industrial Revolution recommends addressing the situation by ensuring there is a sufficient science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education to deliver strong digital skills.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.125"
"4.421","Innovation and Productivity","","Rates of productivity around the world have either declined or remained flat during the past decade, despite exponential increases in both technological progress and investment in innovation. In the US, according the Bureau of Labor Statistics, labour productivity measured in output per hour grew an annual average of 2.4% between 1948 and 1983, then rose to 2.7% between 2000 and 2007, and later fell to 1.3% between 2007 and 2015. In his 2016 book The Rise and Fall of American Growth, the economist Robert Gordon argues that this disconnect between innovation and productivity is the result of innovation that is less beneficial for an economy than the dramatic developments of past industrial revolutions - which revamped entire sanitation, energy, and transportation systems. However, it is also possible that the impact of the Fourth Industrial Revolution on productivity has not yet become fully apparent because it is increasing efficiency in ways that cannot be accurately measured by traditional means. Many new goods and services are non-rival, meaning that they can be repeated again and again without generating more costs; they may also have zero marginal cost to begin with, or they may use digital platforms to lower prices in highly competitive markets. Under these conditions, traditional productivity statistics may fail to capture real increases in value, given that any related price benefit for consumers is not well reflected in corporate sales and profit figures. Another possible explanation: the world has yet to fully experience the productivity explosion being created by the new technologies at the heart of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. This revolution has not yet reached many of the two billion people still disconnected from the global economy, who may ultimately benefit the most from it. Many of the technologies and processes being created to help better manage negative forces like the environmental impact of climate change have not yet been widely implemented. After all, we are still at the beginning of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and few organizations have so far reorganized themselves to take full advantage of it. As with the digital revolution, and other previous industrial revolutions before that, realizing the full benefit of the Fourth Industrial Revolution may take time, and require new organizational forms, new skills, and new mindsets.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.55"
"4.422","Innovation for Nature","","Whether it’s citizen-scientists using cellphones to report on water quality, or drones that warn elephants away from a poacher’s snare, technology can be a powerful means to improve the ways that we manage natural resources. The Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is being propelled by a convergence of technologies, offers new opportunities to shape society’s relationship with nature and create a more sustainable bioeconomy. It also presents significant risks. This industrial revolution has sweeping implications, not least for biotechnology - in particular in terms of the potential for biomimicry (sustainable innovation that mimics nature) and bioprospecting (the use of natural materials to create new products), as well as for improved environmental monitoring and industrial ecology. It also presents opportunities to increase awareness of the need to shift to more sustainable production models, and awareness of the value that nature provides. For example, natural areas and organisms should be valued not just for the materials they provide, but also for the knowledge they confer; the value of compounds found in woodland fungi that provide a blueprint for new antibiotics, for example, may outweigh the value generated by harvesting a forest. By better conserving natural systems that represent billions of years of acquired, biological problem-solving ability, we can enable a Fourth Industrial Revolution that translates knowledge into economic and social value. In order to enable a truly sustainable bioeconomy, however, bold vision is required when it comes to dealing with associated risks - including environmental degradation as a result of economic activity, increased political instability and inequality, and potential bio-piracy. While technologies such as blockchain can improve supply chain monitoring, for example, they can also consume excessive amounts of energy (the energy costs of cryptocurrency mining via blockchain exceed those of traditional mining of metals like gold and copper, according to a study published in Nature Sustainability in 2018). Fostering dialogue among stakeholders will be key for both identifying and avoiding pitfalls, as will tech hubs, education initiatives, and both public and private investments directed at protecting biodiverse areas. It will only be by maintaining safeguards through effective regulation, innovative monitoring, remote sensing, and citizen science that we will be able to realize the opportunities presented by the Fourth Industrial Revolution - and to respect nature’s limits.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.21"
"4.423","Innovation for Social Benefit","","Examples of social innovation are all around us; they include everything from kindergartens and hospices to more modern innovations like Wikipedia and microfinance (small loans made to entrepreneurs in the developing world without access to traditional bank loans). Social innovation is often defined as innovation that aims to both tackle social problems and upgrade the means used to address those problems. This can take the form of new products, services, initiatives, organizational models, or simply novel approaches to accessing public goods - often achieved by creatively re-combining already-existing elements. The field has developed rapidly in recent years, as new sources of funding, public policies, academic research, and networks are developed in service of it. The everyday work of social innovation typically happens within social enterprises (organizations trying to solve social problems by using practical, market-based approaches), charities, non-governmental organizations, social movements, or patient groups. Universities, large companies, and governments can also play important roles, particularly in terms of validating and scaling-up valuable ideas; past examples of this scaling-up include the expansion of the kindergarten movement to privately-run nurseries, the construction of public playgrounds, and the commercialization of open source software developed by communities). One particularly interesting area of social innovation involves the development of tools used to support digital democracy, or “civic tech,” designed to encourage broader civic engagement - by, for example, promoting political campaigns, working to stop corruption, or helping communities self-organize. Social innovation faces barriers that are different than those standing in the way of other kinds of innovation, however. The lack of immediately-apparent commercial incentives in social innovation typically makes it more difficult to raise the capital needed to support it, for example, and some innovation can threaten existing power structures - which may respond accordingly. In order to cope with such challenges, the people driving social innovation may sometimes deploy “frugal innovation”; closely tied to the Indian concept of “jugaad innovation,” frugal innovation involves doing more with less in order to reach normally-overlooked consumers, or to make scarce public resources stretch further. One example of this is the M-Pesa mobile phone-based payment and microfinancing service, which has been deployed in countries in Africa, Asia, and eastern Europe to enable people to access banking services on an everyday device - without requiring access to an actual bank.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.80"
"4.424","Innovative Manufacturing and Materials","","While the dramatic increase in the use of additive manufacturing, often referred to as 3D printing, has generated new opportunities in many industries, the aerospace sector has been at the forefront of this revolution. 3D printing has given rise to a new, design-centric paradigm, enabling the manufacture of high-performance components with previously un-realizable geometries that consolidate functional features, and significantly reduce both weight and part count in aircraft systems. This increase in design flexibility, coupled with related cost and time-savings, continues to drive the adoption of 3D printing by key aerospace players. The application of 3D printing has meanwhile spurred further research in measurement sciences, in turn challenging existing regulatory frameworks and creating new opportunities for technological disruption at many points along the supply chain.  While most recent progress in manufacturing aerospace components has been focused on metals, 3D printing of long carbon fibre composites has the potential to enable even greater design possibilities - by enabling greater control of the fibre orientation within a part. Though development in this area is still nascent, it is nonetheless an exciting prospect. Another recent trend is the use of non-renewable materials in certain aircraft components, despite growing demand for the extraction and recycling of materials into new components - something that must be aggressively pursued. Functional materials, or materials with distinct properties or functions such as magnetism, have the potential to make aircraft smarter, increasingly resilient, and lighter. Their adoption has been relatively rare, however, and opportunities exist to use them in order to rethink how we design aircraft. They could also enable significant cost-savings for the industry, and potentially cut down on aircraft development time - which is currently one of the key issues affecting the sector. A good example is the ability to incorporate functional materials that are self-healing and can therefore increase aircraft longevity, while reducing downtime required for maintenance.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.5"
"4.425","Institutional Efficiency and Public Finance","","Colombia suffers from relatively poor government efficiency, lacklustre management of public investments, public utilities that fall short, and an inadequate civil service. Despite its relatively healthy GDP per capita, Colombia placed well below other developing countries such as Chile, South Africa, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Turkey in terms of public-sector performance in the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index 2017-2018. This is has direct impact on public faith in the government; the results of a 2017 YanHaas survey in Colombia showed that 70% of respondents did not have a positive opinion of government institutions, and that they believed the country’s Supreme Court of Justice was not doing a good job. In addition, 80% of respondents had a negative opinion of congress. According to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development figures, Colombia collected far less in taxes as a percentage of GDP than the OECD average in 2015. Tax evasion is a significant problem in Colombia, and is estimated to equate to 4% of GDP even when only taking into account income and value-added tax. Due to a decline in oil revenue, the Colombian government has been forced to implement tax increases. A comprehensive tax reform in 2016 increased the value-added tax (VAT) rate, and taxed dividends - while reducing corporate tax rates in a bid to encourage investment. Colombia must look for ways to broaden its base of taxpayers, introduce e-invoicing (in order to combat VAT evasion), and increase inspections and audits of taxpayers. Only by addressing tax evasion will it be possible to progressively increase government revenues in Colombia that can provide fiscal sustainability and support growth.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.35"
"4.426","Institutional Pluralism","","Traditionally, global governance has been centred on interstate diplomacy and formal, intergovernmental organizations - like the United Nations, or the World Bank. But as the interdependence of nations and regions has deepened, an array of sometimes competing institutions has emerged as players in world politics. While the World Trade Organization remains at the centre of the global trade regime, for example, the proliferation of preferential trade agreements since the end of the Cold War has given countries alternative means of securing economic cooperation. Similarly, the rise of liquidity swap lines and other arrangements between central banks has called the International Monetary Fund’s traditional position as the global lender of last resort into question. While state-centric, formal institutions remain critical, companies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and other private actors now often set regulatory standards, arbitrate disputes, and otherwise help govern the global economy. In addition, networks of domestic government officials - mayors, legislators, judges, and regulators - regularly collaborate with their peers across borders, providing a new take on traditional diplomacy. And, states and international organizations often seek to advance their goals not only through diplomacy and treaty-making, but also by orchestrating partnerships between public entities and private businesses in order to pursue shared goals. While these trends are widespread, they are not evenly distributed. In some realms, like decision- and policy-making related to addressing and adapting to the effects of climate change, or related to global health issues, governance has become highly diversified among a broader mix of entities. Other areas, such as traditional security issues, remain firmly within the remits of central governments. The proliferation of institutions that are engaged in global governance has led to the frequent overlap of public and private entities tackling similar issues. Sometimes, this leads to a fragmentation that limits the overall effectiveness of global governance. In other cases, however, it involves the creation of new forms of institutions and more innovative and adaptable global governance - and more effective problem-solving.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.68"
"4.427","Institutions and Alliances","","One consequence of the new, multipolar and multi-conceptual geopolitical era is weakened support for core institutions like the United Nations and the World Trade Organization. Proponents of multilateralism, or the idea that countries can actually work together to achieve shared goals, lament this erosion of a framework designed to enable the world to take on global challenges collectively, and to settle differences peacefully. On the other side of the argument, some critics say the world’s legacy institutions are too closely aligned with a small number of states, and no longer meet the needs of a world of diverging interests and values. Another recent strand of criticism (made notably in the US) suggests that multilateralism runs counter to the domestic interests of even those relatively privileged states that have been at the heart of the multilateral system - including the US. A result of frayed support for multilateralism is the emergence of a more ad-hoc approach to international cooperation; a shift from rules to deals, and from global to regional and bilateral agreements. Institutional competition has also increased, as countries attempt to create alternative centres of gravity, such as the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, or the Russia-centred Eurasian Economic Union. There are arguments to be made in support of more distributed global governance: greater responsiveness to local conditions could better foster resilience, for example. But with institutional fragmentation now taking place alongside a deepening of geopolitical fissures, a narrowed space for global problem-solving is likely to be a source of fragility. Developments in the political and economic arena have been echoed in the security realm, amid a loss of faith in collective security mechanisms. This has been most evident in the form of transatlantic disputes about NATO, a traditional cornerstone of the geopolitical order that took shape following World War II. Although these disputes have centred on NATO members’ relative defence spending, with the US accusing its allies of free-riding at its taxpayers’ expense, the knock-on effects have raised fundamental questions about the status of NATO's mutual defence provisions. This is not an isolated example. As the world’s geopolitical tectonic plates have shifted, it has caused many states to reconsider security strategies, to hedge against possible future abandonment by their traditional allies, and to explore the acquisition of new weapons capabilities.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.65"
"4.428","Institutions and Public Services","","Public sector management in Peru has not kept pace with the country’s recent socio-economic progress. The World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index 2017-2018 ranked Peru 116th out of 137 countries in terms of institutions, due to the impact of corruption scandals and a related decline in public trust. Peru ranked nearly last in terms of trust in local government (only besting Haiti) in the Latin American Public Opinion Project’s (LAPOP) AmericasBarometer 2016-2017. The LAPOP report also noted that a lack of security is perceived as one of the biggest problems for Peruvians; more than 30% of the report’s respondents had been victims of a crime in the previous year.  The availability of education in Peru is above average for Latin America, according to the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). Primary school attendance is roughly consistent across regions, between genders, and regardless of mother tongue or socio-economic status. However, the quality of education throughout the country remains relatively low; the quality of primary education ranked 129th out of 137 economies in the Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index 2017-2018. Less than half of the second graders in Peru reach a satisfactory level in reading comprehension, and only one in four do so in mathematics. In addition, at the secondary school level, young people in rural areas who have indigenous mother tongues (indigenous languages in Peru include Quechua and Aymara), and live in extremely poor households, suffer from lower educational outcomes. According to World Bank Development Indicators for 2017, public spending per primary school pupil in Peru is equal to 13% of GDP per capita, below the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average of 19%. Rates of infant mortality vary widely in different regions of Peru. In metropolitan Lima, it is 12 deaths per 1,000 infants, though it rises to 25 per 1,000 in more rural, forested areas. A growing prevalence of chronic, non-communicable diseases such as cancer, diabetes and hypertension has created a new source of inequality. Health services are oriented around the provision of maternal and child care, and have not yet evolved to adequately address chronic disease, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation’s report Global Burden of Disease 2013. The general quality of health services in the country is low, and hospital waiting times and appointment scheduling delays are long. According to World Bank Development Indicators for 2017, health spending per capita in Peru is $360, lower than the Latin American average of $712. About 3 million Peruvians, or nearly 10% of the population, lack access to safe water, according to a 2018 estimate from the non-profit organization Water.org. Roughly 5 million Peruvians lack access to improved sanitation, according to Water.org, and while sanitation coverage is higher in urban areas than in rural areas, many rapidly growing, so-called peri-urban areas on the outskirts of Peru’s cities face limited access to such services. According to the IDB, improving the effectiveness of public services in Peru will require lower levels of corruption, and increased transparency. Current delays in public investment have only heightened the need for improved public-sector management in the form of cutting red tape, simplifying regulations, introducing e-government tools, and promoting greater public access to information.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.106"
"4.429","Institutions that Work for Africa","","Africa has benefited from improving macroeconomic policy, the increased frequency of peaceful transitions of political power through democratic elections, and greater numbers of active and engaged citizens. Increased foreign direct investment, remittances from workers abroad, and evolving tax systems have also helped. However, greater accountability is necessary to improve governance and tax administration. The challenge of good governance is particularly pressing in resource-rich and fragile states, and the capacity of institutions in most African countries remains weak. Transparency International’s 2018 Corruption Perceptions Index rated sub-Saharan Africa as the worst-performing region in the world, though it also noted that several countries in the area made notable progress; highlights included Rwanda, where President Paul Kagame enforced a strict leadership code, and Cote d’Ivoire, which made strides under President Alassane Ouattara, according to the index. Liberia, meanwhile, declined significantly between 2012 and 2018, according to the index. Decades after decolonization, one of the key lessons learned in Africa is that successful implementation of government programs requires viable institutions, and effective service delivery. Examples of effective public institutions abound. Since 2011, for example, healthcare delivery in Ethiopia has benefited from an organized army of female workers who provide health education, vaccines and other necessities - enabled by a government supervisory structure and information management system, and by empowered policy-makers. Meanwhile deepening democracy in countries like Nigeria has helped begin to build greater confidence in institutions (though problems have been persistently cited regarding excessive bureaucracy in Nigeria, which have only been exacerbated by relatively low oil prices and correspondingly lower government revenue in the oil-rich country). Regional governments are the next frontier for Africa; institutions such as public accounts committees should be strengthened, in order to better ensure that government investment delivers results. The success or failure of efforts to improve the functioning of city governments and regional institutions in Africa will ultimately determine the shape of the continent’s future.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.6"
"4.430","Integrating Migrants","","The effective integration of migrants can lead to economic, social, and security benefits for everyone - not just for migrant communities. There should be a fuller recognition of successful integration policies and programs in some countries (such as traditional immigration countries like Australia, Canada, and the US) - and of the ongoing challenges in other countries (including some European Union members). The Migrant Integration Policy Index, most recently published in 2015 by the Barcelona Centre for International Affairs and the Migration Policy Group, measures policies for integrating migrants in EU member states and other countries including the US, Canada, and Japan. Some key findings of the 2015 index included an average six-percentage-point decline in employment among non-EU citizens in the EU between 2008 and 2014, coupled with a four-percentage-point increase in their risk of poverty or social exclusion over the same period - to a level twice that of EU citizens. Sweden ranked first on the 2015 index, with a score of 78 (a score of 100 indicated the most favourable possible environment for migrants), while the US ranked 9th, the UK was 15th, and Turkey came in last.  There has been greater recognition in recent years of the positive role that local governments can play in attracting and integrating migrants - both those who have moved within their country, as well as internationally. The innovative use of technology, often developed by migrants themselves, has helped to support effective integration services. The German government, for example, has implemented its “Asyl Online” digital platform as a means to more efficiently transfer information among various authorities involved in processing applicants for asylum, including the federal criminal police. Germany provides a good example of the increasingly irregular patterns of large-scale displacement and migration; the country had received about 890,000 asylum seekers in 2015, 280,000 in 2016, and about 187,000 the following year. Irregular waves of migrants have triggered concerns about inadequate integration policies and the risks they pose to both migrants and receiving communities. Inadequate integration can potentially bolster public support for far-right, anti-immigration political efforts, for example, which in turn makes it more difficult to promote a balanced narrative about migration. Other extreme, but nevertheless potential risks include the religious radicalization of second- and third-generation migrants who have been marginalized in host societies due to poor integration efforts.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.98"
"4.431","Intellectual Property","","The electronics market is directly affected by the nuances of the international intellectual property regime; an ability to leverage IP rights for competitive advantage is essential. The World Economic Forum’s 2013 report Intellectual Property Rights in the Global Creative Economy noted that the purpose of IP is to promote progress and innovation, by safeguarding ideas and entrepreneurship. The global IP system should therefore be a tool to facilitate the trading of information and knowledge in innovative, creative goods and services. Intellectual property rights are hotly contested within the electronics industry, where innovation is relentless and even small technological and design advantages can result in large profit margins. Striking the right balance between IP that is open to the public, and IP that is protected for rights holders, is critical if innovation is to flourish. However, the issue has been clouded by companies that have emerged solely to create, purchase, and lease IP, and by discrepancies among countries in terms of their ability and willingness to enforce patent protections. Intellectual property can create new revenue streams, jobs, and economic growth. Traditionally, governments have encouraged the creation of IP by bolstering laws that protect innovation. For example, in Hong Kong SAR the government has solicited information from public companies about how IP is utilized in transactions like mergers; this information can include useful details about the transfer of IP titles and their monetary value, and may help distribute knowledge about IP accounting. Meanwhile Singapore has been working with banks to extend loans to entrepreneurs who use IP as collateral, and in 2014 the government introduced a scheme to guarantee a portion of such loans. Some Singaporean government agencies have also provided test bed facilities to startups. There is still much to be done to advance international collaboration. Governments can work with one another, or with bodies such as the World Intellectual Property Organization, to develop models and best practices. This can help clarify the value of IP assets for investors and government officials. In addition, accounting firms could be better encouraged to nurture related specialists. For those applying for patent protection, delays in receiving a decision can negatively affect future earnings - to help speed the process, higher priority could be given to those patents with the potential to deliver public benefits, such as those related to green technology or medications.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.45"
"4.432","Intelligence Augmentation","","Recent breakthroughs in wearable robotic systems may enable humans to perform physical feats that would have once been impossible, like walking extreme distances or carrying heavy loads. In addition, research is underway that could result in better prosthetic limbs that are equipped with sensors and sophisticated algorithms, and are capable of receiving commands directly from the human nervous system. These technologies could one day mean the end of physical disability - or the enhancement of existing brain functions. In addition to systems that are worn on the body, smart robotics systems have been developed to assist humans in tasks that require dedicated precision and repetition, such as surgery. Meanwhile so-called telepresence robotics enables people to be “present” for meetings or activities via a mobile video screen. Other forms of human enhancement include augmented reality devices that help people perceive their environment with richer relevant information. Google’s Glass eyewear drew attention as one of the first such devices that could be worn in everyday situations, though the technology was widely panned due to privacy issues and aesthetic appeal. Microsoft’s Hololens wearable device can similarly map a user’s environment and display data, though it is seen as bulky and uncomfortable. ﻿These types of devices will generally become suitable for daily use, however. Google and other companies have also developed automatic, real-time translators; once mocked, they can now provide accurate translation at lightning-fast speeds thanks to recent advances in deep learning, which mimics the functions of a human brain to help computers absorb information. When combined with mobile phones or augmented reality devices, these tools could potentially eliminate the need for human translators (there may even be less of a need for people to continue trying to learn foreign languages entirely). Some have envisioned neural implants that directly connect such technology to a human brain in order to aid not only in translation, but also computation and memory. Some prosthetics are already controlled directly by a human nervous system - cameras can be linked to human brains in order to provide visual information to blind people, for example. While artificial intelligence systems will greatly increase our ability to interact with our environment, many jobs will be affected. That includes those that have generally been considered safe from the invasion of robotic workers, like travel guides and news anchors.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.12"
"4.433","Interconnected Risks","","A cluster of interconnected environmental risks, including extreme weather events, climate change, and water crises, have consistently featured among the top-ranked risks in the World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Report. Each risk is tied to other categories; changing weather patterns or water crises can therefore trigger or exacerbate geopolitical and social issues, like domestic or regional conflict and involuntary migration - particularly in politically fragile areas. Likewise, the ineffective management of the oceans, atmosphere, and climate systems can have local as well as global consequences that extend well beyond the environment. While non-environmental risks have typically flared and then subsided as conditions vary, or as the international community mobilizes to manage them, environmental issues consistently remain among the top global risks from year to year - pointing to a systemic problem. Responding effectively has proven to be a challenge. While the Paris Agreement on climate change was ratified by 122 countries as of January 2017, for example, just about six months later the US, one of the world’s biggest sources of carbon dioxide emissions, announced plans to withdraw.   As noted in a 2016 report published by the United Nations Environmental Programme, even if countries deliver on their Paris Agreement commitments, the world will still warm by as much as 3.2°C, far above the targeted level of 2°C. The impacts of this are spreading. According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, an annual average of 25.3 million people were displaced by climate- or weather-related events between 2008 and 2016, and the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters has estimated that 96 million people were affected by natural disasters in 2017. Communities in Alaska, Fiji, and Kiribati have already had to be relocated, or are making plans to do so amid rising sea levels. A 2016 World Bank report suggested that water stress may trigger extreme societal problems in regions such as the Middle East and the Sahel - where water scarcity could affect as much as 6% of GDP by 2050. The same report projected that water availability in cities could decline by as much as two-thirds between 2015 and 2050, as a result of climate change and increased competition within the energy and agriculture sectors.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.48"
"4.434","International Frameworks","","The unanimous adoption by the United Nations Human Rights Council of the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights in 2011 is generally considered a landmark in the regulation of the relationship between business and human rights. However, it remains unclear how the Guiding Principles can be most effectively implemented. On this point, there is divergence across states and in specific industries and companies. On one hand, progress has clearly been made in some states and sectors. On the other, as put in the 2015 Chatham House research paper on Business and Human Rights: Bridging the Governance Gap, there remains a lack of capacity and awareness in some firms, as well as incentives which frustrate the drive to comply. In other words, even if we recognize the normative significance of the Guiding Principles, increased state, private and civil society engagement is needed. Since the adoption of the Guiding Principles, the debate moved forward in a number of ways. Two are worth emphasizing. First, there has been a significant degree of domestic activity in a number of states – both in a hard regulatory sense, and in the incorporation of human rights standards into procurement and tender processes. Notably, more than 30 countries have developed or are in the process of developing National Action Plans on business and human rights. A central point of contestation – and one area in which many argue that the Guiding Principles do not go far enough – concerns whether states have an obligation to regulate the extraterritorial conduct of corporations present within their jurisdiction. For example, the Maastricht Principles on Extraterritorial Obligations of States in the Area of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, issued by a group of international experts in 2011, explicitly endorse the idea that states are required to prevent extraterritorial rights violations. Even if no international law duty on states has crystallized, there appears to be normative development in this direction. At this stage, however, states are generally unwilling to agree that any extraterritorial obligation to regulate the external activities of corporate nationals exists. Second, and more generally, the relationship between self-regulation in the private sector and legally binding measures continues to provoke debate. On one level, of course, there is the temptation to say that complementary approaches are possible. That is certainly the case in a basic sense; it is likely that a mix of hard and soft measures will lead to better results over time, and the practical limitations of hard law should be taken into account. Initiatives including the Kimberley Process, the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, and the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights seem to suggest that soft law initiatives can achieve moderate levels of success. On another level, however, some express concern that the development of self-regulatory regimes may undermine the push for harder processes, even where these are necessary. In undermining those efforts, little is then done to address the lack of accountability of private actors. This contested background informs a central current debate. In 2014, a resolution put forward in the United Nations Human Rights Council by South Africa and Ecuador called for steps to be taken towards the negotiation of an international treaty on business and human rights. As with any treaty, there is the overarching question of political will – which states would be willing to ratify and which obligations will they be willing to undertake. In addition, critics of the treaty path have reiterated their doubt that harder measures necessarily lead to better outcomes, and also wondered whether the variable subject matter is suited to a single treaty. For instance, John Ruggie, the Berthold Beitz Professor in Human Rights and International Affairs at Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government, argued in a 2014 Kennedy School note that the category of business and human rights includes bodies of national and international law which address different problems, deal with different interests, and are underpinned by different institutional arrangements, all of which undermine the feasibility of a treaty. It remains to be seen how the political debate plays out.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.73"
"4.435","International Investment Dynamics","","In 2018, global foreign direct investment flows fell by nearly a fifth compared with the prior year, matching a low reached in the wake of the global financial crisis, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. At the same time, global assets under management had risen sharply to $79.2 trillion by 2017, from $48.2 trillion in 2007, according to the consultancy BCG. Clearly, there is no lack of capital available to fund sustainable development, but rather a shortage of capital that actually manages to flow into profitable projects. This needs to change, as an estimated $2.5 trillion in additional, annual financing is believed necessary in order to achieve the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals adopted in 2015. International investment agreements have come under intense scrutiny of late related to whether or not they have an impact or not on investment flows, and related to the topic of investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) - a mechanism that can give foreign investors the option of pursuing international arbitration instead of taking claims to host-state domestic courts. ISDS has been particularly controversial, and has stirred debate on related issues including its legitimacy, cost, and potential for conflicts of interest. Individual countries are responding to it in different ways, sometimes concluding agreements without ISDS, or with features that limit it. The European Union, for example, is pushing for a multilateral investment court, and Canada and the US are reassessing their own approaches; the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which was designed to replace the former North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), omits ISDS between the US and Canada - while keeping it (in restricted form) between the US and Mexico. Recently, another international investment issue has drawn attention: investment facilitation, which is intended to improve the transparency and predictability of investment measures, and to speed up administrative procedures. In addition to enhancing international cooperation and information sharing, it is important to improve the sustainability impact of international investment so that it genuinely benefits local communities.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.84"
"4.436","Internet Access","","Increasing global access to the internet could help information flow more freely. However, making access more widely available remains a challenge. As of 2017, nearly 80% of the total population of Europe was using the internet, compared with about 68% in the Americas, nearly 44% in Asia & Pacific and Arab States, and about 22% in Africa, according to the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). Those percentages were significantly greater among those between 15 and 24 years of age; about 96% of young people in Europe were online in 2017, 90% in the Americas, 72% in Asia & Pacific, 64% in Arab States, and roughly 40% in Africa, according to the ITU. Socio-economic status remains a significant potential barrier to internet access, according to the ITU. While more than 84% of households in the developed world had internet access in 2017, that figure fell to just under 43% for the developing world - and to less than 15% for so-called least developed countries, according to ITU figures. Barriers to access are also based on gender; the global internet penetration rate for men was nearly 51% in 2017, according to the ITU, and slightly less than 45% for women. The gender gap in terms of internet use actually increased between 2013 and 2017, the ITU said, widening from 11% to nearly 12%. While private companies such as Google and Facebook have made efforts to expand internet access, governments have also played important roles. Both public and private efforts will continue to be vitally important for broadening internet use, and in turn potentially bolstering transparency and facilitating inclusive economic growth.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.85"
"4.437","Investing in Climate Action","","Investments in green transportation, sustainable agriculture, and climate-resilient infrastructure can have a multiplier effect; according to the Business Commission for Sustainable Development, investing $320 billion annually in sustainable business models in developed economies could unlock $2.3 trillion in additional annual investment by 2030. A 2017 report published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found that better integrating economic and climate action could increase average economic output in G20 countries by almost 3% by the year 2050. In addition, the International Finance Corporation has identified nearly $23 trillion in climate-smart investments in emerging markets through 2030. Globally, new investment in clean energy reached $334 billion in 2017; China led the way ($133 billion), followed by the US ($57 billion) and Japan ($23 billion), according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Corporations are signing long-term, large-scale renewable energy contracts that leverage incentives, and local financing is playing a growing role in these deals in developing countries. As of 2018, $10.3 billion had been pledged to the international Green Climate Fund - though that is far short of the $100 billion that had been targeted to be available annually by 2020. Governments can catalyse private investment in climate resilience, by providing incentives and funding innovation. Businesses can reinforce government action in turn, by making climate-smart investments and by supporting the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. According to the New Climate Economy report published in 2018 by the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate, $90 trillion will be spent globally through 2030 on new infrastructure, which exceeds the value of all current infrastructure stock. Developing countries are expected to account for roughly two-thirds of this new infrastructure investment, which can be made sustainable and compatible with climate goals through only modest additional upfront costs. Ultimately, these upfront costs can be more than offset by efficiency gains and fuel savings. The potential rewards are enormous; the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate’s report projects an economic gain of $26 trillion through the year 2030 if investments are made in low-carbon technologies and resilient infrastructure, rather than conducting business as usual. Such investments offer an unprecedented opportunity to leapfrog the wasteful, polluting infrastructure of the past, and accelerate the global transition to efficient, climate-resilient, and low-carbon economies.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.34"
"4.438","Investing in Development","","An estimated $7 trillion a year is thought to be needed in order to adequately invest in infrastructure, clean energy, water, sanitation, and agriculture - and to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, which were adopted in 2015 and designed to guide global development through 2030. Governments alone will not be able to manage this; it will require unprecedented cooperation with the private sector and civil society organizations. The overall development finance system may need to be recalibrated, in order to ensure that institutions like development banks can elicit private sector involvement. Projects must be structured appropriately for early-stage capital investment, and approaches like “blended finance,” or the strategic use of development finance and philanthropic funds to mobilize private capital flows to emerging and frontier markets, must be deployed. Increasingly, perceptions are changing, and the financing of sustainable development is seen less as the sole preserve of governments or charities; it is now accepted as a legitimate, potentially profitable component of mainstream investment strategies. This has been helped by a growing general awareness that the global economic system operates in a closed loop, indelibly linking society and the environment. In addition, the sheer size of the investment opportunity is becoming better understood. An analysis released in 2018 by the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate estimated that bold action on climate change could create a $26 trillion economic boost from now through 2030, on top of what would be generated simply by conducting business as usual. The challenge will be to adequately reconfigure the investment landscape for both the public and private sector, in such a way that ensures sufficient funding.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.123"
"4.439","Investing in India’s Human Capital","","The Indian government’s 2018-19 Economic Survey highlighted a central problem for the economy: a need for greater investment in social infrastructure. While there has been some progress in terms of improving the country’s ""human capital"" (shorthand for a workforce’s skills and abilities), significant shortfalls remain. If they are not addressed, growth will continue to disappoint and it will not be inclusive. Due to the lack of “soft” and “hard” health infrastructure, for example, many people either have no access to health care or cannot afford it. According to National Sample Survey Office data from 2014, about 86% of the rural population and 82% of the urban population was not covered under a health expenditure scheme. This creates a medical poverty trap ensnaring nearly 7% of the country’s total population. Gender is an important component of this healthcare problem. Based on the government’s National Family Health Survey 2015-16, it is apparent that maternal health, education, and economic empowerment are deeply linked - and without the last two, women lack reproductive control. The health problems that result from this impose significant costs on the economy, and shrink the female labour force. In terms of education, India has fared somewhat better. According to the Annual Status of Education Report 2018 published by the non-governmental organization Pratham, the overall enrolment of children aged between six and 14 has been over 96% since 2010, and trends indicate that children are staying in school. However, learning levels show that there is still some distance to go. Nationally, about half of all children can read, and less than a third can do basic arithmetic. These gaps in foundational skills affect learning at later stages, and can degrade the quality of the labour force. The government’s flagship social infrastructure schemes, such as Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and Ayushman Bharat, are important remedial measures. However, broader and deeper social infrastructure reform is needed. With government spending on public healthcare and public education now equal to 7.5% of GDP, India lags behind its peers. A relatively weak state capacity and weak incentive structures for service providers only add to the problem. As a result, the quality of public services is generally poor - which translates into poor human capital outcomes.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.77"
"4.440","Investing in Infrastructure","","The United Arab Emirates punches above its weight when it comes to infrastructure; the country ranked 1st in the Middle East and North Africa region and 15th worldwide in terms of infrastructure in the World Economic Forum’s 2018 Global Competitiveness Index. Cars and trucks are able to reach destinations in the UAE quickly and efficiently, its ports have significant capacity, and air transportation is facilitated by a relatively high number of available seats per week thanks to two highly-rated national carriers: Emirates Airlines, and Etihad Airways. The quality of the country’s infrastructure creates a positive environment for businesses (ranked 1st regionally on this metric and 9th worldwide in the Forum’s index) and facilitates access to jobs; it is not uncommon for individuals living in Dubai to work more than 100 kilometres away in Abu Dhabi, or vice versa. The World Bank, in a report published in spring 2018, described the UAE’s federal government budget and the budgets for individual emirates that year as expansionary; Dubai’s contained a notable uptick in infrastructure spending in preparation for Expo 2020 - a planned, six-month-long world fair expected to draw 25 million visitors and generate more than 275,000 jobs. The UAE’s infrastructure development has also focused on information and communications technology. The country has one of the highest rates of ICT adoption in the world, according to the Forum’s competitiveness index, comparable with that of economies like Sweden and Singapore. The UAE’s ranking for ICT adoption helped to place it among the top 10 economies in the world in terms of “future-readiness,” a measure of ability to adapt to economic and technological disruption, in the Forum’s index. In addition, the country has the highest mobile-broadband subscription penetration rate in the world, at 243%, positioning it at the frontier of 5G - a new generation of mobile communications technology seen as a key enabler of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Etisalat, an Emirati telecoms multinational, has announced more than $800 million in 5G-related infrastructure upgrades for 2018. The challenge for the UAE will be to transform sizeable infrastructure investment and technological readiness into increased innovation capability - on this metric, the country lagged behind most advanced economies in the Forum’s index, by placing 35th.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.128"
"4.441","Investing in People","","The World Economic Forum’s 2018 Global Competitiveness Index ranked the UAE 2nd in the Middle East and North Africa region in terms of the quality of its labour market. However, in terms of the “future-readiness” of its workforce, or the ability of workers to act as forces for change rather than becoming the victims of change, the country ranked below all of its Gulf neighbours - and well below most advanced economies in the index. The Emirati economy is labour-intensive, and relies largely on relatively inexpensive, low-skilled foreign labour. According to UAE government data, nearly 90% of the country’s population, and 99% of its private-sector workforce, are made up of non-citizens. Most Emiratis are drawn to better-paying jobs available in the public sector, or lack the qualifications to take on well-paid, highly-skilled jobs outside of government. According to the Forum’s index, the quality of the UAE’s “human capital” remains a constraint on economic growth. Members of the current workforce have on average less than 10 years of schooling, and the segmentation of the workforce, with little mobility among different areas, adds to the rigidity of the labour market and reduces the utilization of available talent. A key weakness shared by the UAE with the wider region is the participation of women in the workforce; the UAE ranked 117th out of 140 economies in the index, while Qatar ranked 101st and Saudi Arabia placed 131st. In order to create a more future-ready economy, the UAE is attempting to transition to a knowledge- and services-based economy that feeds on innovation rather than natural resources - and which depends less on low-skilled foreign labour. This will require significant investment in higher education and greater efforts to leverage local talent, including women. The Emirate of Dubai has had related measures in place for more than a decade. Meanwhile the Emirate of Abu Dhabi has worked with foreign academic institutions including the Sorbonne and New York University to establish local branches, and the federal government in 2017 rolled out standardized, innovation-oriented curricula for schools across the country. The country’s openness to new approaches to boosting education is illustrated by a law spearheaded by the UAE Ministry of Culture and Knowledge Development in 2016 that mandated free time for employees during work hours in order to enable them to read.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.128"
"4.442","IoT Value Creation and Business Models","","The Internet of Things can improve efficiency and productivity as it connects everyday machines via the web - but it cannot create value out of nothing. It requires significant innovation, greater investment, and broader participation in every industry where it is poised to have an impact. The IoT draws from multiple disciplines in order to build something greater than would be possible through siloed innovation; as a result of its deployment, technology providers can see increased hardware and service sales, marketing firms can grow through improved analytics, and consumers can directly benefit through improved health and wellness monitoring, or by reducing monitored fuel consumption. While there is a continual need to innovate via the IoT, and to capitalize on its power to disrupt, its greatest potential is to create sustainable, shared value. For example, smart thermostat providers can turn a profit through an initial sale and subsequent offering of data analytics, while the homeowner buying the device can reap monthly savings from smart energy management and improved consumption data. Meanwhile so-called conversational commerce conducted with businesses by that homeowner via devices on his or her walls and shelves, can drive retail sales and create ongoing customer relationships. Vehicles that are connected via the Internet of Things can collect data about themselves, help dealerships proactively schedule required maintenance, and improve efficiency while streamlining auto manufacturers’ spare parts supply chains. Governments can meanwhile partner with technology companies to form public-private partnerships to draw capital investment needed to build infrastructure that utilizes the IoT to improve public services. An important part of drawing this investment is an ability to change conventional business models. For example, what was once a one-time sale can become a service models; for proof of this, look no further than to the IoT-fueled transition from selling individual vehicles, to car sharing, to shared mobility services, and eventually towards autonomous mobility services. Subscription-based services can also pair seemingly dissimilar technologies together to create more value both for the companies selling them and for the people buying them - for example, by coupling an internet-enabled smoke detector with a home security webcam. Data analytics is another disruptive business model ingredient stemming from the IoT, where so-called “information exhaust” (the data footprints we leave online by using sites and services) can be turned into insights to develop better products or target ad campaigns. To be sure, though, only a balanced and transparent approach to making use of this data is appropriate.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.86"
"4.443","Italy's Innovation Drive","","Research and development spending as a percentage of GDP in Italy was 1.35% in 2017, according to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development data - below the OECD average of 2.37%. Still, Italy’s figure represents a increase compared with prior decades, when it was as low as 1.09% (2006) and 0.95% (1996). In order to better harness the benefits of entrepreneurship and the promise of digital transformation, Italy must strengthen its innovation capacity, improve the readiness of its workforce, and expand the availability of financing. The government that was appointed in 2018, and which collapsed in August 2019, did not seem to have innovation at the forefront of its political agenda; the word “productivity” did not appear in its so-called “Contract for the Government of Change."" However, there is much work yet to be done - while Italy’s spending on R&D is about 7.6% of the total for the European Union, for example, the country’s number of patents filed concurrently in the EU, Japan, and the US has been noticeably lower, according to OECD data. This may be linked to relatively low spending by private businesses on research and development relative to public spending. About 95% of Italian firms had fewer than 10 employees as of 2015, according to Eurostat data, and small- and medium-sized enterprises accounted for 78.6% of employment and “value added” in the country in 2016 - far higher than the 53.5% in the United Kingdom, for example, or the 63.2% in France, according to a report published by the European Commission. Meanwhile the proportion of workers who are highly skilled and educated has remained relatively low in Italy, according to OECD data. Italy also has one of the lowest adult participation rates in so-called lifelong learning activities, at 25%, compared with the OECD average of 50%. The adoption of more appropriate innovation and education policies is required, in order to increase the country’s ability to embrace new technologies in a socially sustainable way. Again, the erstwhile coalition government that came to power in 2018 seemed to have little regard for this issue prior to its collapse.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.87"
"4.444","Italy’s Banks","","Italy’s post-2015 economic recovery has helped improve balance sheets at the country’s banks. The flow of new, non-performing bank loans is back to pre-financial crisis levels, while the existing stock of non-performing loans has fallen - though individual banks are in various states of health. The completion of several capital increases at local lenders has improved the sector’s profile compared with those in other European countries, though it still suffers from a funding gap; a eurozone liquidity crisis would create severe problems. According to the Bank of Italy, margins at the country’s banks actually increased during early 2018, thanks to higher fees and lower staff costs. The sector’s restructuring is at an early stage, however. Technology developments and new services pose major challenges to traditional players, which need to reinvent their businesses to match leaner cost structures. A series of mergers and acquisitions could restructure the system, but would face obstacles including regional differences and opaque governance. In terms of savings and cooperative banks specifically, past governments have sought to strengthen their capitalization, though related reforms have been incomplete. Soon after the arrival of a populist government in 2018 (which collapsed in August 2019), government bond yields, a measure of the perceived risk for creditors, rose sharply. This threatened to raise the cost of credit for banks and, eventually, for borrowers. According to the Bank of Italy, as of early 2018 Italian banks were continuing to make net redemptions, with the volume of bond issuance declining. Dedicated plans for tackling the interdependence of the country's banks and sovereign bonds are required; the amount of Italian government bonds that these banks hold is excessive, and hinders their flexibility to make more productive loans to firms. However, enacting regulation that sets strict limits on banks’ holdings of domestic sovereign debt could result in bond fire sales, and turbulence in debt markets. Less extreme, more practical solutions could involve simply decreasing the government’s debt load, European-wide regulation that sets capital ratios for banks’ holdings of riskier sovereign debt, introducing nearly risk-free euro securities, and packaging sovereign bonds from various countries within the eurozone.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.87"
"4.445","Job Creation and Entrepreneurship","","The pace of global job creation has been sluggish. In addition, when new jobs are created they are often not of a high quality, or the related process is not inclusive, according to the International Labour Organization’s 2017 World Employment and Social Outlook report. Emerging economies, where an estimated 3.6 million additional people joined the ranks of the unemployed between 2016 and 2017, have been particularly affected. Job creation in these countries will need to keep pace with local demographic dynamics (such as relatively youthful populations, and expanding middle classes), and better attention must be paid to providing safe, quality employment. Young people continue to be disproportionately affected by global unemployment; the unemployment rate for youth is nearly three times higher than it is for the adult population, according to the International Labour Organization's report, while in sub-Saharan Africa alone an estimated 12.4 million young people will enter the labour force during the next four years. In order to ensure that as many young people as possible are able to productively enter the workforce, and keep pace with rapid technological change, existing job creation strategies need to be complemented by new models and approaches. In addition, there should be a greater focus on promoting entrepreneurship - a crucial driving force behind job growth, which will only become more prominent as the Fourth Industrial Revolution proceeds. The 2012 report Why Becoming Large Matters: How Scalable, High-Growth Entrepreneurs Can Help Solve the Jobs Crisis, published by Omidyar Network and Endeavor Insight, estimated that high-growth entrepreneurial firms, on average, create more than 200 jobs as they expand. That is significantly more than traditional small- and medium-sized enterprises. Enabling startups to quickly scale up in size is therefore one of the most important mechanisms for policy-makers and business leaders to focus on, in order to help solve the global job creation crisis. One particular tool that has drawn interest from governments in many regions is the so-called startup accelerator, or a program designed to help early-stage companies develop business plans and funding opportunities, while they receive mentorship and corporate introductions. A report published by the government in the United Kingdom in 2017 found that there were 163 accelerator programs active in the UK alone.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.135"
"4.446","Keeping Populations Healthy","","The surplus of data being generated every day through the use of mobile phones and social media can be used to better track and contain the outbreak of illness and disease. A report published by researchers at Northeastern University in 2017 showed that Twitter posts can be monitored in order to predict the spread of seasonal flu in real time, for example, while mobile phone data has been used to track the contacts of people with Ebola in order to contain its spread in West Africa. While the quality of available data can help decision-makers respond more efficiently, improved communications efforts can help keep people better informed. Officials in the US have struggled in recent years to communicate effectively about health threats, according to a report published in the journal Health Security in 2017; during the 2014 Ebola outbreak, some depictions of the threat posed to the US caused unnecessary public concern, according to the report, which recommended being more explicit about uncertainty, and avoiding the phrase “out of an abundance of caution.”       Increasing life expectancy will lead to a doubling of people in the world who are at least 60 years old by 2050, and then a tripling of that age group fifty years after that, according to the United Nations. This is triggering a number of healthcare-related concerns. The current global healthcare workforce is rarely trained to work with older people to ensure they can increase control over their own health, according to a report published by the World Health Organization in 2016. In addition, there is a lack of sufficiently qualified instructors in gerontology and geriatrics, according to the report, and a general lack of funding for related training. In addition, as people live longer they are being afflicted with a growing number of non-communicable diseases such as cancer and diabetes. In the Americas, the projected home to 200 million older adults by 2020 (compared with about 100 million as of 2006), non-communicable diseases are responsible for seven out of 10 deaths among people aged 70 or older, according to the Pan American Health Organization and the WHO; in the US, more than 90% of older adults have at least one chronic disease. The PAHO and WHO are supporting related efforts to strengthen prevention, increase early detection, and ensure universal access to quality care.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.61"
"4.447","Labour Informality","","Peru’s level of labour informality, or grey market employment that falls outside of government regulation and supervision, is among the highest in the region; 73% of employed Peruvians worked in the grey market in 2017, according to data from the country’s National Institute of Statistics and Informatics. International comparisons suggest that labour informality in Peru is between 10 and 20 percentage points higher than what might be expected for a country with its income levels. In rural areas, about 95% of the economy is informal, and in urban areas the figure is 66.5%, according to a 2015 report from Peru’s Ministry of Production. More than half of the country’s small and medium-sized enterprises operate informally, according to the report. More than one third of the Peruvian labour force is self-employed, according to the Inter-American Development Bank’s (IDB) 2015 report Jobs for Growth, while 70% of the formal work contracts in the country are temporary. Turnover rates are high; about 35% of workers stay in their jobs for less than a year. These figures reflect a misallocation of resources, and a low level of labour market productivity. The IDB’s report also notes that only 28% of the country’s workers contribute to its pension system as a result of labour market distortions, which is significantly lower than the average of 45% among Latin American countries. This situation can be explained by a combination of the relatively high cost of running a formal, regulated business, contrasting labour, tax and social security regimes, and a lack of workers with necessary skills. Dismissal costs, or a company’s costs related to employee protections against being fired or laid off, are equivalent to 13% of the average annual salary in Peru, the highest level in the region, according to IDB data. In addition, the country’s social insurance system creates perverse incentives, and fuels both informality and self-employment.  The types of education and vocational training available in Peru are generally disconnected from the needs of businesses in the country. Nearly half of all Peruvian firms face difficulties when it comes to finding workers with appropriate skills, according to the results of a 2016-2017 survey published by staffing firm ManpowerGroup, compared with a global average of 40%. Peru placed next-to-last among 15 countries ranked in terms of student performance in financial literacy in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) published in 2017.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.106"
"4.448","Labour Market","","Bolivia’s performance in this area of the Index shows the greatest room for improvement in terms of the costs related to terminating a redundant worker, where it has a progress score (ranging from a poor mark of zero to a top mark of one hundred) of 0.00, resulting in a rank of 138th out of 138 countries; in terms of active policy support for low-skilled workers and the unemployed (referred to as ""active labour policies"" in the competitiveness index) where it has a progress score of 13.80 that results in a rank of 134th out of 140 countries; and in terms of the flexibility granted to companies to hire and fire workers where it has a progress score of 20.20 that results in a rank of 139th out of 140 countries. Other indicators reflect a better performance: workers' rights, where it has a progress score of 71.10 that results in a rank of 60th out of 116 countries; in terms of regional mobility for workers (referred to as ""internal labour mobility"" in the competitiveness index) where it has a progress score of 73.40 that results in a rank of 7th out of 140 countries; and in terms of labour taxes paid by companies as a percentage of profits where it has a progress score of 85.00 that results in a rank of 86th out of 140 countries.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","['1.25', '1.53', '1.108']"
"4.449","Labour Market Demographics","","Global demographic shifts are having a tremendous impact on the global economy, and on the ways in which individual countries must develop their respective labour forces. While populations in countries with large, established economies like Germany and Japan are rapidly ageing, for example, developing regions of the world such as the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa have large, burgeoning populations of young people (while more than 21% of Germany’s population was older than 65 as of 2017, according to World Bank data, that figure slipped to just 3% for Ghana, Benin, Cameroon, and the Republic of the Congo). Much of the value in any one economy is produced by its human capital, or the individuals who possess the skills needed to drive economic growth. Yet, these differing population structures in different countries are striking. One constant among countries in terms of population is typically gender; however, while women may form roughly half of any given country’s population, the dividends of female talent are often diluted by the structural challenges that women face when they enter the workforce.  Talent pools, or the skilled population in any one economy, can shrink and expand in tandem with changing demographic structures. Aging economies regularly experience shortages in skilled personnel, for example. Some such economies - for example, Japan - are looking to automation to bridge emerging gaps, while others such as Germany and Italy have considered boosting their populations by encouraging immigration flows (which has in turn aggravated debates about immigration policy, and fuelled the rise of populist political parties). In younger countries, it is critical to ensure that primary and secondary school education systems are well funded, and effective at providing necessary skills for future labour forces. When a country’s working population is poised to remain fairly consistent for the foreseeable future - with no large influx or outflux of talent anticipated - lifelong learning initiatives can ensure a consistent supply of individuals with skills that match labour market demand. Varying labour demographics across economies mean there is no single model for ensuring consistent talent pools; specific, targeted policy interventions and planning are therefore necessary.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.135"
"4.450","Labour Market Participation","","A low rate of labour force participation (the number of people employed or actively looking for work relative to an entire population), triggered by ageing workers, mandatory retirement rules, cultural barriers to women in the workforce, and weak rates of job creation, can undercut a country’s social protection systems. In the US, for example, the participation of men in their prime in the labour force has been in decline for more than a half a century, according to a report published by the Brookings Institution in 2017 (masked in part by the influx of women into the country’s labour force in record numbers, until 1990). This decline has contributed to stagnation in terms of rising (or, not rising) incomes, and has also impacted the tax base - as fewer employees generate payroll taxes, and more people require public assistance. The global labour force participation rate among those 15 years of age or older in the US fell to 61.9% as of 2017, from 65.4% as of 1990, according to data published by the World Bank; that roughly mirrored a global decline, to slightly less than 62% from 65.7% over the same period, according to World Bank data. As of 2017, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, there was a broad range of labour force participation rates around the world, from 58% in Turkey, to 74.2% in Russia, and 88% in Iceland. In the United Kingdom, the labour force participation rate has actually increased in recent years, to 78.5% in 2017 from 76.3% as of 2010, according to OECD data. One potential reason for this is heavy immigration from other European Union member states - which may be impacted by the UK’s plans to leave the EU following the Brexit referendum in 2016. Another cited cause is change to UK employment regulation - which, for example, has made it easier to be a working parent. This is just one example of a recent, broader shift from passive income support (like unemployment benefits) to more creative, proactive approaches. The UK is not alone. Increasing labour market participation has been proven to trigger economic growth, and better integrating older workers in particular is a hot topic in many countries.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.111"
"4.451","Labour and Education Dynamics","","Labour market data indicate that the Italian economy has been on an uneven path to recovery in recent years. The proportion of those who are actively looking for work but are nonetheless unemployed dropped to below 11% by the end of 2017, according to Eurostat, from a peak of 13% in 2014. Still, the overall unemployment rate in Italy remains relatively high, at 9.9% as of July 2019, compared with the 6% registered before the crisis in 2007 (by way of comparison, the rate for Germany as of mid-2019 was 5%, while Spain’s was 13.6%). In the past, Italians (particularly women, and young people from the south), were not known for actively seeking work. In most cases, this was simply because they were discouraged by their odds of finding a job. Yet, this is gradually changing. Since 2014, the fraction of people actively looking for a job has increased, for example, though it remains lower than the eurozone average. Employment data show many of those looking for a job managed to find one; in summer 2017 the number of people working in the country topped 23 million for the first time since 2008. Labour market data in northern regions of Italy are relatively similar to what can be found in the most developed European areas. In the southern Italian regions and the country’s islands, however, unemployment rates as of 2016 ranged between 12% (in Abruzzo) and 23% (in Calabria), according to Eurostat data, or between three and four times higher than those in the north. In 2014, the Italian government adopted a “Jobs Act” that encouraged hiring by temporarily making the government responsible for social security contributions for those firms that hire new, permanent employees. Yet, recent data do not reflect a qualitative shift. According to Istat employment data, the proportion of short-term employees in the overall workforce has actually increased. In 2018, a newly-installed government issued a “Dignity Decree” aimed at discouraging short-term contracts, by making their renewal costlier and more tightly regulated (the issue of whether the decree, which has since been converted into law, will really deliver the intended outcome of making work less precarious has been the subject of heated debate).","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.87"
"4.452","Leadership and Governance","","Saudi Arabia's high-profile legal crackdown on corruption can be viewed as part of a broader commitment to address the problem. The kingdom ushered in a new generation of leadership when King Salman named his then 31-year-old son crown prince in 2017. Now, Mohammed bin Salman is in a position to reshape Saudi Arabia for decades to come. The government’s “Vision 2030” plan calls for the diversification of the country’s oil-dependent economy, and other structural transformation; the crown prince has touted the plan as a means to turn Saudi Arabia into an investment powerhouse that is both transparent and open about its shortcomings, and a hub connecting Asia, Europe, and Africa. According to the World Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicators published in 2017, Saudi Arabia’s best scores were in regard to the “Rule of Law,” “Government Effectiveness,” and “Control of Corruption”; its core weakness, meanwhile, was a low score in terms of “Voice and Accountability.” On that metric, the kingdom scored significantly below the average both for its neighbours, and for non-Organisation for Economic Co-operation Economic and Development (OECD) members that are also high-income countries. In addition to a lack of accountability, challenges facing Saudi Arabia include often-outdated regulations, and lingering corruption. The country will have to work around an entrenched, mid-level bureaucracy that may be resistant to change, and the general population requires clear communication about why the change is happening - and why they are being directly affected as a result. Saudi efforts to modernize the economy have meant the reduction of public subsidies, for example. A plan to cut salaries and benefits for the roughly 60% of Saudis who are government employees had to be reversed in the face of persistent discontent expressed online, according to Saudi Arabia in Transition, a paper published by the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs in 2017. Increased social buy-in could help foster the kingdom’s efforts to remake itself. To that end, the Saudi government is planning a system of financial allowances, in order to help low- and middle-income households better cope with the costs of economic reform programs.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.117"
"4.453","Legal Technology","","The use of technology to deliver the components of legal infrastructure, including regulation, analysis, and adjudication, is growing - and may grow even more rapidly in the future, as regulatory limits on legal technology are relaxed. This technology has the potential to address the lack of access to justice pervading both rich and poor countries, and is already being used to deliver basic legal information. While expensive legal research technologies such as LexisNexis and Westlaw have been in use for decades, the cost of accessing legal information is dropping. Google and other search engines are providing greater access to statutes, regulations, and court decisions, and applications for mobile phones are being developed that provide quick access to both basic legal information, and online visualization tools to bolster the understanding of complex legal rules. Legal technology is progressing to the point where it can provide analysis of legal materials, in order to provide customized advice; artificial intelligence can analyse large, complex bodies of law, and help predict regulatory treatment and the outcomes of adjudication. While more advanced technology is now mostly available only to large corporations, that should change in the near future.  Legal technology is in development that can deliver representation services, such as filing forms or petitions, while so-called “legal bots” are available to help challenge parking tickets, file immigration documents, and lodge complaints against mobile phone providers or credit agencies. These technologies may help reduce corruption in areas such as applications for construction permits and licensing. Other developments include the use of machine learning (computers that self-learn) to review contracts and compliance, and computer-based tools to assess large volumes of documents in connection with litigation. Legal technology tools are likely to gain in sophistication and provide more strategic assistance, and suggest courses of action. Artificial intelligence is already being used by government institutions to decide on bail amounts and sentencing, and to predict criminal behaviour; this is likely to raise questions about algorithmic bias, privacy, data protection, and potential abuse of government power. As economic and social complexity increase, we are likely to see greater need to develop legal technology that is directly engaged in regulation. Ultimately, the role of legal technology may go beyond implementing existing laws and regulations, to devising and executing limits on autonomous agents.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.90"
"4.454","Leveraging Renewable Energy","","Despite nearly two decades of steady economic growth, Africa still suffers from power shortages and a lingering energy dependence on biomass that undermine efforts to reduce poverty. Only an estimated 43% of people in sub-Saharan Africa have access to electricity, according to the World Bank, and there is also a lack of access to clean, non-polluting cooking facilities. About 80% of sub-Saharan Africans rely on biomass (such as charcoal) for household needs including cooking. As a result, about 600,000 people in the region die each year of household air pollution, of which nearly half are children under the age of five. The use of traditional biomass is also a key driver of deforestation, which in turn exacerbates the impacts of climate change. And while hydropower is a major source of energy in a number of African countries, that is being affected by climate change and related drought. According to a report published by the Africa Progress Panel, frequent power cuts resulting from hydropower shortages have reduced revenue at large firms by an estimated 6%, and at smaller entities operating in the prevalent informal, grey economy by as much as 16%. While climate change presents serious health and infrastructure challenges for Africa, high temperatures and steady amounts of sunshine provide the continent with abundant renewable energy resources. These consist of concentrated solar power, photovoltaics, wind energy, geothermal energy, and bioenergy. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, Africa’s total theoretical energy potential from concentrated solar power, photovoltaics and wind energy combined is equal to about 1,590 Petawatt hours (by way of comparison, one Petawatt hour is equal to three times the amount of electricity Mexico consumes in a year, according to the Inter-American Development Bank). Renewable energy systems could reduce the use of biomass, improve productivity, reduce carbon emissions, and improve living standards. Although the prices of these systems have been falling steadily, the initial capital costs remain high - and are a major barrier to entry. However, innovative business models are being deployed to improve affordability. One good example is M-KOPA Solar in Kenya, a company that brings affordable solar energy to off-grid communities using mobile phone technology. African governments can meanwhile boost much-needed private investment in legacy energy systems, by reforming highly-indebted, corrupt, and inefficient state-owned power utilities.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.6"
"4.455","Lifecycle Protection","","Thanks to improvements in health care, nutrition, and combatting disease, life expectancy in most countries is increasing. By 2015, global life expectancy at birth had reached 73 years for women (compared with 69 years as of 2005), and 69 years for men (compared with 65 years as of 2005), according to a United Nations report published in 2017; the sharpest increases were found in Africa. This trend has led to a number of substantial cultural and policy changes, such as increases in designated legal retirement age in some countries. In the United Kingdom, for example, the State Pension age for women is increasing to 65 from 60, and there are plans to further, gradually increase the State Pension age for both men and women through 2028. For insurance companies, this demographic shift has created significant uncertainty about how long insurance customers will live, and the assumptions underpinning actuarial models for mortality are increasingly vulnerable to error - potentially leading to higher pay-out ratios than anticipated. Actuaries have a specific term for this phenomenon: “longevity risk.” In the US, insurers have developed market-based fixes to spread related risk around. For example, a so-called longevity bond can be issued by reinsurers, which pays interest relative to a specific group of people; as the mortality rate of that group increases, payments made by insurers to bondholders decline.   Shifting norms when it comes to the structure of families also have implications for the insurance industry. The growing global population of single and divorced people, for example, has resulted in changing needs for insurance products. The fastest-growing type of household in Europe between 2006 and 2016 was composed of a single person, registering a 3.4 percentage point increase during the period, according to Eurostat data (the share of households with children decreased by more than two percentage points over the same period). A Pew Research Center report published in 2014 estimated that by the time Americans who were then young adults reach their mid-40s to mid-50s, one quarter of them are likely to never have been married. The declining number of people getting married and having kids will result in fewer adult children available as care providers for elderly parents; a research article published in the journal Health Economics in 2015 explored how that may boost demand for long-term care insurance, for example.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.82"
"4.456","Lifelong Learning Pathways","","As career paths are altered by large-scale labour market disruptions, there is an increasing need for lifelong learning - at all ages, both inside and outside of schools. Adult training is vital for ensuring that those already in the workforce, and their employers, are able to navigate the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Adaptive re-skilling, or helping employees gain new skills, will be a key way to alleviate unemployment, unequal access to resources, and inactivity. A dynamic training environment has the potential to provide deeply fulfilling careers to workers and to encourage social cohesion, as noted in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization’s 3rd Global Report on Adult Learning and Education. In nearly every industry, technological and socio-economic changes are limiting the adequacy of employee skill sets. To best facilitate this, education systems need mechanisms to motivate individual engagement with active learning. While nearly 84% of the world’s talent under the age of 25 is being optimized through education, that figure falls to 45% for those over 25, as calculated by the World Economic Forum’s 2017 Global Human Capital Report. Developing countries have made great progress in expanding human capital investment in education for younger generations. However, education systems around the world continue to emphasize the front-loading of learning during an early stage of life, leaving older generations with educational attainment only as a memory from their youth. Skills decline when they are not used, as noted in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Survey of Adult Skills. Understanding the typical lifecycle is key for mapping the points where people will likely have a need to refresh their skills, whether for re-entering the workforce after caring for a family member, or after having taken a career break after an illness. Fostering lifelong learning requires a focus on certification, and qualifications. Related systems should provide a range of appropriate credentials, the possibility to take short- and long-term options to re-train, and opportunities to explore adjacent, in-demand skills. A truly relevant education system cannot be delivered by the public sector or private sector alone; working together, governments, educators and the private sector should be able to develop the infrastructure required to enable learning and training opportunities for workers at all stages of their careers.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.43"
"4.457","Limits of Monetary Policy","","In an attempt to boost economic growth, central banks around the world have turned to unconventional monetary policy to reignite their economic engines. The US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan have all pursued unprecedented levels of quantitative easing in the form of bond buying and bank lending. In most cases the massive intervention and use of unconventional tools was a byproduct of the 2008 global financial crisis and the havoc it wreaked on developed economies. Central banks tried to use traditional methods to spur economic growth, but with interest rates near, or at, zero, and economic growth still not satisfactory, these banks turned to new tools. The unconventional monetary policies pursued by the big developed country central banks have had a fairly significant impact on both the financial markets and real economy of developed countries, and have also affected the financial markets of developing countries who did not directly participate in quantitative easing. According to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs 2013 working paper on The Spillover Effects of Unconventional Monetary Policies in Major Developed Countries on Developing Countries, the impact of changes to long-term yields resulting from quantitative easing mean that the average GDP growth over 5 years would have been 1.88% less in the US, .70% less in Japan, .63% less in the Euro Area and, on average, .77% less in the BRIC (Brazil, China, India, Russian Federation) countries. The programs, however, are beginning to run out of steam, with many, including former central bank heads, believing that further stimulus via central banks will not be as effective, due to already low - and in some cases negative - interest rates and their effects on bank profitability and income for savers, the complexity of easing announcements, and market distortions. Many, including former central bankers, now thing it is time to move more towards fiscal stimulus tools.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.110"
"4.458","Livability and Tourism in Switzerland","","Zurich, Basel and Geneva regularly rank among the best cities in the world to live, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has reported that Switzerland performs above average in terms of providing for well-being, jobs, income, health, environmental quality, and education. Those factors have bolstered Switzerland’s standing as a tourist destination (the country was among the first in Europe to develop a modern tourism industry). Switzerland ranked 10th overall in the World Economic Forum’s Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report 2017, 4th in terms of ground transportation, 6th in tourist service infrastructure, and 11th in air transport infrastructure. A finely-meshed public transportation network enables access even to relatively remote Alpine areas. “Swissness” can be a powerful marketing tool, both for tourism and for products sold both domestically and internationally. An image of pristine Alpine nature and healthy lifestyles has been reinforced by literature and advertising for decades. According to research published in 2016, between 52% and 89% of consumers worldwide were willing to pay a premium for Swiss products. However, Switzerland's tourism business faces challenges. The country dropped four places in the Forum’s 2017 Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report compared with 2015. This was related to poorer performance in terms of natural resources, diminished effectiveness of marketing, and the fact that Switzerland remains a relatively expensive destination; the country ranked last among 136 countries in terms of price competitiveness. In addition, Switzerland has encountered more difficulty in hiring foreign labour compared with previous years, according to the report, though an easing of tourist visa policy could help it regain competitiveness. The country’s more remote mountain regions and resorts are largely overshadowed by a few select destinations, like the Jungfrau region or Zermatt. There has also been an increasing gap between the development of top economic centres like Zurich, Geneva, and Basel, and second or third-tier cities that struggle to maintain competitiveness as places to live and work. Associated gaps in real estate prices, salaries, and educational levels may present a challenge to Switzerland’s system of direct democracy, which relies upon a certain level of homogeneity and mutual understanding. In addition, the concentration of population growth in Switzerland’s biggest cities places pressure on infrastructure in those locations. This threat has been largely mitigated thanks to good public transportation services, quality healthcare and education - and by a system of financial equalization across cantons (the state districts within Switzerland) designed to reduce disparities.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.125"
"4.459","Local Arctic Communities","","At the heart of the changing Arctic is a local population of about 4 million people representing over 40 different ethnic groups and more than a dozen languages. About 10% of the region’s inhabitants are members of indigenous communities, which are present in every Arctic country except for Iceland. Relatively recent and dramatic environmental changes have left no part of local life untouched. The melting sea ice both makes traditional hunting more difficult and transportation on ice roads connecting villages more risky, thereby decreasing food security and increasing isolation. In addition, the thawing permafrost (frozen ground) that rests under much of the region’s infrastructure has made it necessary to rebuild schools and other vital community structures - or, in the worst cases, relocate whole communities with dramatic social and economic consequences. These developments can exacerbate mental health challenges that have long been prominent in the Arctic, and are often related to rapid social change, limited local opportunities, and the historic oppression of indigenous people. The extent to which future development projects share benefits and empower local communities will largely determine whether these local cultures can continue to thrive. Some Arctic communities struggle not only with prevalent mental health issues, but also a lack of resources to provide health care. Initiatives like the Arctic Mental Health Working Group, coordinated by the US Arctic Research Commission, are trying to address these challenges. One example of an unexpected consequence of economic development in the Arctic is a high male-to-female ratio in some regions, mainly due to two trends: an emphasis on traditional male occupations such as fishing and resource extraction, and local women becoming more educated and interested in jobs outside of the area. Due to the expanding footprint of resource extraction in the Arctic, these imbalances may continue. In order to help young people better connect with their communities, share their voices, and provide their perspectives to Arctic decision-makers on trends like these, opportunities have been created including the Arctic Youth Ambassador Program. There is a general need to focus on education and innovation in the region as a corollary to resource development - in order to support sustainable, culturally-thriving, and vibrant Arctic communities.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.10"
"4.460","Logistics Property and Infrastructure","","The online retail boom is spurring new logistics infrastructure development. Prologis, the world’s biggest owner of distribution centres and logistics properties, estimates that for every €1 billion in annual online retail sales, 72,000 square metres of floorspace is required at fulfilment centres. Much of this space is being newly built, and not simply converted from existing warehouses. Online retailers also increasingly require local satellite depots both in and around urban areas, to provide same- or next-day delivery. These facilities are currently in short supply in many cities, raising the possibility of conventional retail space in shopping malls being converted for the logistics of online selling. In response to the surge in e-commerce, Prologis itself agreed in April 2018 to buy logistics property owner DCT Industrial Trust for $8.4 billion. In addition to online retailing, logistics real estate is also being restructured in response to the upgrading of transport infrastructure. More rapid and reliable transport leads to the centralization of inventory in fewer and bigger warehouses, clustered around motorway intersections or in the vicinity of freight terminals. While this process is well advanced in developed countries, in emerging markets it is creating new demand for logistics property in strategic locations. In many cities, a process known as “logistics sprawl” has dispersed logistical activity to the urban periphery, where land values are lower and transport connections are generally superior. Companies are becoming more interested in logistics facilities that combine good road access with rail or waterway connections, and expand their choice of transport mode. Logistics capacity is also likely to migrate away from floodplains and low-lying coastal locations that are exposed to the extreme weather events and sea level rise caused by climate change. In addition, warehouse buildings are being influenced by automation, 3D printing and the wider digitalization of supply chains. Logistics is now considered one of the most lucrative sectors of the commercial property market, thanks to good growth prospects and healthy long-term yields. Governments and municipal authorities that traditionally took a negative view of warehouses now promote them, in recognition of their employment generation and local economic impact. The growth of services in warehouses has meanwhile blurred the traditional distinction between warehousing and manufacturing, enabling logistics firms to compete more effectively for industrial-zoned land. Logistics hubs also play a key role in regional development strategies, often built around the nucleus of a major port or airport.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.122"
"4.461","Logistics Skill Shortages","","Logistics is labour-intensive, and its increasing technical sophistication is creating a need for new skills. A study by the Kühne Logistics University and the World Bank published in 2017 found that in many countries, these skills requirements are not being met. It revealed, for example, that in developing countries the skills shortage was most acute at the managerial level, while in the developed world many businesses struggle to find enough operational staff. The most widely publicized skills shortage relates to truck drivers, in countries including the US, Germany and the United Kingdom. It is estimated that the US will be short of 175,000 drivers by 2026, and Germany short of 150,000 drivers within 10 to 15 years. The problem is not confined to developed countries; truck driver shortages have been reported in South Africa, India and Brazil. The lack of qualified truck drivers is already impairing the quality and efficiency of road freight operations, and the situation is likely to worsen. Roughly 70% of supply chain practitioners in a recent Supply Chain World survey found it to be somewhat or extremely challenging to hire and retain talent. Meanwhile a third of businesses surveyed by Capgemini Consulting and Penn State University had settled into a “low skill equilibrium,” or changed their business models, because of a lack of supply chain talent.   There are numerous reasons for the inability to attract skilled employees: the poor public image of the logistics sector; uncompetitive wages and working conditions; a lack of logistics-related topics in school and university curricula; and inadequate training and apprenticeships. Intense competition and thin profit margins in logistics businesses such as road haulage have limited the ability to increase wages. In addition, efforts to professionalize employment have been counteracted by the so-called gig economy, which has fostered a pool of casual, part-time logistics workers. Labour shortages in the industry could ultimately be alleviated by automation. An Oxford University study estimated that the computerization and automation of 14 logistics occupations over the next 20 years could cut related employment in the UK by 41%. While the automation of trucks is currently being promoted as a means to ease the driver shortage, fully driver-less operation is unlikely for the foreseeable future.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.122"
"4.462","Logistics and Delivery","","The ability to deliver medical supplies via drone has already saved lives throughout East Africa, and is beginning to find a place in urban environments thanks to advances in control and reliability. While intense competition for existing delivery and logistics systems is not imminent, traditional logistics firms, startups and large technology companies are all making significant investments in drone delivery research & development. In order for drone delivery to become economically feasible, however, significant regulatory change is required that allows both for drone flights beyond a visual line of sight, and for multiple aircraft per single human operator. Companies such as Zipline, a San Francisco-based drone startup, have proven their ability to deliver blood products to rural hospitals in Rwanda, according to media reports. An early-stage project in 2017 helped hospitals in that country to cut average blood order and distribution time from eight hours to 45 minutes, decrease the wastage of blood from 6% system-wide to zero, and impact the lives of thousands of patients, including women who may have otherwise died due to hemorrhaging during childbirth. Meanwhile humanitarian organizations including UNICEF are working on drone-enabled medical supply chains in Malawi and Vanuatu. For more consumer-focused drone delivery systems, technology giants and traditional logistics companies are investing heavily in options for customers in the belief that people are willing to pay more for deliveries that can be made in less than 30 minutes. Amazon, DHL, UPS, and Google are all designing and manufacturing their own branded drones to deliver goods to their customers. Urban environments are the next frontier for drone delivery. In September 2017, the startup Matternet launched the first autonomous delivery drone to fly in an urban environment with official approval, in Switzerland. Japan has set an ambitious target for drone delivery within Tokyo by 2020, in time for the Summer Olympics that will be held there. Delivery in urban environments will likely require specialized infrastructure, both for launching drones and receiving packages, due to a lack of the large open areas that most current aerial delivery systems require. Many other unanswered questions remain about expected carbon emissions benefits, the impact on street traffic, and the potential to further exacerbate the existing divide between haves and have-nots.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.42"
"4.463","Long Term Investing","","In 2016 alone, life insurers collected about $2.6 trillion in premiums, according to reinsurer Swiss Re - making the industry one of the biggest wealth managers in the world. All insurers must carefully invest premiums, in order to ensure the companies can match liabilities and pay out on claims when the need arises. Life insurers, in particular, have a natural inclination towards long term investment, as claims are only likely to materialize after lengthy periods of as much as 50 years after a policy is acquired. Historically, insurers matched these liabilities by investing in annuities, or high yield, long term government bonds that pay out relatively well based on factors including interest rates. However, in the years following the financial crisis roughly a decade ago, many central banks have pursued monetary policies that involve low, and sometimes even negative interest rates. That has forced insurers to move into new investments, like high yield corporate bonds (debt raised by companies that involves a relatively high degree of risk), securitized credit (different kinds of loans packaged into a single, tradable instrument), emerging market assets, and infrastructure including the financing of roads, bridges and real estate.    Still, bonds have remained the most popular element of insurance companies’ portfolios, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which said in a report published in 2017 that 33 of the 43 companies it reviewed held more than half of their assets in bonds. And, amid the ongoing global economic recovery, central banks are more likely to shift direction on interest rate policies. According to Swiss Re’s annual review of, and outlook for the insurance industry published in November 2017, moderate global economic growth is expected for 2018, and long term government bond yields are expected to rise modestly as central banks raise policy rates - with a 3.2% rise anticipated in the US, for example. As central banks phase out low-interest-rate strategies, insurance companies will have to carefully manage their existing long term investments, in order to assess whether returning to a greater emphasis on government bonds is a viable option - or, if a mix of a greater variety of investments has become their new normal.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.82"
"4.464","Long-Term Vision, Short-Term Needs","","There is a commonly-held view that investors pursue short-term profit at the expense of long-term value. According to the results of a survey published by the Rock Center for Corporate Governance at Stanford University in 2019, 70% of CEOs and CFOs at S&P 1500 Index companies were facing pressure to maximize short-term returns at the expense of long-term growth. When firms focus on the short term, it often translates into lower investment in the long-term sustainability of a company at the expense of other stakeholders. Management has to be able to both articulate a long-term strategy and deliver sufficient short-term returns in order to ensure support and continued investment. Consistent metrics for measuring the success of long-term strategies are important. Corporate governance can play an important role in this regard by implementing incentives and pay aligned with these long-term metrics. Another means to tilt the balance towards a longer-term approach has been the increased adoption of Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria in corporate strategies and investment decisions - which can draw the attention of shareholders zeroing in on firms with a longer-term, socially-conscious approach. According to a white paper published by the World Economic Forum in 2019, quarterly reporting requirements are not the sole reason for short-termism - though corporate leaders describe them as a “necessary evil.” According to the white paper, these leaders must become better storytellers about their companies, by framing each quarter as a step in a longer-term story. Management and their boards must engage in constant conversation about how the company will grow, and the risks it will take to get there. Leaders of global companies have been signing a World Economic Forum compact for responsive and responsible leadership, committing them to ensure that their boards oversee the definition and implementation of corporate strategies that pursue sustainable long-term value creation, to encourage the periodic review of corporate governance, long-term objectives and strategies at the board level, to promote meaningful engagement between the board, investors, and other stakeholders that builds mutual trust and promotes the highest possible standards of corporate conduct, and to implement policies, practices, and long-term strategies aimed at cultivating sustainable growth for the benefit of all stakeholders.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.36"
"4.465","Long-term Incentives and Mandates","","Institutional investors often have relatively long-term investment goals, put in place in order to adequately fund liabilities, preserve endowments, and provide for future generations. For some of these asset owners, especially pension and retirement funds, these goals reflect the long-term needs of individual plan members - who rely on these institutions to safeguard and augment savings they will rely on down the road. Ensuring that assets are managed in line with these long-term horizons is critical. This presents a challenge, however, as asset owners may have specific objectives tied to return goals and risk tolerance, while asset managers have internal incentives for portfolio managers and business leaders that tend to reward short-term performance - which can lead to excessive risk taking. The relationship between asset owners and managers is therefore often a time-horizon mismatch.  Ideally, there is an alignment of incentives and goals, often over a long period. Institutional investors’ best tool for this is an investment mandate that governs relationships, lays out specific terms, and can serve as a mechanism to align behaviours and objectives. Shaping these mechanisms with provisions oriented to long-term goals can help build stable, lasting investment partnerships and improve long-term performance. Translating long-term objectives into investment mandates can involve re-thinking the key performance indicators used to evaluate asset managers. While a company's quarterly financial performance provides an easy measuring stick, for example, it is unlikely to provide much information about future prospects over the duration of a long-term investment mandate. In designing long-term contracts, institutional investors should address whether or not fees and fee structures reward a long-term focus, to what extent benchmark-relative returns capture a specific strategy’s performance, and whether a contract encourages long-term commitment and protects against overreacting to short-term downturns. The asset manager should be able to commit to the long-term strategy, while maintaining the liquidity needed to meet permissible redemptions - and reporting tools should address long-term priorities. Starting a relationship with a shared, long-term mindset is more likely to lead to a mutually beneficial results for institutional investors and their managers.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.81"
"4.466","Longevity","","The United Nations has reported that the portion of the population over the age of 80 in developed economies increased by 62% between 2000 and 2015. Japan stands out among its ageing peers, as home to the oldest population on the planet; nearly 27% of its population was 65 or older as of 2017, compared with 15% in 1997, according to the World Bank. Projections indicate that the greying trend will only become more dramatic in the future, coupled with a dwindling population - according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, Japan’s total population is expected to decline by as much as 24% between 2010 and 2050, while the portion of those over the age of 65 is expected to increase to 40% by the end of that period. These trends may be more advanced in Japan, but are likely to also impact other developed and developing countries. Japan faces both a challenge and opportunity when it comes to transforming its systems to better adapt to longevity. Innovation in terms of service delivery for ageing consumers, creating barrier-free urban design and mobility, bolstering social security and pension systems, and developing more advanced healthcare delivery are all possible. Thanks to enabling technologies such as the Internet of Things (which is expanding the connectivity of everyday devices) and robotics, Japan could develop into a global hub for longevity.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.88"
"4.467","Low Productivity in Mexico","","Mexico’s rate of labour productivity has been 60% below the average for Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, and 70% below that of the US in particular, according to a 2015 OECD report (the report cited such a broad dispersion of industrial activity across both high- and low-productivity sectors that it has lessened overall productivity, and undermined income equality). The country’s rampant informal, grey economy has persistently weighted on official productivity rates, according to an OECD forecast published in late 2018. The Mexican government created a National Productivity Committee in order to better coordinate policies and increase access to (and the quality of) education, while increasing legitimate, regulated job opportunities and bolstering investment in research & development. According to a 2016 Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) working paper, in order to increase its income per capita Mexico should prioritize productivity policies that zero in on infrastructure, the rule of law, and financing for both private enterprise and public health. While a shift to more legitimate economic activity could drive productivity and growth, more than half of employees and self-employed workers in Mexico remain informally employed, according to an outlook for the country published by the OECD in 2018 (the outlook suggested that Mexico introduce unemployment insurance - which could in turn make formal employment more attractive). According to the OECD, the gap between average OECD member productivity levels and those in Mexico is particularly significant for small- and medium-sized enterprises. In addition to hindering productivity, informality also impedes the broader collection of tax revenue; according to the country’s Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit, total tax revenue in Mexico was equal to 13% of GDP in 2017, compared with the OECD country average of 34.3%. Other factors impeding productivity include unfair or inadequate regulation, and the manipulation of public policy. The OECD has suggested that in addition to introducing unemployment insurance Mexico could improve productivity by increasing the consistency with which regulations are applied, lifting restrictions on foreign investment in sectors like transportation and banking, and easing licensing requirements in the retail trade.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.96"
"4.468","Low Return Environment","","All investors are confronted by the reality - currently and for the foreseeable future - of low returns. For alternative asset managers the biggest challenge ahead will be to prove their skill to their clients, and hunt down the best deals and the highest returns. This low-yield environment is largely a byproduct of the state of the global economy. National economies, already saddled with record levels of debt, are reluctant to continue borrowing at the levels of previous years, and slow growth around the globe has reduced the appetite to create the types of investment opportunities that allow investors to make the high returns of previous years. With investors all looking for sources of superior return, there is a danger of first, un-deployed capital, as investors wait for the right opportunity and second, of a herd mentality, seen in investors rushing to areas showing promise of superior returns in this climate. This has already been exhibited by institutional investors flocking to hedge funds post-2008 and then withdrawing, and most recently the keen interest that investors of all stripes have taken in Silicon Valley start-ups.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.110"
"4.469","Machine Cooperation and Coordination","","There are entire fields of research focused on enabling robots to cooperate. If robots are needed outside of controlled environments like factory floors, for example, they have to be able to quickly adapt to their surroundings in order to work both with other robots and with humans. Visual sensors help the machines to understand complex environments, while artificial intelligence aids their understanding of human gestures, facial expressions and even intentions. One of the forerunners in this area is Baxter, an industrial robot developed in 2011 that can be easily taught new tasks, thanks to natural language processing and synthesis using so-called deep learning, or training computers to learn in a way that is similar to a human brain absorbing information. This variety of robot can be easily communicated with using voice commands, and can be visually taught in a way that is much faster than the traditional method of entering commands into a handheld device. In addition to staffing an assembly line, robots can be useful as companions. Their powerful processors and advanced sensors allow them to recognize faces, understand voice commands, and do some pretty neat tricks. Amazon’s Alexa and Google Home are examples of potentially helpful companion robots, as is Jibo, developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, while Pepper, a humanoid robot from SoftBank, is designed to perceive human emotions. In recent years, robots have begun to compete against each other in soccer games, by autonomously adapting offensive and defensive strategies. One of the greatest advantages that robots have is a capability for high-speed communications. Whereas a typical human can speak 130 to 200 words per minute, which would translate into tens of bytes per second, robots can communicate as fast as one gigabyte (1 billion bytes) per second. Groups of robots can wirelessly work together even when separated by great distances, and can be synchronized by GPS technology with a great degree of accuracy. Extreme computation speed (more than one trillion operations per second) can enable these machines to cooperate regardless of the size of their grouping, or the distance between them, making humans far less competitive when it comes to many jobs. Just as data servers have made some aspects of traditional archives and libraries obsolete, robots - like data servers that can move around and behave autonomously - promise to impact our daily lives beyond anyone’s imagination.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.12"
"4.470","Machine Learning and Predictive Systems","","Machine learning involves creating algorithms that can recognize patterns in large, evolving data sets, and drawing conclusions from past experience by using that data - in order to make machines smarter. When people refer to “artificial intelligence,” they often really mean machine learning. Examples of technologies that make use of it include internet search engines, spam filters, and self-driving cars. Recently, an aspect of machine learning dubbed “deep learning algorithms” has received a lot of attention. That is because advances in computing power and masses of large-scale data, referred to as big data, have led to deep learning-based algorithms that are faster and more accurate than the human eye. In 2015, DeepMind, a UK-based firm that shares a parent company with Google, put the power of such algorithms on display when it pitted its AlphaGo computer program against a top human player of the board game Go. The computer program won. More recently, in 2018, a company called Preferred Networks became the most valuable startup in Japan, as investors including Toyota bet that the company’s deep learning algorithms can eventually be applied to a number of manufacturing uses.  Machine learning is expected to have a profound impact on the job market. Experts predict that both menial and professional jobs will be taken over by computers and robots equipped with learning algorithms. According to a study published by researchers from Carnegie Mellon University and MIT in the journal Science in 2017, evidence suggests that machine learning can do a better job of detecting skin cancer than a dermatologist, for example - though it would do a significantly poorer job of explaining to a patient why a lesion is cancerous or not. The potential advantages of the technology are clear, however: once machines learn they never forget; a learning pattern can be efficiently copied from one machine to another; and, learning can be done in a parallel manner in order to improve and share. For example, if one unit masters the art of driving, that learning pattern can be copied into millions of other cars within a very short time. Cars connected through a network can therefore continuously share experiences to improve overall performance. Humans, on the other hand, take a long time to learn. Their experiences cannot be shared in the same way, and the value of their individual knowledge and experience can perish at death.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.12"
"4.471","Macroeconomic Management","","Following the end of the apartheid era in 1994, prudent fiscal, trade, and monetary policies contributed to a sound investment environment for South Africa. The country achieved moderate to strong economic growth until the 2008 financial crisis, when it experienced its first recession in 17 years. GDP growth slipped to 0.8% in 2018, according to Statistics South Africa, or Stats SA, compared with 2.5% growth as recently as 2013. Part of this slowdown is related to declines in prices for the commodities on which South Africa's economy depends. Other concerns have been related to systemic corruption, and to drought. Meanwhile the Rand has depreciated, as the exchange rate has moved from about R8.50 to the US dollar as of the end of 2012 to more than R14 as of early 2019. The currency depreciation has in turn contributed to a significant debt accumulation. Public debt as a percent of GDP is expected to increase to 53.2% by 2023, according to the National Treasury’s Budget Review for 2018, from 41% in 2012. The country’s macroeconomic situation has significantly influenced investment conditions; foreign direct investment peaked in 2016, and has since taken a downturn. The South African government has struggled to invest in development strategies because of substantial social welfare transfers, and a high wage bill. Together these accounted for around 50% of government spending in 2016, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. This has left relatively little for investment in infrastructure and education. Social transfers have alleviated poverty, though a new national minimum wage may shift related costs to the private sector. A lot of South Africa’s physical infrastructure is managed by state-owned enterprises, which have attracted public criticism for gross mismanagement, swelling debt levels, and vulnerability to corruption. The National Treasury has bailed out the national airline, and the ailing national electricity provider has been cited as a threat to the country’s sovereign credit ratings. According to the Association for Savings and Investment South Africa, achieving inclusive economic growth will require significant additional foreign and domestic private investment. The challenge remains to create an economic and socio-political environment that can better facilitate this.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.119"

"4.473","Macroeconomic Stability in Argentina","","Argentina's economic performance during the first part of the 21st century has been volatile. Between 2003 and 2011, the country’s annual GDP growth averaged 6.4%; since 2012, however, there has been virtually no growth, as periodic improvement has been offset by recession. In addition to persistent inflation and growing macroeconomic imbalances, Argentina’s recent currency crisis and a prolonged drought have only worsened public finances. In 2018, the country, which has one of the largest economies in Latin America, turned to the International Monetary Fund for a $57 billion bailout in order to ease investor concerns about a decline in the value of the peso - and the government’s related ability to make debt payments. In late 2018, the government won approval for austerity measures including severe cuts to spending on public works, which are intended to help jump-start a slumping economy. The Argentine economy is expected to continue to contract in 2019, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, before returning to 2.3% annual growth in 2020. The country’s recovery will be led by exports, as domestic consumer demand will be blunted by tight monetary and fiscal policy, according to the OECD. While tight monetary policy may stifle consumer spending, it is also a key ingredient in the Argentine economy’s stabilization - alongside rapid fiscal consolidation. The government is now committed to eliminating its primary fiscal deficit (which registered at 2.4% of GDP for 2018) in 2019, and to attaining a primary fiscal surplus equal to 1.1% of GDP in 2020. The government is also aiming to maintain a consistent exchange rate policy (the peso remained volatile as of early 2019 and some analysts projected that it would remain so until national elections slated for October). Inflation remains persistently high, and the government announced controversial price controls in early 2019 in order to try to contain it. The October elections represent an “important uncertainty,” according to an IMF report published in April 2019, as they could raise doubts about the government’s ability to achieve its fiscal targets. In order to mitigate these risks, according to the report, government policy plans must be steadfastly executed, and clearly communicated with both financial markets and the general public.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.11"
"4.474","Macroeconomic Vulnerability in Latin America","","Latin America’s economy is expanding but at a slower rate than anticipated, according to a report published by the International Monetary Fund - which noted that GDP growth for the region is expected to be 2% for 2019, and 2.5% the following year (up from 1.1% in 2018). US-China trade tensions, a related tightening of global financial conditions and weakened commodity prices are to blame for the region’s lacklustre outlook, according to the report (growth was also hampered in some countries by tightened monetary policy). In Brazil, which has the region’s biggest economy, annual GDP growth is expected to top 2% in 2019 for the first time in six years thanks to the election of a “market-friendly” administration, though Mexico (the region’s second-biggest economy) has revised growth expectations lower due to uncertainty about its new administration’s policies, according to the IMF report; when excluding Venezuela, which has suffered from political upheaval and hyperinflation, GDP growth for the region as a whole in 2019 would be 2.3% (instead of the anticipated 2%), according to the report. A 2016 Inter-American Development Bank publication, Saving for Development, described national saving as a vehicle through which Latin America could become stable and confident in its own future. However, countries in Latin America and the Caribbean were saving less than 20% of their national incomes - less than in any other region of the world except for sub-Saharan Africa, and far less than the roughly 35% in high-growth countries in East Asia, according to the publication. The reasons for this low savings rate included a lack of trust in financial institutions, and a relatively high cost of doing business with banks, according to the publication; only about 16% of the population in Latin America reported saving through a bank, compared with 50% in advanced economies. In addition, countries in the region suffer from public spending “leakage” that benefits the rich at the expense of the poor, amounts to an average of about 2% of GDP, and is essence public saving that is foregone, according to the publication.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.92"
"4.475","Maintaining Trust","","The legacy of the invasion of Iraq in 2003, coupled with the collapse of the global financial system just a few years after that, may have contributed to an erosion of trust we have yet to recover from. This seems particularly true in developed economies, where, theoretically, governance and institutions are relatively sophisticated. For example, the percentage of Americans who have faith in their federal government’s ability to handle both domestic problems (35%) and international problems (41%) is the lowest it has been in more than two decades, according to a Gallup poll in January 2019. At a very basic level, many people have become disillusioned with the way things operate, and how decisions are made, as former assumptions about fairness, social values, and expectations for the future have disappeared. Specific examples from individual countries tell a downbeat story: according to the 2018 Edelman Trust Barometer, the percentage of the population in the United Kingdom expressing trust in business was 43%; the percentage expressing trust in government was even lower, at 36%. The repercussions of this erosion of trust are significant. An OECD report published in 2017 noted that the loss of trust in leaders can result in wilful public resistance even to measures that may be in the public’s best interest. In Brazil, an erosion of trust in government in recent years has been the backdrop for a swing from the socialist policies of former Presidents Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff to the election of current President Jair Bolsonaro. In the US, following the election of President Donald Trump, the results of a Gallup poll in 2019 showed just 22% of Democrats feeling “extremely” proud to be Americans, down from 45% a decade earlier (in 2018, for the first time in Gallup's 18-year history of asking adults irrespective of their political affiliation how proud they are to be American, less than half had reported being ""extremely proud”). Meanwhile efforts among some elements of the US government to make a case for more aggressive foreign policy targeting Russia, following that country’s alleged interference in the 2016 US presidential election, have been undermined by a broader questioning of US credibility - particularly in light of the inaccurate allegations that the US made regarding weapons of mass destruction in Iraq prior to its invasion of that country in 2003.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.131"
"4.476","Making Urban Areas Inclusive","","By 2050, the United Nations estimates 70% of the global population will live in cities. Cities have long provided an escape from poverty, though as they have grown (there are now 33 “megacities” with at least 10 million inhabitants) they have stirred debate about their role in addressing global issues like climate change and migration. Some local officials have developed related solutions. For example, Rotterdam, the second-biggest city in the Netherlands which mostly sits below sea level, is adapting its infrastructure to live with more water, and bolstering social cohesion with experimental housing and public spaces. Barcelona, Spain has meanwhile established a process to collaborate with hundreds of civic associations to focus on housing, education, and the treatment of immigrants. Confronted by the estimated two billion people expected to migrate to informal settlements by 2030, some officials are responding with innovative ideas. In Iquique, Chile, for example, the government engaged architects to design quality housing for migrants in a local informal settlement that is both built to increase in value over time, and is half-constructed - so that residents can use their own labour and resources to complete their homes in a way that further improves the community. More than 60% of the world’s workers toil in the “informal,” or unregulated economy and lack basic protections. In response, architects commissioned by Durban, South Africa have sought to design safer conditions for the roughly 5,000 informal traders converging daily at a local transportation hub. Providing young people with a quality education regardless of their ability, race, language, religion, gender, or economic status is also a fundamental part of an inclusive urban society. In Pune, India, the Door Step School program has been addressing the transience of many workers’ families by sending out a bus-based classroom to pick up students and provide a mobile (yet stable) setting to learn. Technology innovation can be used to make cities smarter, safer, and more inclusive; accessible Olli, for example, is a self-driving shuttle designed to help people with disabilities and the elderly navigate urban areas with wheelchair ramps, software that can process sign language, and simplified displays for people with memory loss. The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals provide an important reference point for efforts to make urban areas more inclusive, with their call to make cities safe, resilient, sustainable and inclusive by 2030. This key issue was curated in partnership with Cynthia E. Smith, Curator of Socially Responsible Design at Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.76"
"4.477","Making Way for Homegrown Aid","","Local, on-the-ground aid groups should get a far bigger slice of the humanitarian funding pie - as a matter of principle, and as a means to cut costs. While that is already the policy of major donor countries and aid agencies, it has proven difficult to implement. In 2017, IRIN News, the non-profit humanitarian newsroom based in Geneva, found that two thirds of international relief funding (some $14 billion) went to just 12 international organizations. Meanwhile grassroots non-governmental organizations with local knowledge and networks are at the bottom of a sub-granting chain, providing frontline relief but not getting the recognition or financing they deserve. Some claim they feel more like disposable sub-contractors than partners, as international groups hog resources. As a result, grassroots organizations are unable to mature as organizations in their own right, especially as their staff are frequently poached. There is plenty to value in the internationalism of emergency aid, so an equilibrium needs to be reached - because local aid groups that can rapidly operate at scale are not always present during humanitarian situations, and often need greater skills and expertise, and because neutral, external organizations may be more ideal for helping civilians during conflicts. Relief aid should be as local as possible and as international as necessary, according to a World Humanitarian Summit resolution and the Grand Bargain - an alliance of donors and international aid groups. The alliance has set a target to increase funding to local groups to 25% from less than 3% by 2020. Big donors aiming to help must overcome barriers. For example, the European Commission’s humanitarian department is restricted to funding European Union entities, and stringent donor reporting requirements and financial rules present a steep learning curve to smaller NGOs. Also, the donor civil servants who approve grants argue they do not have the capacity to sign up dozens of smaller new partners. As a result, donors are increasing their contributions made through UN-administered pooled funds, which can funnel cash to local NGOs. Some countries find a balance. Indonesia has said it does not need new international relief groups to deploy there, and instead calls in specific aid such as airlift capacity as needed. After the Sulawesi earthquakes and tsunami in 2018, Jakarta’s local NGOs and faith-based groups took the lead, alongside the government and the Indonesian military.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.74"
"4.478","Making the Rules for a Beneficial IoT","","The rapid but relatively uncoordinated evolution of the Internet of Things, a technology that makes our essential machines and devices smarter by connecting them to the web, has led to decentralized systems that lack proper governance. In order for the IoT to realize its potential, these fragmented systems have to find a way to effectively interact with one another. This requires governance that takes stock of the broader context. While the IoT does benefit from a certain level of governance, it is not at a level that can foster sustained growth. There is technical governance in the form of standards, for example, yet over-standardization has led to as many problems as it has tried to solve by spawning infighting and incompatibility. One of the IoT’s biggest opportunities is therefore also one of its biggest challenges: diversity. One, single set of standards must be created that works equally well for dishwashers, autonomous cars, and smartwatches. The obstacles to this are considerable, however; every object, service, or network has its own design considerations, and within any given industry there may be several conflicting standards.    There is therefore a serious need for both corporate and international governance in the world of the Internet of Things. The real challenges are to determine how much governance is too much, and to create the right incentives to bring all interested parties to the table. The IoT requires a significant amount of investment to be of real use, and as a result it is primarily being deployed in relatively wealthy, well-resourced places - even though it is the less well-to-do areas that truly stand to benefit from the efficiency improvement and cost savings the IoT can facilitate. Anyone working to boost the adoption of the technology has to try to ensure that the IoT tide lifts all boats, rather than sending a tidal wave of disparity in the direction of the most vulnerable. Ultimately, the Internet of Things could create societal value that aids progress in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, established in 2015 to guide responsible global development until 2030. Mobility services powered by the IoT can reduce vehicle ownership, fuel consumption, and emissions, for example, while IoT-enabled monitoring of agriculture and supply chains can ensure that the food being produced is not wasted, and gets to the people who need it most.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.86"
"4.479","Mapping the Brain","","Each of our brains contains about 100 billion brain cells that are interconnected by over 150,000 km of cellular wiring to create a network with over 100 trillion interconnections. Knowing what types of cells in the brain are involved in a different mental process and how they are they connected to each other is now an important barrier to understanding all types of brain function. Many forms of mental illness are thought to arise from defects in the way the brain is wired up, but detailed information about brain circuits has long been beyond the reach of scientists, leaving theories about most brain disorders and even normal brain function as purely speculative. Mapping the brain at different levels – from the molecular to cell-to-cell connections within larger networks – will provide a foundation for understanding how the brain functions across a lifespan and the differences between healthy and unhealthy brains. Understanding on this front is advancing rapidly based on new brain mapping technologies. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allows scientists to monitor the activity throughout the human brain while subjects view different stimuli, retrieve different memories, or think about different concepts. These functional maps provide insights on how different parts of the brain contribute to different mental states and how they interact to produce coherent thoughts and actions. Closely related technologies are providing an overall picture of how different brain regions are interconnected in different individuals. Other technologies will make it possible to extract complete wiring diagrams from post-mortem human brains. Methods for imaging brain tissue at high enough resolution to see the vanishingly small connections between brain cells are being automated and greatly speeded-up, making it feasible to visualize all the connections in small volumes of brain tissue. Even so, the amount of data needed to represent an entire human brain at a sufficiently high resolution to see individual connections is almost unimaginable: 1.3 trillion gigabytes – a number approaching the capacity of all the hard disk storage on the planet. Moreover, reconstructing detailed circuits based on those raw data would exercise the world’s supercomputers for years. But a complete brain circuit is not needed. The ability to compare small volumes from healthy and unhealthy brains is likely to provide critical insights into the computations performed by normal brain circuits and how they go awry in various mental illnesses. The number and size of brain circuits that can be reconstructed will grow rapidly in the coming years. As they do so, they will provide scientists with critical new views on the workings of the brain","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.100"
"4.480","Market Divergence","","Demand for vehicle ownership is shifting to emerging markets. In China, for example, there were still only 124 vehicles per 1,000 people in 2015, according to a report in China Daily - compared with 793 vehicles per 1,000 people in the US in the prior year, based on data from IHS Markit. Rising income levels in China and elsewhere have already begun to close that gap. While registrations or sales of new vehicles in the US rose by about 12.5% between 2013 and 2016, according to data from the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufactures, registrations or sales rose by about 27.5% in China over that same period. Chinese firms have been able to increase their domestic market share. Shanghai Automotive now sells more units in China than Mazda, and Dongfeng Motor Corporation is bigger locally than Mitsubishi. However, these domestic players have so far been unable to successfully compete globally, by establishing their brands abroad and meeting relatively strict safety standards in the US and Europe. Increasingly, these standards create a dividing line between emerging and developed economies, alongside contrasting customer requirements and development speeds. While developed economies may have exhausted their sources of volume sales growth, they remain home to most of the research and development underpinning the automotive sector. The financing required for topflight automotive R&D remains at levels that only mature, well-funded manufacturers and suppliers can afford. This dynamic has led to both chronically low profitability for manufacturers in developed markets such as Europe, and the increasing use of mergers and acquisitions to acquire technology developed abroad.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.15"
"4.481","Mass Extinction","","As far as life on land is concerned, we are rapidly approaching what scientists have dubbed the “Sixth Mass Extinction” - as human-caused extinction rates approach levels last experienced during the era that saw the end of many dinosaur lineages. The situation in the oceans is a little brighter, for the moment. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, about 17 ocean animal extinctions have occurred in the last 500 years (during the same period, more than 500 land animal extinctions have occurred due to human activity). A 2016 report in the journal Science projected that rates of extinction in the oceans could increase dramatically, however - particularly as climate change accelerates. Ocean animals that are under threat include Monk Seals (both the Hawaiian monk seal and the Mediterranean monk seal), Blue Whales (which were depleted in the early 1900s), and all six species of sea turtle found in US waters. Without a change to business as usual in ocean management, we could therefore soon initiate an additional Sixth Mass Extinction in the oceans. An industrial revolution is beginning in the oceans, with parallels to the industrial revolutions that have taken place on land. This involves a rapid expansion of marine industries such as ocean farming, marine energy, and marine transport, and a nearly five-fold increase in the amount of ocean area being explored for deep sea mining. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, by May 2018 the International Seabed Authority had issued 29 contracts for the exploration of deep-sea mineral deposits, and more than 1.5 million square kilometres of international seabed (about the size of Mongolia) had been set aside for mineral exploration in the Pacific and Indian oceans and along the mid-Atlantic ridge. Mining in international water is expected to begin in 2025, according to the IUCN. On land, animal extinction rates began accelerating rapidly during the first two industrial revolutions, when there was much less awareness of the link between human health and the environment. Now, the oceans present an opportunity to intelligently move a marine industrial revolution forward without associated spikes in animal extinction that would compromise the oceans’ nourishing resources.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.103"
"4.482","Maximizing Public Capital","","The limited availability of public funds, philanthropic grants, and official development assistance in emerging and frontier markets has restricted the implementation of projects that can transform infrastructure and significantly enhance peoples’ lives. Blended Finance is an increasingly popular mechanism used to unlock necessary funds from the private sector, and finance projects that would not otherwise be deemed commercially viable. The mechanism relies on three principles: leverage, impact, and risk-adjusted returns. It leverages public and philanthropic funds to catalyse private capital, uses capital to fund projects that drive social, environmental and economic outcomes, and adjusts risk-return ratios in order to ensure a viable proposition for commercial investors. A 2015 Blended Finance survey led by the Redesigning Development Finance Initiative, a joint initiative of the World Economic Forum and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, found that public and philanthropic capital that is committed to Blended Finance funds and facilities is able to attract up to 20 times more corresponding, additional capital from private sector sources than would otherwise be possible. Studies by other institutions have identified similar results. An analysis of 67 investment projects that incorporated principles of Blended Finance, conducted by the International Finance Corporation, found that private investment in the transactions exceeded the so-called concessional funds (financing made on relatively generous terms, often by governments) that were also committed by more than a factor of ten. In addition, a 2016 OECD survey identified $81.1 billion in private investment that had been mobilized by official development finance using Blended Finance mechanisms between 2012 and 2015, making use of guarantees, syndicated loans, credit lines, and collective investment vehicles provided by the donor community.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.23"
"4.483","Media Consumer Behaviour","","People in the US are now spending about $2 billion every month on subscription-video services, according to a report published by Deloitte in 2019, and companies ranging from traditional cable TV providers to social networks are scrambling to accommodate them. As media business paradigms change, media and entertainment companies are shifting decisively to direct-to-consumer relationships. This is being driven by ubiquitous internet connectivity, and by shifting consumer habits (a good deal of content is now being digested in abbreviated form on mobile social-networking apps, for example, according to the Deloitte report). Increasing investment in network technology such as 5G has enabled instant access to content, increasingly via smartphone, and often on popular platforms like Facebook (which now reports that more than 90% of its advertising revenue is derived from mobile devices). Greater demand requires greater investment; Netflix alone spent $12 billion on content in 2018, and analysts estimate it will spend $15 billion in 2019. Increased content spending comes as more players enter an “over-the-top” content-streaming market that includes Hulu, Amazon Prime, HBO Now, Disney+ and Apple TV Plus. As a result of this shift in the nature of demand and means of delivery, consumers are increasingly cancelling their TV subscriptions and switching to over-the-top platforms to consume video. In the US, 55% of households now subscribe to paid streaming services, according to the Deloitte report, and almost half of all American consumers were already streaming content daily or weekly by 2017. People everywhere are increasingly embracing a more transient identity, and no longer necessarily consider themselves mere audience members - they no longer want one-size-fits-all experiences decided upon by television networks, media conglomerates or publishing company executives. The growth in demand for tailor-made content means that distributors must constantly vie for attention, shifting the balance of power to users. Many of these users, having cancelled their TV subscriptions and shifted to streaming services, are now finding they have too many subscriptions and related bills to keep track of, according to the Deloitte report (this will likely prompt content providers to “reaggregate” offerings, according to the report). One constant will likely be interest among these users in seeing manifestations and representations of themselves in content - which distributors may be able to produce by leveraging user data.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.94"
"4.484","Media Governance and Policy","","There are currently about 95 million photos and videos published on Instagram, 500 million tweets, and 5 billion YouTube video views on a daily basis. Governing this sheer amount of content is difficult, and only becomes more so as the ease with which anyone can create and share increases. While trending hashtags and live video might enable users to reach a wide audience, they can also spur calls for closer regulation - the live-streaming in 2019 of deadly attacks on mosque worshippers in Christchurch, New Zealand is a case in point. Despite repeated urgent requests for its removal made by the New Zealand government, video of the attacks continued to appear online long after the incident. Live video streaming has also exposed wrongdoing - such as when Philando Castile was shot by a policeman in the US in 2016 as his girlfriend filmed. Facebook is using artificial intelligence tools as well as human moderators to combat the spread of violent content and fake news, and its task (along with the self-monitoring efforts of other online platforms) will be crucial as people increasingly go online for information and entertainment.  Governments have taken varied approaches to regulating content. After bombings in Sri Lanka in April 2019 left nearly 300 people dead in churches and hotels, that country’s government moved swiftly to temporarily ban social media sites and services including Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, Snapchat and Viber - in an effort to curb the spread of inflammatory misinformation. In China, the country’s roughly 1,900 newspapers, 2,600 radio stations and 9,000 magazines are all owned by the government, and operate under the watchful eyes of 2 million people employed as censors. Whether regulation is applied by governments or popular platforms themselves, a respect for free speech is critical. Net neutrality, the principle that any lawful content should be made readily available online without bias or interference from an internet service provider, has become a hotly-debated topic - as governments could theoretically allow service providers to inhibit content presenting controversial viewpoints, while content providers could start paying to enable preferable treatment of their own sites and services. While efforts to restrict net neutrality have gained traction in the US and Canada in recent years, India approved regulations in 2018 that support net neutrality and bar any type of online data restriction.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.94"
"4.485","Media and Emerging Technologies","","Possibly no industry has been more disrupted by technology than media and entertainment - as artificial intelligence, augmented and virtual reality, and blockchain affect the ways we communicate, behave, learn, and work. The digital portion of the global media and entertainment industry’s income is projected to reach nearly 57% by 2022, up from less than 37% in 2013, according to a report published by PwC. While “AR/VR” is transforming gaming by integrating audio and visuals into a player’s surroundings in real time, blockchain is enabling companies to more accurately monitor content assets and measure the impact of digital advertising. Meanwhile AI promises perhaps the most serious industry disruption, with its pattern recognition and predictive analytics algorithms that can enable businesses to guess the future. For example, as users produce increasing amounts of data related both to the content they consume and to the time they spend consuming it, marketers use that data to try to better automatically provide what they might want next; the algorithms deployed by Spotify and Netflix to suggest songs or shows are examples of this. AI is also impacting digital print media, where content increasingly sits behind a paywall, by enabling flexible paywalls alongside tools to evaluate the likelihood that a reader allowed inside a paywall for free will convert to a paid subscriber. Automated content is also increasingly common; The Los Angeles Times, for example, uses a tool called Quakebot to report nearly in real time on earthquakes, while the Associated Press automates the production of short articles about corporate earnings. Voice-enabled digital assistants, like Amazon’s Alexa, are also shaping the industry, as are automated “bots” (as much as 15% of active Twitter accounts are estimated to be bots disguised as real users). Sophisticated algorithms have also given us “deepfakes,” or videos designed to mislead an audience into believing a high-profile person said or did something (a notable example was a faked 2018 video making it seem like former US President Barack Obama was disparaging his successor). Discussion about the ethical implications of these technologies has focused on their impact on jobs and the distribution of inaccurate information, amid calls for a careful balance between regulation and innovation.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.94"
"4.486","Media and the Global Social Good","","The need to foster greater social cohesion has perhaps never been greater - and the extent to which media outlets either choose to play a constructive role in this or not could have lasting consequences, whether it is in the form of damaged public trust, high levels of crime, poor public health, or a general lack of well-being. As once-independent media companies continue to converge under the ownership of a small handful of conglomerates reorganizing in order to better compete (the flurry of media deals kicked off in 2018 included the $71 billion merger of Disney and 21st Century Fox), a decentralization and democratization is occurring - enabling people to more freely create and distribute content to inform or entertain. This content plays an increasingly pivotal role in shaping the social fabric; media outlets are being used to facilitate discussion on societal ills, and social media has the potential to further awaken our collective conscious about inequality when it comes to race, gender, and wealth - and to foster a more active (and healthy) dialogue about mental health issues that could pave the way to increased cultural acceptance and understanding. The impact of media on mental health, however, has been a source of growing concern. An experiment conducted by neuroscientists from the University of Southern California and Southwest University in Chongqing, China, for example, found that Facebook stimulates the same section of the brain activated by gambling and substance abuse. In addition, overuse of social media has been linked to feelings of anxiety, depression, and social isolation. A survey conducted by the United Kingdom-based Royal Society for Public Health found that people between the ages of 14 and 24 in the country believe that Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter make them vulnerable to bullying, exacerbate body-image concerns, and trigger high levels of “FOMO” (“fear of missing out”). Still, social media has had some positive impact on this same demographic’s general awareness of health issues, and its capacity to organize and express itself. The growth of media platforms has also helped create global communities now better able to connect on issues such as rare physical diseases, or divergent belief systems. Governing the distribution of accurate related information will be a challenge, however, as media platforms continue to expand their influence.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.94"
"4.487","Medical Biotechnology","","Medical biotechnology is a rapidly developing means to rejuvenate the elderly and regenerate ageing or diseased organs - a potentially helpful development for the many countries with greying populations (nearly 8.7% of the global population was aged 65 or older by 2017, up from 6.7% in 1997, according to World Bank data). The use of “induced pluripotent” stem cells, which do not have to be derived from human embryos, has shown promise for regenerating an injured heart (while avoiding the ethical issues tied to the use of human embryonic stem cells), for example. Biotechnology tools are also being used for the diagnosis and treatment of human disease in a personalized way. We are currently able to modulate each layer of biology, from genes to proteins and cells. When it comes to the immunological treatment of cancer, the clinical development of protein- or antibody-based therapeutics is advancing, and the range of biological targets is expanding. In addition, genetically modified immune cells are being developed as immuno-oncology drugs, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells and T-cell receptor (TCR)-transduced T cells. Regenerative medicine will be accelerated by gene-editing technology. CRISPR-Cas9, for example, enables the direct modification of genes in the interest of preventing and treating disease - though there are significant ethical issues related to altering the human genome in ways that will be passed from one generation to the next (a Chinese scientist stunned the world in 2018 when it was revealed that he had engineered the world’s first gene-edited babies in a bid to make them resistant to their father’s HIV infection). Tissue engineering has also evolved, thanks to organoid (a miniaturized organ produced in vitro) technology, novel biomaterials, and 3D printing. In general, a more personalized application of medical biotechnology is necessary, to enhance therapeutic efficacy and minimize unwanted side effects. And, the most important personal factor is the genome - in terms of genetic and acquired diseases. Integrating genome information into medical data is an important component of precision medicine, and is being aided by artificial intelligence. Personalized cancer vaccines, and drug tests using surrogates, are also major elements of precision medicine.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.22"
"4.488","Mental Disorders","","Mental disorders come in many forms, including anxiety disorders, developmental disorders, major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and schizophrenia, among many others. Collectively, these disorders are so pervasive that they represent the leading cause of lost workplace productivity. Depression and anxiety disorders alone are thought to lead to more than $1 trillion in lost productivity worldwide each year, according to research from the World Health Organization published in The Lancet Psychiatry in 2016. Moreover, the prevalence of common mental disorders is increasing everywhere. The aforementioned study suggests that a scaling-up of treatment for mental disorders would not only relieve human suffering, but would more than return that investment in improved productivity. Neuroscience research also has an important role to play in improving the prevention of mental disorders. We still have only a partial understanding of how and where psychiatric treatments act in the brain. Major research efforts are underway to understand the mechanistic basis of mental disorders, and to find treatments that might help prevent or reverse them. Studies of closely related individuals have shown that autism, schizophrenia, bipolar and attention deficit disorder are heritable to some degree. Consistent patterns of genes associated with psychiatric disorders can help reveal underlying problems. Molecular and cellular impairments can be investigated by culturing stem cells that carry the risk-causing mutations. Advances in the ability to map the neuronal circuits that serve higher brain functions will also provide important new bases for understanding how mental disease affects the nervous system. Unfortunately, many major pharmaceutical companies are withdrawing from research on psychiatric treatments. As discussed at a workshop organized by the Forum on Neuroscience and Nervous System Disorders of the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine in 2016, this decline in research is driven by a very high failure rate for candidate drugs in clinical trials. Without a clear path to developing profitable drugs, pharmaceutical firms have lost motivation for investing in neuroscience research. Mental disorders remain poorly understood at the molecular, cellular and systems levels, making progress on treatments difficult. Without new research insights, new drugs tend to resemble existing medicines that are cheaper and therefore favoured by insurers.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.100"
"4.489","Mental Health and Machine Learning","","The possibilities presented by machine learning (an application of artificial intelligence where programmes self-learn how to predict patterns using complex data), have multiplied in recent years - not least in terms of brain health research. According to a report published by the World Economic Forum’s Global Agenda Council on Mental Health in 2016, there is a possibility that machine learning could be used to identify signals of disease risk and treatment response, using massive amounts of amassed biological and behavioural data. Machine learning algorithms are also being developed that could use behavioural data to detect at an early stage when patients might deteriorate due to conditions such as bipolar disorder, depression, and psychosis. Other technologies enabled by machine learning include improved speech recognition software that could facilitate new methods of patient interaction, according to the report. However, some are uneasy about the prospect of machine-derived decisions replacing human expertise and judgment. These concerns must be properly addressed, in order to realize true potential of machine learning in the field of mental health. The need for new tools based on artificial intelligence that have the potential to boost mental wellness is particularly pressing in the US, which faces a mental health epidemic, according to an article published in Harvard Business Review in 2018. Nearly one in five adults in the country suffers from a form of mental illness, suicide rates are at an all-time high, and 115 people die every day from opioid abuse, according to the article; at the same time, the country is faced with a critical shortfall of psychiatrists and other mental health specialists (more than 60% of US counties are without a single psychiatrist). While there are concerns about the impersonal nature of digitized mental health services, in some cases these techniques could benefit patients embarrassed to reveal problems to a therapist they have never met before, according to the article, which cites the company Ginger.io, a provider of an app that enables chatting with an “emotional health coach,” as an example of a potentially effective digital solution. A year-long survey found that among Ginger.io users, 72% reported clinically significant improvements in symptoms of depression, according to the article.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.95"
"4.490","Mental Health in the Workplace","","At any point, nearly one in five members of the working-age population in the UK has a mental health problem, according to a report prepared for the UK government by the RAND Corporation in 2014, and more than 40% of sickness benefit claims in the country cite a mental or behavioural disorder as a primary condition. However, a subsequent RAND Corporation report published in 2018 identified a number of potential wellbeing interventions related to mental health in the workplace, based on standards developed by the innovation and social-policy-intervention foundation Nesta (ranging from a “1” for articulating a clear logic, to a “5” for showing evidence of consistent, reliable results). For example, Be Mindful, a four-week online course that involves mindfulness meditation audio and video-led sessions aimed at reducing stress, depression and anxiety (and received a rating of “3”), had been implemented in 17 organizations for about 11,000 people annually, and showed statistically significant beneficial effects. In general, however, the tools and practices in place for occupational mental health, as well as the degree of access to mental health support in the workplace, remain insufficient. In response, in 2017 the World Economic Forum’s Global Agenda Council on Mental Health published a set of seven steps that people can take to foster a healthier workplace. These include exploring ways to modify existing workplace practices in a way that could promote better mental health (keeping in mind that every workplace is unique), taking the time to learn from leaders and employees who have been successful in promoting better mental health in the past, borrowing successful models from other firms (the council provided case studies from companies including Bell Canada and British Telecom Group), making an effort to better understand the opportunities and mental health needs of your colleagues, building the internal and external partnerships needed to provide educational material and training necessary for successful mental health initiatives, and creating a culture where colleagues will not hesitate to ask for help (and will know exactly where to direct their questions).","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.95"
"4.491","Mexico’s Infrastructure Needs","","Like other places in Latin America, Mexico has faced difficulties when it comes to financing public works - and relying on the private sector to bridge the gap has not met the country’s needs. According to the Inter-American Development Bank’s 2016 report Saving for Development, countries in Latin America and the Caribbean need to invest the equivalent of at least 5% of their annual GDP in infrastructure, for a prolonged period, in order to spur economic growth. However, the study noted that infrastructure investment in Mexico averaged just 1.8% of GDP between 2008 and 2013, and that the average for Latin America during that same period was 3.8% of GDP. In terms of the quality of overall infrastructure, Mexico ranked 49th out of 140 countries in the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index for 2018, slipping 13 places compared with the previous year’s report (the country ranked 15th specifically in terms of airport connectivity in the 2018 index, however). The Mexican government has pushed for structural reforms aimed at strengthening the legal framework for public-private partnerships, and for drawing more institutional investors to a pipeline of well-structured, bankable infrastructure projects. The benefits of Mexico’s economic growth have not been widely shared across the country, resulting in economic and social inequality among its 32 states. The benefits of the country’s most successful economic policy direction to date, namely trade openness and the fashioning of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), have mostly been limited to the North and the central corridor - regions that enjoy natural geographic or logistical advantages. New technologies and skilled workers have generally not reached the country’s southern and southeast regions, affecting their ability to compete both nationally and globally. Regional disparities are also evident when it comes to labour productivity, the prevalence of unregulated, “informal” economies, and household income; the North enjoys an income per capita that is 44% higher than in the South, for example, while the poverty rate in the North is just roughly 28% compared with about 80% in the South. Industrial and development policies are required that better share prosperity countrywide, and help close infrastructure gaps that are particularly glaring in southern states.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.96"
"4.492","Mexico’s Systematized Corruption","","Mexico ranked 105th out of 140 countries in terms of the strength of its institutions in the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index 2018 - which cited corruption, organized crime, and homicide rate as particular impediments to doing business in the country. Meanwhile Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index 2018 noted that Mexico was among a few countries in the region with scores that have declined sharply since 2012; basic rights including press freedom have been curtailed, and without a free media to oversee the country’s government the ability to prevent and denounce corruption is limited, according to the report. According to a study published by the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness, as much as 95% of corruption-related crime goes unpunished, and about 14% of average annual household income in the country is used to pay bribes. According to Transparency International’s 2017 Global Corruption Barometer, slightly more than half of all Mexicans have paid a bribe to access public services. Amid growing social unrest related to this situation, in 2016 the General Law on the National Anti-Corruption System was approved, focused on three areas: oversight (or accountability), administrative responsibility, and criminal responsibility. The Mexican government has taken steps in the past to become more open. In 2014, the country became the first in Latin America to chair the Open Government Partnership, which seeks commitments on transparency. Mexico has also launched an official government open-data website, and has promoted open public procurement and a national digital strategy to promote transparency. These moves have demonstrated some political will to tackle unethical behaviour, and restore trust in businesses and institutions. This is important not least because important social services and programs cannot succeed amid widespread corruption and low levels of trust. A 2017 report published by the World Economic Forum’s Partnering Against Corruption Initiative found that trust had decreased among all stakeholders in Mexico, compared with levels enjoyed just five to 10 years earlier. The same report identified a particularly severe lack of trust in the judicial system. For Mexico, combatting corruption is key for improving stability, bolstering economic growth and competitiveness, attracting foreign investment, and increasing both equality and security.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.96"
"4.493","Mexico’s Trade Diversification","","Mexico is a party to 12 different free trade agreements with 46 countries, in addition to numerous other economic and financial arrangements. The country is an active member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), for example, in addition to the Latin American Integration Association (ALADI), the Pacific Alliance, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), and the World Trade Organization. In late 2018, US President Donald Trump, former Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), a replacement for NAFTA, though it must be ratified by all three governments before it can be implemented. The USMCA includes changes for automakers (like new wage requirements) and intellectual property (including increased copyright protections), more provisions aimed at environmental protection, and some digital trade provisions. All told, its various trade deals give Mexico access to more than one billion consumers and nearly 60% of the world’s economic activity. Still, Mexico has struggled to diversify its trade away from the US, the destination for more than 81% of its exports, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography. Mexico ranked 36th out of 140 countries in terms of trade openness in the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index 2018; however, it ranked 65th specifically in terms of trade-weighted average tariff rate. The country’s regulatory environment for foreign investment is relatively favourable, as is the ease with which companies can hire foreign workers (though the cost for companies to comply with export procedures remains high). The country’s infrastructure, particularly in terms of access to ports and airports, rates relatively highly, and there are other hopeful signs; Mexico has been deeply involved in the development of the Pacific Alliance, for example, which is an initiative involving Chile, Colombia and Peru to facilitate increased trade with the Asia-Pacific region. The initiative also promotes a regional system for innovation and entrepreneurship, with support from international organizations such as the Inter-American Development Bank (its goals include having a social impact and alleviating poverty). Still, it is necessary for Mexico to further democratize trade by expanding the number of participants, ideally with a particular emphasis on the small- and medium-sized firms that represent the country’s largest source of employment.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.96"
"4.494","Middle Class and Inequality","","With an estimated 49 million inhabitants as of 2017, Colombia is the third most populous country in Latin America behind Brazil and Mexico. Colombia’s middle class grew to 28% of the population by 2016, from 15% in 2006, according to Family Legacy, a report published by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) in 2017. However, despite recent achievements in poverty alleviation, almost 28% of Colombians still live under the national poverty line, and the country continues to have one of the world’s highest rates of economic inequality. A 2015 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report noted that income for the top 10% of the population was 37 times greater than the income drawn by the bottom 10%, and that Colombia’s severe inequality is being driven by persistently high unemployment, a large informal (unregulated, or grey) economy, and a broad variation of wage levels within the formal economy. The recent expansion of the country’s middle class is partially explained by an increase in formal employment, due to fiscal and labour market reforms. These reforms have also pushed unemployment in the country to historic lows. The middle class expansion is also due to strong recent economic growth in Colombia, which the IDB estimated was responsible for more than 90% of the reduction of extreme poverty that occurred between 2002 and 2013. Targeted government loans and social programs have also played a role in the positive trend, which could be furthered by boosting the redistributive impact of the country’s tax system, and by implementing more targeted social spending. The prevalence of the informal economy in Colombia hinders poverty reduction efforts, and the growth of the country’s middle class. According to the results of a 2016 survey conducted by Colombia’s National Administrative Department of Statistics, only 38% of all workers were accounted for in the regulated, formal economy at that time, while around 42% were self-employed (a category that includes a significant amount of informal work). According to research published by the IDB, rampant informality in the country is caused by the relatively high cost of official labour, a skills gap due to weaknesses in the job training system, and an ability to frequently rotate between formal and informal work. Informality curbs contributions to Colombia’s pension system, and may also pressure employer-funded retirement schemes by deepening tax distortions. Pension reform is necessary; the system in Colombia has problems with adequacy and coverage, and it runs a deficit equivalent to about 3.5% of GDP annually. Contributory pensions, where employees contribute funding to a scheme, only cover 32% of Colombian workers, a lower level than in other Latin American countries. About 92% percent of pension subsidies in the country benefit just the top 40% of Colombia’s earners, due to issues with fragmentation and administrative costs. Based on the current system, by 2050 a lack of retirement savings in Colombia could affect between 50% and 80% of people older than 65.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.35"
"4.495","Middle-Class Advantage","","By the year 2030, China and India will account for 40% of global middle-class consumption, while Europe and North America will only represent 30%, according to an estimate published by the Brookings Institution in 2017. The multinational companies based in these increasingly wealthy regions may be able to use them as fuel, to expand their global presence. The shift in middle-class consumption will have other, far-reaching effects; the rules of global competition, in particular those that have to do with product standards, may change. The packaging of all smartphones, for example, displays two very important acronyms: FCC and CE. These are stamps of approval from regulators in the two largest markets in the world: the US and the European Union, respectively. If companies do not meet the product standards set by these two entities, they cannot sell products in their markets. By the year 2030, China, and perhaps India, are likely to issue their own product standards. Companies around the world will then have no option but to comply with these standards, if they wish to sell their wares in what will by then be the largest consumer markets in the world. Similarly, while rules for global banks are now under the influence of Europe and the US, by 2030 China and India may have their own standards in place. In the future, no company will be able to be a global number one or two in its industry unless it is number one or two in China and India. The problem for American and European companies is that while their markets have historically been relatively open to foreign competition, those in Asia are not. Emerging multinationals from China and India will therefore enjoy an advantage as they expand internationally. It is important to note that by 2040, the Indian middle-class consumer market will likely overtake China’s in terms of size - based on data published by the United Nations. India is poised to have a much younger population than China, for example, and people still in their thirties and forties are the main purchasers of homes, automobiles and other durable consumer goods. Meanwhile the Indian economy is growing fast, largely driven by domestic consumption, while the Chinese economy continues to grow through exports and investment. Established and emerging multinationals alike would therefore be wise to focus their efforts on the Indian market.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.46"
"4.496","Migrant Rights","","The odds for migrants are not good; more than 6,000 deaths and disappearances related to migration were recorded during 2017 alone, according to the International Organization for Migration’s Missing Migrants Project, and nearly 26,000 related fatalities have been recorded since 2014 (the IOM notes this is likely a fraction of the total number of deaths, as most go unrecorded). Migrants also face an inordinate risk that their basic human rights will be violated; those traveling along the so-called “Western Mediterranean” route leading from Morocco and Algeria to Spain, for example, have been the victims of human rights violations including physical abuse, trafficking, and forced labour, according to the International Organization for Migration’s World Migration Report 2018. In addition, migrant workers in South-East Asia in the fishing, agriculture and construction industries have faced the threat of forced labour, according to the report. People migrating for safety and protection reasons are especially vulnerable. In South Sudan, for example, many migrants have been targeted for human rights abuses based on their ethnicity or presumed political allegiances, according to a report published by the UN Refugee Agency in 2017. There is a strong focus on migrants’ rights in the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, which was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2016. The declaration provides a basis for the so-called global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, which is expected to be adopted by UN member states in September 2018 and is designed to establish a framework for cooperation on migrants and human mobility. The work of governments to address migrant rights has been complicated by the proliferation of non-state actors, however. In addition, real and perceived increases in irregular migration are further diminishing migrants’ rights, while some states have not met their obligations to fully respect the fundamental human rights of migrants at all times. In 2017, for example, the UN Committee on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers heard statements from non-governmental organizations from Indonesia about their concerns regarding the government of that country’s failure to protect Indonesian female domestic workers from abuse and exploitation in destination countries. The committee also heard statements from civil society representatives from Mexico, who described institutions in that country as being very weak - leading to serious human rights abuses, including the criminalization and prosecution of migrants, and their restricted access to health care.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.98"
"4.497","Migration Flows","","The number of Venezuelans migrating abroad rose from roughly 437,000 in 2005 to 1.6 million by 2017 - when more than half of the Venezuelan population living outside of the country was scattered throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, according to data published by the International Organization for Migration. Colombia, the primary destination for Venezuelans in South America and a key transit point to other locations, was home to about 600,000 Venezuelans as of 2017, and 870,000 by mid-2018, according to the IOM. By late 2018, as political conditions in the country worsened and hyperinflation persisted, roughly 2.6 million Venezuelans were living abroad, including 2 million within Latin America and the Caribbean, according to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), which noted that Venezuelan children were among the 430,000 in Colombia, Brazil, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, Ecuador, Peru, and Panama who were in need of assistance. Although migration flows have a long history in Latin America and the Caribbean, the current acceleration poses a major development challenge to the region. Communities in many countries have sought to respond to this humanitarian crisis with solidarity and compassion. Latin American countries receiving migrants are faced with a corresponding demand for development investment that can help improve social services. Particular attention needs to be paid to better coordinating border management, developing adequate migration registration and documentation (including recognizing educational and professional accreditation), improved security, expanded access to basic services such as clean water and sanitation, health care, education, and employment services - as these migrants are likely to be away from their country of origin for a long time. Some countries have sought to adapt their laws to better accommodate the displaced. Colombia, for example, created a “Special Permit of Permanence” which can be used by Venezuelans to access the Colombian health system, according to the IOM; during the first half of 2018, Venezuelans used the system for help with nearly 48,000 emergencies, and to receive more than 150,000 doses of vaccines.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.92"

"4.499","Mobilizing for Impact","","The emergence of the 24-hour news cycle, the predominance of social media, abbreviated political cycles, an overwhelming focus on quarterly corporate financial reporting, and the increasingly ephemeral nature of employment have only increased our tendency to rely on short-term thinking. This has created real challenges when it comes to helping people personally connect to the long-term targets enshrined in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals - which were adopted in 2015, in order to help guide global development until 2030. The issue of plastic in the oceans illustrates the power of raising greater public awareness of the goals, and encouraging leaders to take action on them. After the World Economic Forum and the Ellen McArthur Foundation released an analysis in 2016 showing that there may be more plastic than fish (by weight) in the oceans by 2050, numerous efforts to raise public awareness of the issue were undertaken by media outlets, documentary filmmakers, and civil society organizations. Amid this growing awareness, leaders were able to do things that may have previously been politically or financially unpopular. More than 60 countries have now banned or introduced fees on single-use plastics, and companies are working on more systemic solutions. In order to effectively mobilize action at a pace sufficient to deliver on all of the Sustainable Development Goals (which include lofty targets like eliminating poverty, in addition to preventing marine pollution), they must become strategic priorities for companies and governments once awareness of pressing issues has been raised. The Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosure, initiated by the G20, demonstrates the value of bringing together diverse stakeholders to build understanding; it has convened financial experts, standards bodies, insurers, and climate scientists to develop recommendations for ensuring that the financial risk posed by climate change will become better understood by governments, companies, and investors. More than 500 companies have now agreed to adopt the recommendations of the taskforce.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.123"
"4.500","Modern Discovery and Design","","Our ability to visualize matter in extreme detail, down to the atomic level, has improved dramatically in recent years. Just within the last decade, advances in imaging techniques have enabled researchers to observe materials’ behaviour, yielding great gains in the understanding and improvement of functional parameters. For example, high-resolution, real-time tomography (presenting a cross-section of an object) can yield a 3D view of a device’s architecture, and show how it changes relative to its environment. Progress in widening the experimental conditions required for the observation of materials is also being made in more traditionally stringent techniques, such as high-resolution electron microscopy (both scanning electron microscopy, ""SEM,"" and transmission electron microscopy, ""TEM"") or X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (""XPS""), which are the workhorses of materials characterization. Similarly, advances in computing power and data visualization are impacting the design phase of materials-based applications, via more accurate computer simulations and approximations. Distributed manufacturing, where production is dispersed well beyond a centralized factory, will create new patterns of demand for new raw materials, specifically for use in increasingly prevalent 3D printing. It may also enable greater data gathering, and the more efficient harnessing of creativity and capabilities throughout the world (in a way similar to the Materials Genome initiative, which is a public, multi-agency effort underway in the US to assist in more quickly developing and deploying advanced materials). The continuous optimization of characterization techniques may result in a greater understanding of materials problems, and also in shorter feedback loops (where output from one process is used as input for another), thereby reducing the time needed to address these problems. The approach that has evolved as we transition from milli- to micro-, and then to nano-scale, is now entering a period of multi-scale design, where properties at many different levels are increasingly well understood.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.4"
"4.501","Modern Mining Workforces","","Constantly evolving technologies and business models will require mining company employees to develop new skills. Mining companies in general will have to help frontline employees become “protean” workers who embrace self-directed careers and developing new abilities, according to a report published by Deloitte in 2017; management will have to prepare employees for work that is not repetitive, but instead involves more complex tasks like remotely operating machinery, or monitoring efficiency metrics. In addition, as it seeks to attract top talent to drive digitalization and automation initiatives, the mining sector will have to increasingly compete with fast-growing technology firms. Entire fleets of self-driving trucks can already be operated remotely by a single person, and further technology-aided efficiency is on the horizon, according to a report published by the International Institute for Sustainable Development and the Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment in 2016. Governments and companies will have to work together to help workers who can no longer find their place in a more automated mining sector, by providing retraining programs. The speed at which mining companies are able to roll out new technologies at their mine sites will be closely linked to the willingness of local governments and labour unions to accept the fact that these technologies may lead to reduced employment and procurement opportunities. Local policy-makers and unions must therefore be included in the decision-making on transitioning to new technologies and strategies, and should develop policies that support workers who are negatively affected. Many regulatory frameworks will also have to be adapted in order to better encourage the private sector to implement only those innovative models that provide for social wellbeing - and impose penalties on those that unleash negative consequences. In addition, contracts will have to be adapted in order to reflect mining's new, technology-focused value proposition. Governments themselves will also need technical assistance, as they seek to maintain political and legal stability in mining areas.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.99"
"4.502","Modernizing Latin American Institutions","","Corruption and the lack of transparency in Latin America reflect weaknesses in judicial, legislative, and executive branches of government throughout the region. Recent scandals have eroded confidence in government institutions, and threaten the region’s economic well-being and political stability. In three of its four largest economies, Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico, corruption ranks among the top three most problematic factors for doing business in the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index published in 2017; the subsequent Competitiveness Index published in 2018 ranked the three countries in the bottom half of all 140 assessed in terms of incidence of corruption. The Expert Advisory Group on Anti-Corruption, Transparency and Integrity in Latin America and the Caribbean, convened by the Inter-American Development Bank, reported in 2018 that the region’s average scores for nearly all “Worldwide Governance Indicators” were below the global median; it had particularly poor ratings in the implementation of the rule of law, personal security, and common crime. Transparency International, in its Corruption Perceptions Index published in 2018, noted strides that had been made by Latin America in recent years - though Transparency nonetheless scored the region relatively poorly in the index, and suggested that the lack of overarching policies that address historic and structural causes of corruption there has been problematic. Latin America appears to be falling further behind its peers in terms of controlling corruption. In general, trust in public institutions is at a low in the region; according to an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development report published in 2018, this lack of trust has only deepened further since the global financial crisis roughly a decade ago, with about 75% of the Latin American population indicating little or no trust in government. This comes despite long periods of economic and social progress in the region that resulted in a sustained reduction of inequality and poverty, according to the OECD report - and has prompted added pressure from civil society organizations and the private sector to modernize public institutions.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.92"
"4.503","Modernizing the Workforce","","France has been dealing with structural unemployment for more than three decades, as the unemployment rate has consistently registered above 7%. Its unemployment rate was 9.3% as of August 2018 according to Eurostat, more than twice that of Germany and well above the European Union average of 6.8%. Meanwhile France’s ranking in the OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) dropped to 26th by of 2015, from 14th in 2000. Students’ socio-economic status has a greater effect on their academic performance in France than in any other OECD country. Addressing weaknesses in the French education system, not least by minimizing the negative effects of social circumstances, is critical (related reforms should focus on early childhood). As students graduate and join the workforce, they encounter a complex labour code that creates France’s so-called insider-outsider system - where employees with open-ended job contracts enjoy a high degree of job security, while others struggle from one fixed-term contract to another. More than eight jobs in 10 that are created in France every year are attached to less attractive, fixed-term contracts, according to the country’s Directorate of Research, Studies and Statistics Coordination (DARES). The French government has sought to overhaul and simplify the labour code by capping pay-outs for unfair dismissal, granting small- and medium-sized firms more flexibility to hire and fire, and allowing firms with fewer than 20 employees to negotiate directly with their staff and local unions - bypassing national, sector-level union officials. A significant challenge for France is its need to help workers adjust to the shifting demands of the economy throughout their careers. The emergence of new skills and jobs as a result of the Fourth Industrial Revolution will affect the French labour market and its education system. According to the World Economic Forum’s 2017 paper Accelerating Workforce Reskilling for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, in order to address the potential disconnect between its education system and the modern workplace, France needs to reform curricula in order to better prepare workers for jobs in an innovation-driven economy. This will involve reviewing core linguistic, mathematical, and technological literacies, and working to ensure the mastery of information and communications technology. As an ageing country, France should also consider investing in the re-skilling of older workers, and help these workers understand the benefits of participating in related training opportunities.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.56"
"4.504","Molding New Talent","","Emerging multinationals may be able to successfully ride the waves of change upending global education and knowledge systems. Many come from countries with relatively young populations, and nascent systems of vocational and higher education. Evidence presented in the 2013 book Emerging-Markets Rule shows that emerging multinationals therefore have an opportunity to actively shape the way in which vocational schools and universities in their home countries grow, by engaging them in conversations about the evolving skills that companies require. For example, in India and in China, companies are making significant investments in new educational institutions, and are frequently partnering with existing institutions, in an attempt to better meet talent needs. China enacted a law in 2017 that enables universities to establish themselves as for-profits, and is intended to address the need for more relevant skills training. Companies, and governments, are realizing that the single biggest bottleneck in the global economy involves talent. While unemployment and underemployment remain high in several parts of the world, especially among the young, companies and governments consistently report that they cannot find enough people with the skills they need. However, schools generally, and universities particularly, are institutions that change very slowly - and require years of planning and implementation in order to boost innovation and investment. Governance of education systems is the subject of heated debates, in virtually every country in the world, about the correct balance of influence among the public, private, and non-profit sectors. These debates tend to be dogmatic, and to centre on the issue of whether access to a quality education is a right or a privilege. A better way to approach the problem might be to think about education as an essential tool for developing a society that is politically, socially, and economically prepared to deal with the challenges ahead. Technology adoption has been a slow process in education systems generally. However, adequately matching demand to supply is how a market economy can best function, and given the long-term investments now required of education systems in order to start producing more qualified job candidates, their greater use of innovative technology could provide crucial assistance.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.46"
"4.505","More Sustainable Mobility","","In 2015, the “Dieselgate” scandal revealed that diesel vehicles were producing as much as 40 times more pollution than had been detected during testing, due to widespread cheating. Four years later, despite changes made to systems for measuring emissions and the recall of more than 10 million vehicles, the positive impact in the European Union has been minimal, according to a report published by the European Court of Auditors in 2019. It may take many years to improve city air quality in the EU, according to the report, given the large number of highly-polluting cars that remain on the roads. In the US, the number of vehicle miles driven has been increasing dramatically, from about 1.5 trillion in 1980 to 3.2 trillion by 2017, according to the US Department of Transportation. While the advent of ride-sharing services like Uber has encouraged people to drive less, those services may be less beneficial for the environment than anticipated; a study published by the San Francisco County Transportation Authority in 2018 found that ride-sharing services accounted for about half of the increase in local traffic congestion between 2010 and 2016. Companies are continually working to find new ways to improve the sustainability of cars, ships and aircraft. The 3D printing of relatively lightweight parts has played a related role in the aerospace industry, for example. Global governance can also play a constructive role; the International Air Transport Association’s annual general meeting in 2019 approved a resolution calling on governments to fully implement a carbon offsetting and reduction scheme designed to cap net carbon dioxide emissions from international aviation as of 2020 (which had been agreed through the UN’s International Civil Aviation Organization). In addition, growing consumer awareness can be a factor. In Sweden, for example, “flygskam,” or “flight shame” has become a means of socially engineering people away from emissions-heavy air travel, while “tagskryt,” or “train bragging” has emerged as a local corollary. However, measures to combat climate change by adopting more sustainable mobility practices still fall short of what is necessary. To call further attention to the need to travel smarter, climate activist Greta Thunberg journeyed from England to the UN Climate Action Summit in New York in summer 2019 via a carbon-free sailboat.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.62"
"4.506","Multi-Stakeholder Collaboration","","Collaboration, co-creation, and co-production will become more permanent fixtures of government operations and service delivery. The Open Government Partnership, launched in 2011, already convenes public sector reformers and civil society leaders to try to make government more inclusive and accountable. The partnership now includes nearly 80 countries and 20 sub-national governments. Meanwhile the US, Australia, and Singapore have all recently experimented with more consultative and deliberative policy-making, including through citizen juries (representative samples of people tasked with considering particular community issues) and deliberative polling (asking people to deliberate on potential policy moves), in order to feed a wider range of perspectives into policy decisions and implementation. Care must be exercised in picking and choosing where to collaborate, and there is already an extensive track record to examine; nearly 2,000 public-private partnerships worth about €336 million were developed in the European Union between 1990 and 2016, according a 2018 European Court of Auditors report. Unfortunately, the potential benefits of many of these infrastructure-related partnerships in the EU often failed to materialize. As multi-stakeholder approaches will become increasingly necessary, leaders in every sector will need to learn how to operate more effectively across complex networks, and build trust with one another in the process. That is because the daunting challenges facing humanity cannot be solved by any single sector alone; governance must become a multi-stakeholder endeavour. As governments and policy-makers increasingly scramble to react and respond to technological innovation, it creates new opportunities for the private sector, civil society groups, community groups, the media, and academia to work alongside public officials and provide expertise on technologies they themselves have developed, including on their applications potential consequences. In the case of truly cutting-edge technologies where expertise is particularly thin, non-governmental actors will be particularly important partners helping to anticipate potential risks and opportunities.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.8"
"4.507","Multi-omics Science","","We are increasingly recognizing that our individual variations in the form, function, and complexity of the interaction of our biomolecular parts translate into unique health requirements - and risk of disease. Even diseases once presumed to be simple, in the sense that a specific gene was thought to cause the disease, are now being recognized as more complex in terms of both severity, and in terms of potential for treatment in light of environmental factors like diet. Accordingly, the precision-based and personalized maintenance of health, and the diagnosis and treatment of disease, requires the coordinated collection and analysis of so-called “multi-omics” datasets that are culled from tissue. “Omics” approaches to biomedicine (involving fields that end in “-omics”) comprehensively assess biomolecules like genes and proteins at a scale equal to entire cells and organisms. That means that while genetics is the study of the form and function of specific genes, genomics is a high-throughput interrogation of all of the genes in an organism; transcriptomics is meanwhile the system-wide study of gene expression, while metabolomics relates to metabolites (the products of metabolism, such as amino acids), and proteomics are tied to proteins. The application of machine learning and other statistical pattern-recognition tools to multi-omics datasets can facilitate a shift from reactive medicine to a fundamentally proactive form of predictive and precision health.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.109"
"4.508","Multicultural Identity","","Australia is a nation of immigrants. The Aboriginal First Peoples migrated to the country around 65,000 years ago, from Maritime Southeast Asia and New Guinea. It was not until 1778 that European settlement began, with the establishment of British penal colonies. Until the mid-twentieth century, the country continued to be characterized as a British outpost. The end of World War II saw a second wave of European migrants, this time from southern and eastern Europe as well as from Britain. With the abolition in 1973 of the infamous “White Australia Policy,” which had effectively barred people of non-European descent from the country, there has been a steady increase in immigrants from Asian, Africa, and the Middle East. By 2017, nearly half the country’s population was either born overseas or had at least one parent born abroad. While English is the national language, an estimated 300 others (including Indigenous languages) are spoken in Australian homes; the most common include Mandarin, Cantonese, Arabic, Italian, and Greek. Increasing numbers of schools are now providing instruction for children in at least some of these languages; the Australian National University now offers courses in more than 25 languages, including Mongolian, Thai, Vietnamese, and Tibetan. Although the government claims to have an open-door policy allowing people from any country to migrate to Australia regardless of ethnicity, culture, religion, or language, in practice successful applicants are limited. Intake for 2017-18 was capped at 190,000, unchanged from 2016-17. More than two thirds of the available places are for skilled migrants. In addition, with the exception of around 500 slots per year, sponsorship by relatives already living in Australia is required. Surveys of Australian attitudes towards multiculturalism have consistently registered an approval rating of around 86%, reflecting a belief that it makes the country stronger. This has not always translated into tolerant behaviour. In 2016, a survey showed that one in five respondents had experienced discrimination on the basis of skin colour, ethnic origin, or religion during the previous decade. Of equal concern are the survey’s findings of an increasing concentration of overseas-born ethnic groups in suburban areas, especially in Sydney and Melbourne. The key challenge here is a need to better understand if these suburbs are evolving into closed communities, which run counter to notions of an inclusive and multicultural national identity - and to what extent we must better promote the integration of new Australians.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.14"
"4.509","Multinationals and Hidden Champions","","Home-grown multinationals and the local operations of large, international companies are major assets for the Swiss economy. In per capita terms, tiny Switzerland has one of the highest concentrations of Fortune 500 companies in the world. Sectors that are represented include commodity trading and mining (Glencore), pharmaceuticals (Roche and Novartis), food and beverage (Nestle), Mechanical and Electrical Engineering (ABB), luxury goods (Richemont), reinsurance (Swiss Re) and banking (UBS and Credit Suisse). At the same time, Switzerland is also home to a large number of “hidden champions,” or companies that are highly competitive on the global market (number one in Europe in their segment, or among the top three in the world), yet are relatively little-known and have annual revenue of less than $4 billion. Switzerland has more than 100 such companies, including bicycle components firm DT Swiss, and medical compression garment maker Sigvaris. Switzerland is attractive to businesses because of its relatively well-educated workers, quality of life, reliable and efficient government, stable economic environment, flexible labour market, good infrastructure, and competitive tax system. However, according to a report published by KPMG in 2016, Clarity on Business Location Switzerland, the country is at risk of losing the advantages it offers to multinational corporations. There is growing international competition from countries such as Singapore, which offer comparably attractive conditions. In addition, high labour costs in Switzerland are a key challenge for companies, particularly mid-sized firms. There is also uncertainty regarding the Swiss franc exchange rate, which can elevate the cost of having operations based in Switzerland. Companies are concerned about recent changes in Swiss labour regulations, which threaten flexibility, while the rejection by Swiss voters of a proposed, potentially business-friendly corporate tax reform in 2017 created further uncertainty. It is likely that the traditionally favourable tax conditions for multinationals operating in Switzerland will not persist, as the country further aligns its policies with the neighbouring European Union and loses more of the differentiation that has made it attractive. If Switzerland wants to maintain its allure for international corporations, it must strengthen its core assets, such as its stable political environment, relatively limited income inequality, high quality of life, dual education system that fosters vocational training, and high-quality workforce.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.125"
"4.510","Multiple and Indirect Functionality","","The expanding requirements of the most dynamic scientific and commercial exploration call for a new, higher level of performance at the materials level. The materials sector is responding, by accelerating its shift to the realm of multi-functionality, where a deeper understanding of fundamental properties is enabling a more bottom-up, bespoke design of materials that can deliver performance in many areas simultaneously, while minimizing compromises. For example, needs residing at the intersection of biology, medicine, and materials will require the integrated design of the physical spaces used to deliver healthcare, so that they include a range of potential solutions. Surfaces will increasingly combine biocidal activity (the destroying or preventing the harmful effects of organisms) with other control mechanisms (for example, implants that provoke tissue regeneration). Meanwhile a combination of bio-compatibility, thermo-responsiveness, and self-signalling properties will open up new avenues when it comes to regenerative medicine. Essentially, materials will be increasingly designed to combine both structural and functional properties. Biology continues to be a challenging but enriching model for advanced materials. Just like the biological systems that deliver activity and selectivity through the coordinated action of multiple agents, we will soon design cooperative systems in which the combination of multiple materials will yield unique functions. Fast and sophisticated experimentation will also propel applications of indirect functionality where, for example, drug-like activity is displayed by the action of ionic species in processes such as cell stimulation or induced turnover. The precise synthesis of catalytic nanoparticles will need to be complemented with biological and other functionalities to break through the existing barriers presented by photo-induced waste degradation. Biology is also showing us how to design better structural composites and materials, which display a degree of autonomy previously only seen in devices. This is happening not through the development of novel algorithms, but rather by mastering basic principles of self-healing, self-cleaning, and self-assembly - and through bio-mimicry, structural self-deprecation, and renewal.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.4"
"4.511","Multipolar, Multi-conceptual","","The geopolitical landscape is in the midst of a profound transformation, giving rise to a world order that is both multipolar and multi-conceptual - not only has global power shifted, but differences in norms and values among geopolitical heavyweights have become more important. The period following World War II, first characterized by the bipolarity of the Cold War and then the unipolarity of US hegemony, has given way to a phase in which power is more diffused among states and blocs. At the centre of this upheaval is an evolution of the roles played by the US and China, and a changing relationship between the two economic behemoths. Meanwhile patterns of influence, cooperation, and competition are also changing among a broader group of countries, including Russia, India, and a number of states in Europe and the Middle East. What is distinctive about the current geopolitical moment is not its multipolarity. The period before World War I was multipolar, after all - but it was also largely uniconceptual. Now, multipolarity is coinciding with a fraying of the idea that the world order can be shaped by shared or converging fundamental political values. More than a quarter century ago, the political scientist Francis Fukuyama predicted that in the wake of the Cold War, liberal democracy would prove to be “the” model for governance the world over. Similar assumptions about a convergence on Western norms have underpinned many geopolitical and geo-economic developments. This has masked persistent differences, which have become increasingly prominent. Many of today’s emergent (or resurgent) centres of power have diverse political values, governance systems, historical legacies, and societal conventions (consider, for example, the contrasting narratives of China, India, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey). This constrains the extent to which some influential states are willing to sign up to a world order that appears to grant primacy to the values and governance systems of legacy powers. It also informs how shared challenges are addressed - as manifested in the current difficulties plaguing many multilateral institutions. This not simply a story of the West against the rest; the multi-conceptual turn in world politics is also evident in Western disagreements about core political values, such as hardening differences among members states of the European Union. Many of the institutions that have shaped global politics and economics since the middle of the 20th century must be reimagined, for a multipolar and multi-conceptual 21st century.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.65"
"4.512","Natural Resource Needs","","As the ranks of the middle class and urban populations grow in emerging markets, demand for natural resources is heating up. Natural resources are a key factor in global competitiveness; they help to attract investment, generate trade, and spur technological innovation, ultimately contributing to the disruption of industries and emergence of new players. As countries scramble to meet their energy needs, the most significant constraints include safety and perception issues associated with nuclear power, slow progress in developing in carbon-capture technologies, and limited hydroelectric and biofuel production (however, wind and solar power are becoming more cost competitive, and natural gas is becoming more plentiful). The home countries of many emerging multinationals face formidable challenges in terms of energy sufficiency, raw materials procurement, and water security. These firms therefore have an incentive to invest and innovate in related areas. In Brazil, for example, local companies have become global leaders in terms of sustainability, while Chinese firms have made great inroads in wind and solar energy. Emerging multinationals promise to play ever larger roles in the race to more efficiently consume and leverage natural resources. The need to address demands for greater sustainability will affect the ways that emerging multinationals operate and serve customers. Massive energy demand will force significant changes in consumer behaviour; estimates published in the 2014 book Green Power indicate that improved consumer habits could reduce demand for electricity and fuels by as much as 30%. In addition, the sharing economy, especially in big cities, could bring about a rationalization of demand for transportation, while electric cars will reduce the demand for fossil fuels. Meanwhile developments in materials science could limit the need for emerging multinationals to look abroad for partnerships as a means to secure resources that are unavailable at home - and may instead enable them to engineer their own materials necessary to meet production needs. Materials science is making so much progress that our dependence on staples such as aluminium, copper, and coal might be drastically reduced. Composite materials are replacing metals on aircraft, in automobiles, and in buildings, while nanotechnologies offer the possibility of smart materials engineered to be more flexible or more heat resistant.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.46"
"4.513","Nature and Human Health","","Good human health depends on nature to provide a steady supply of nutritious food, clean air, water, and spiritual and cultural enrichment that boost mental well-being. Green spaces can reduce the incidence of non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, according to a report published in 2018 by the World Health Organization, and exposure to biodiverse green space provides a connection to nature that could benefit the 700 million people estimated to be affected by mental health issues. While human activity and the loss of vegetation in urban areas makes them hotter than surrounding rural areas, urban green infrastructure such as parks and trees can help filter out air pollution, reduce noise, and provide cooling and shade that reduce this heating effect (and help cities adapt to climate change). Biodiversity is also a source of genetic information valuable for research into new medicines, and into ways of bolstering food security by reducing dependence on a small number of staple crop varieties. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) estimated in a 2019 report that roughly 821 million people face food insecurity in Asia and Africa alone. The IPBES report also warned that negative trends in biodiversity will undermine efforts to achieve United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, including the goal of ensuring a healthy a life for everyone. Biodiversity loss and reduced human contact with the natural environment threaten to reduce diversity in human microbiota, which may lead to a weakening of immunity and the onset of non-communicable disease, according to the WHO’s 2018 report. Other health risks tied to the degradation of nature include vector borne diseases. Malaria, one of the largest causes of death in the Southern Hemisphere, is aggravated by deforestation and poorly-built and -designed water systems; as the climate changes and forests are degraded, mosquitoes are increasingly traveling to new areas while carrying vector-borne diseases like malaria, dengue fever, and Zika. Greater public awareness needs to be raised about the dependence of human health on healthy ecosystems, in order to boost collective action and avoid related risks. The IPBES report made clear that only “transformative” change will reverse biodiversity loss - its recommendations included better protecting natural habitats, and introducing more green infrastructure into cities.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.21"
"4.514","Nature-Based Solutions","","While conventional development often depletes natural resources and uses up vast amounts of energy-intensive materials, nature-based solutions can be applied to related problems in a sustainable way that benefits both people and biodiversity. For example, protecting and restoring forest ecosystems in upper river catchments (where rainfall collects) can reduce the risk of floods and landslides, prevent soil erosion, and improve water quality. This type of natural flood management can also be combined with engineered infrastructure in order to deal with severe rainfall events. Other nature-based solutions include “biomimicry,” or using nature as the inspiration or blueprint for products like medicines and advanced materials; self-cleaning paints inspired by the natural ability of the lotus leaf to remain pristine, for example, now generate hundreds of millions of dollars in annual revenue. This harvesting of knowledge from nature is a key element of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. In a distinct but related way, nature-based solutions can also play a vital role in mitigating climate change - by locking up stores of carbon in the biomass making up forests, wetlands and other ecosystems. Nature can also help absorb the impacts of climate change via urban parks, street trees, and green walls and roofs that can cool cities, reduce flooding, and filter out pollution - with less environmental impact than traditional solutions like air conditioning and concrete flood defences. While engineered solutions can be costly and require long-term maintenance, the costs of nature-based solutions are offset by multiple benefits. Coral reefs protect hundreds of millions of people from coastal flooding, for example, so their restoration is ultimately significantly cheaper than building and maintaining artificial breakwaters. In the US alone, coral reefs provide $1.8 billion-worth of free flood risk reduction every year, according to a report published by the US Geological Survey in 2019, while also serving as fish nurseries, tourist attractions, and carbon stores. Still, the potential for nature-based solutions to enhance natural habitats and restore and regenerate ecosystems is not always fully realized; carbon storage strategies often involve monoculture planting of non-native tree species, for example, which have little-to-no benefit for biodiversity. Only through evidence-based project design, sound governance, and greater awareness can we use nature to cost-effectively tackle both climate change and the biodiversity crisis.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.21"
"4.515","Nature’s Limits","","It has recently become clear that as the global economy expands, we are exceeding environmental limits on the supply of key resources like fish stocks and fertilizer, and on the natural world’s capacity to absorb the waste products of economic activity like carbon dioxide emissions, pollution, and plastic waste in rivers and oceans. Plastic pollution has increased tenfold since 1980, according to a report published in 2019 by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), and as much as 400 million tons of heavy metals, solvents, toxic sludge and other waste from industrial facilities is being dumped annually into global waters. In addition, according to the report, fertilizers entering coastal ecosystems have generated more than 400 ocean “dead zones,” or areas where the oxygen required to sustain marine life has been depleted, which cover nearly 250,000 square kilometres - an area greater in size than the United Kingdom. Negative trends like this are expected to continue until the year 2050 and beyond, barring “transformative” policy change, according to the report. Traditionally, discrete parts of the world have often dealt with their respective environmental limits by externalizing consumption and shifting waste management to other regions. However, those options are not available when dealing with planetary limits. A better understanding of the dynamics of these planetary limits can help inform business planning, and reduce the risk of the collapse of cod fisheries, or of the disease-induced collapse of agricultural products such as bananas and coffee. There are opportunities to work in a way that is more in tune with nature, in order to both reduce the negative impact of economic activity and to facilitate adaptation. The IPBES report estimated that as a result of unprecedented rates of habitat loss and the over-exploitation of resources, one million species are now under threat of extinction. However, the report noted that it is not too late to reverse this trend by reducing consumption and moving to sustainable production methods. Agriculture, for example, should protect biodiversity while it provides food security; both the public and private sectors should become more engaged in conserving the diversity of crop and livestock breeds, and in empowering consumers to make sustainable choices.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.21"
"4.516","Neural Tools","","Advances in sophisticated and wearable technology to monitor brain health are revolutionizing efforts in the early detection of neural disease. A new generation of devices is being created to improve and enhance the quality of life. Smartwatch-based devices can now monitor epilepsy patients, and notify family members and caretakers when seizures occur. Other devices are being developed for recording with great precision the motion of patients with Parkinson’s disease or multiple sclerosis. Such wearable devices should greatly improve care by providing comprehensive monitoring with objective and sophisticated analysis of symptoms in real time. Surgically-implanted neurostimulators are now widely used to treat a broad range of brain disorders. Neurostimulators are devices that use microelectrodes to deliver non-damaging electrical pulses to restore activity in brain circuits that have lost their normal inputs. The most widely used and arguably most effective neurostimulators are cochlear implants that restore some level of hearing in deaf patients. Hundreds of thousands of patients worldwide have received these implants. Deaf children who receive an implant before they are 18 months old can develop language skills similar to their hearing peers. Another application of neurostimulators is in deep brain stimulation (DBS), which is used to treat an ever-increasing range of conditions. DBS has been employed most extensively in Parkinson’s disease, where it can provide relief of tremor, stiffness and walking problems. DBS is also emerging as an important treatment option for chronic pain, depression, essential tremor and obsessive-compulsive disorder. The ways in which DBS leads to clinical improvements are not yet understood. Another area where neural tools will make an important contribution is in brain-machine interfaces (BMIs). BMIs link brains to computers using arrays of many microelectrodes. In some cases, the computer operates like a cochlear implant, using the microelectrodes to activate specific brain cells to produce sensations such as touch or sight. Preliminary successes suggest that with further development such BMIs will improve the lives of amputees and blind patients. For example, pilot experiments led by the University of Pittsburgh have used stimulation of the somatosensory cortex to give a patient with spinal cord injury a rudimentary sense of touch when using a special robotic prosthetic. In other cases, signals from the brain are interpreted by the computer and used to control external devices, such as a robotic arm. Technologies such as these have the potential of restoring mobility to paralyzed patients.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.100"
"4.517","Neuroethics","","While we can anticipate impressive progress in neuroscience over the coming years, those advances will not be as dramatic as suggested in movies or in current fiction. In particular, brain-machine interfaces that make it possible to transfer the entirety of a person’s memories or personality into a computer, or to experience a lifelike virtual world created by a computer, will not be a reality in the foreseeable future. The inner workings of the brain are far too intricate and inaccessible to allow the sort of precise and comprehensive access that would be needed for such elaborate brain-machine interfaces. But, while we can defer full consideration of the ethical issues related to mind-extraction or mind-insertion, there are many important ethical issues that arise even with the current progress in neuroscience. Advances from neuroscience are being used to alter human behaviour. In most cases, those alterations are unequivocally good: effective drugs can relieve the burden of pain, depression, anxiety and other nervous system disorders, and the ethics related to these treatments have been long-discussed and understood. However, in the near future technological advances will introduce new legal and social issues that will require attention and discussion. Many issues related to neuroscience are closely aligned to general bioethics, but some issues are distinctively associated with manipulation of the human brain. It is becoming routine for normal healthy individuals to use drugs and devices that enhance their attention, creativity, mood or personality. Questions exist about the safety of such enhancers, but the efficacy and safety of such drugs could easily improve in the future. Perhaps more important are questions about whether these enhancers are entirely beneficial. Critics argue that they violate human nature and authenticity. Differential access to cognitive enhancers might also increase the gap between rich and poor. Similarly, development is proceeding on drugs that can dampen memories. These may offer great relief by easing the pain associated with traumatic memories, or reducing the associations that lead to drug-seeking, but neuroethicists are concerned about whether the use of such drugs will decrease a person’s sense of identity, and they might be abused in many ways. Widespread access to brain imaging tools has enabled the development of forensic psychiatry and methods that can probe mental states more effectively than other psychological or physiological approaches. As behaviours become more tightly linked to specific brain functions or dysfunctions, concepts about agency and responsibility of individuals are likely to evolve, with implications for the practice of both medicine and the law.   In most cases, the benefits of drugs and other interventions on the nervous system are very likely to outweigh the social, personal and philosophical problems that they might cause. But because the brain is the mechanism of agency and self, it is particularly important that informed discussion among all relevant parties be a part of the process as new interventions are developed. This discussion will need to include practitioners from many fields, including medicine, psychology, law and public policy.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.100"
"4.518","Neurological Disorders","","Neurological disorders are diseases of the brain, spinal cord or nerves. They include disorders involving the loss of healthy brain cells. Such loss might be widespread, as occurs with traumatic brain injury or with dementias such as Alzheimer’s disease. Alternatively, the loss might affect specific brain structures, as occurs with brain trauma, stroke or movement disorders such as Parkinson’s disease. Neurological diseases also include malfunctioning of the brain and nerves, as in epilepsy or chronic pain. Neurological disorders, like mental disorders, have a profound effect on quality of life and economic productivity. The World Health Organization lists stroke by itself as the second most prevalent cause of death worldwide, second only to ischaemic heart disease. Research published in the Annals of Rheumatic Diseases in 2014 found that lower back pain causes more global disability than any other condition. Fortunately, rapid advances in genetics and regeneration biology have produced new tools that are revolutionizing the study of the molecular mechanisms that are critical for keeping brain cells healthy.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.100"
"4.519","New Business Models","","The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) boasts a growing market of more than 600 million consumers. ASEAN’s five leading economies, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand, have a collective GDP per capita of $4,390, according to the International Monetary Fund; less than half of that of China, but more than twice the value registered for India. However, making a profit in ASEAN may not be easy, as buyers there are particularly price sensitive and demanding. Local businesses operate on low margins, and with low labour costs, making them formidable competitors to foreign rivals. Innovation is particularly important for the region in relation to underdeveloped institutions and infrastructure, which complicate the delivery of products and services. Companies must deliver value to customers under relatively difficult conditions, and at low cost for consumers with limited spending power. Mobile technology can be particularly useful for creating solutions that compensate for weak infrastructure; Wing, a Cambodian firm, uses relatively simple mobile technology and a network of local agents to provide payment services to customers who need to work around an underdeveloped banking infrastructure, for example. Similarly, Indonesia’s Go-Jek provides a ride-sharing service adapted to the local transportation environment by using motorcycles. Companies can also innovate in the sourcing of raw materials. The Prostheses Foundation in Thailand did exactly that when it developed affordable, artificial legs fashioned from recycled plastic yogurt bottles, which can be sold for less than $100. The foundation kept costs low by using amputees as technicians, rather than trained professionals, and it managed to find a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records for donating the most prosthetics from a single organization (864 artificial legs over 13 days in 2012). A single business model is unlikely to work equally well across all ASEAN countries, given the cultural and economic diversity of the region. Government support can help ensure that companies are encouraged to innovate, by reducing their potential costs related to failure. This can be done with a so-called “light touch” regulatory approach, which fosters creativity and entrepreneurship. One example: the Monetary Authority of Singapore provides a “sandbox” innovation space for financial technology startups, within which financial institutions and innovators can test new products. As banks grapple with a new regulatory environment, a new breed of alternative providers of capital has emerged: so-called shadow banks, which function as intermediaries but are not necessarily regulated. These have included everything from hedge funds, to payday lenders, peer-to-peer lenders, and crowdfunding platforms. They challenge traditional financing models, while incurring relatively lower costs than traditional banks. They also pose greater risk to general financial stability. According to a report published by the Basel, Switzerland-based Financial Stability Board in 2018, the “narrow measure of shadow banking,” which includes non-bank financial entities that are considered to pose financial stability risks, rose by 7.6% in 2016, to $45.2 trillion, in 29 jurisdictions measured. That amount represented 13% of all global financial assets for the period, according to the report - and more than 75% of related assets were in just six jurisdictions. The addition of China alone to the mix of jurisdictions increased the narrow measure by $7 trillion, according to the report. For many banks around the world, the recent past has been marred by the commoditization of their products and services, and by a pressing need to shrink balance sheets and scale back on lending - in order to comply with post-crisis regulations. This pullback has curbed profitability, especially in businesses like fixed income (trading in instruments like debt, which are tied to interest rates), and currency and commodities trading. Policymakers’ push during the past decade to centralize clearing on many tradable products has also impacted banks’ bottom lines. While advances in technology have enabled more automation and cost cutting at banks, these same advances have also activated new potential competitors. Specialized, financial technology-focused (FinTech) firms can now offer products and services at a much lower cost than most traditional banks. This is pushing these traditional financial institutions to press ahead with significant overhauls of their business models in response - and to cultivate better ties with startup communities in order to gain insight into relevant innovation and launch new services. Global investment in fintech startups reached nearly $58 billion during the first half of 2018 alone, exceeding the total amount registered during the prior year, according to a report published by KPMG.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","['1.2', '1.18']"
"4.520","New Disruptive Technologies","","Digital disruptions are rapidly changing the socioeconomic landscape. Rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI), the cloud, the so-called Internet of Things, data analytics and quantum computing promise to create tremendous value. At the same time, they will also fundamentally alter the way we live, work and interact with one another. The human brain has inspired new developments in artificial intelligence. A recent study published in Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience suggested that because human intelligence can be mapped using relatively simple mathematical logic dubbed  ”Power-of-Two”-based permutation logic,  AI will outpace human capability. For now, the types of AI being deployed are extremely limited, despite the technology’s wide-ranging potential. Virtually all recent AI developments are the same type, characterized by input data being translated into a quickly-generated, simple response. But this trend will not last.  When it comes to the Internet of Things, exciting breakthroughs have been made that enable communication between devices, like a phone talking to a washing machine. As these devices process larger amounts of data in order to maximize their performance, it will in turn require greater data processing capabilities. The use of so-called big data analytics to analyse all of that information is becoming increasingly important. According to the 2015 report Deep Shift: Technology Tipping Points and Societal Impact, issued by the World Economic Forum Global Agenda Council on the Future of Software & Society, big data analytics will enable businesses and governments to provide efficient, real-time support for everything from customer service to filing taxes.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.78"
"4.521","New Economic Thinking","","While there are significant disparities from place to place, no country in the world currently has a life expectancy rate lower than the highest rate as of 1800. During the past century, the global population living in absolute poverty has declined from 82% to just 9%, while the number of functioning democracies has increased to 123 from 16 - in addition, the global literacy rate has jumped to 85% from 32%. Economic growth has been at the heart of these improvements. However, we are seeing troubling signs; for many people in the world, life has stopped getting better. According to the Lancet Commission on pollution and health, an initiative started by the medical journal The Lancet, the Global Alliance on Health and Pollution, and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, environmental pollution has reduced annual global economic output by 6.2%, and caused roughly 9 million premature deaths. Workers in some cities now spend an average of one to two work weeks per year stuck in traffic jams, inequality among the rich and the poor is increasing, and levels of personal, corporate, and sovereign debt are reaching new highs. Meanwhile the geopolitical landscape has shifted to a multi-conceptual framework, where traditional, singular ideas about how best to look after world affairs have splintered into multiple approaches, and often-conflicting agendas. The increased prevalence of protectionist trade policies, and a broad decline of commitments to rules-based multilateralism are threatening to exacerbate tensions. The innovations fuelling the Fourth Industrial Revolution are also raising questions about traditional economic assumptions - in relation to productivity, work, education, and the use of data. In the face of these trends, we must explore ways to update our economic models and systems, in order to ensure they deliver positive outcomes for humanity as a whole for the coming century and beyond.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.123"
"4.522","New Leadership","","There are a variety of international agreements on the environment and sustainability, including the Paris Agreement on climate change, an amendment to the Montreal Protocol intended to decrease hydrofluorocarbon gases, and an International Civil Aviation Organization agreement to ensure zero net growth in carbon emissions from international aviation starting in 2020. Now, the focus has shifted from negotiating these agreements to implementing related commitments. As this unfolds, new players have emerged to take on leadership roles. These players include national, state, and city governments, and corporate decision-makers. China in particular is emerging as a leader on environmental action (particularly on climate change), and the extent to which it matches its international commitments with domestic action will have significant, global implications. China joined the US in taking a leadership role on negotiating and ratifying the Paris Agreement on climate action, for example - and while the US subsequently announced in 2017 that it intends to withdraw from the deal (countries are technically unable to leave until 2020), China has continued to reaffirm its commitment. Analysts expect China to reach peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030. Much of the country's reduction of emissions and coal consumption in recent years has actually been the result of an economic slowdown. Still, China has proactively introduced laws to tax corporate pollution, and it has issued its first green bond (debt raised specifically for the funding of environmental projects). Other countries are also developing strong domestic policies to match their international commitments; in 2016, Canada released a Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change, which includes a national carbon price, a phasing out of coal-fired power, and cleaner fuel standards. Combined with the actions being taken by individual states in the US such as California (where the state legislature approved legislation in 2018 that requires 100% of electricity to come from carbon-free sources), this suggests that climate action will continue in North America, despite recent challenges. Meanwhile in Indonesia, a moratorium was issued on the conversion of peatland, which could help prevent forest fires and reduce emissions. Decisive action on the part of such leaders will be essential for achieving many United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, which were adopted in 2015 as a way to guide development through 2030.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.48"
"4.523","New Norms of Collaboration","","By better connecting academic researchers, private sector organizations, non-profits and government agencies, the transmission and shared analysis of big data can lead to more fruitful discoveries. However, data collaboration will only remain viable if it can be done securely. This entails data anonymization that minimizes so-called re-identification, and international collaboration among lawmakers and law enforcement agencies. As the cyber world increasingly inserts itself into to the physical world, there is a hunger for new ways to collaborate. Consumers, for example, are looking for different ways to collaborate with both with each other and with the businesses they patronize. Meanwhile the increased prevalence of cyberattacks has pushed governments and businesses to seek out more productive ways of collaborating in order to better protect themselves. According to the results of a survey of thousands of executives in more than 100 countries published in 2017 by the consultancy PwC, 44% said they do not have an overall information security strategy, even as the tools for conducting cyberattacks are proliferating around the world. Though attempts have been made to establish cyber security frameworks, such as the European Union’s Cyber Security Strategy, there is a general lack of understanding about how states and organizations should conduct themselves in cyberspace. Each industry is susceptible to different kinds of cyberattacks; the financial industry must often deal with phishing emails, for example. Data sharing within an industry can therefore help afflicted organizations better understand the most pertinent threats. Other types of cyberattacks, like ransomware, which can hold an internet user’s personal data hostage, are directed at all industries. Researchers studying such threats in both academia and the private sector need to be able to operate with relatively low risk. Organizations like the Canadian Cyber Threat Exchange can help facilitate related discussions, and provide secure forums for information exchange. In addition, international legal organizations such as Interpol should continue to be fine-tuned, in order to better take into account the international nature of cybercrime. A white paper published by the World Economic Forum’s Global Agenda Council on Cybersecurity in 2016 recommended that the public and private sectors explore new ways of collaborating that leverage the perspectives of governments, companies, civil society and academia.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.38"
"4.524","New Patterns of Consumption","","Many of our notions about consumption must be rethought. The consumption of retail goods is still an omnipresent driver of the global economy, though new forces are at work that challenge us to think differently about retail and consumption patterns. Consumer Expenditure data from the US Bureau of Labour Statistics suggest that spending among those with the highest incomes has shifted in the post-financial crisis period, with less emphasis on material goods. Instead, people in this group are now more interested in buying experiences, and in key, long-term investments like retirement and education. And while the middle class is still spending significantly on material goods, economists point to wage stagnation as a significant hindrance for people in this group living in developed countries including the United Kingdom and the US. According to a report published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 2018, annual nominal hourly wage growth in OECD countries has fallen to 2.1% in recent years from 4.8% in the pre-financial crisis period. The UK actually experienced a decline in annual average real wages between 2007 and 2017, according to OECD data.  The importance of spending by the global middle class on cars and other material goods cannot be overstated. Given the median wage stagnation for the middle class in a number of high-income countries, the expanding middle class in developing countries has had to take up the slack. In 2015, North America accounted for 18% of global middle class consumption, though that is expected to fall to 10% by 2030, according to a report published by the Brookings Institution in 2017; meanwhile Europe’s share is expected to decline from 31% to 20%. Over the same period, the middle class spending accounted for by the Asia Pacific region is expected to grow to 57% from 36%, as China replaces the US as the largest contributor to the global consumer economy, according to the report. Meanwhile in terms of spending among the wealthy elite, the rise of experience-driven consumerism was well documented in Chrystia Freeland’s 2012 book Plutocrats - a portrait of a global super-elite who enjoy far greater wealth than that enjoyed by their (also wealthy) predecessors only a few decades earlier.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.114"
"4.525","New Technologies","","Technology and innovation have been associated with the developed world for centuries. Now, they have become significant elements of emerging markets, thanks in large part to the multinational corporations that are cropping up those regions, according to a report published in 2016 by Cornell University’s SC Johnson College of Business. According to the Global Innovation Index 2017, published by Cornell, INSEAD, and the World Intellectual Property Organization, up-and-coming countries in terms of innovation development include Viet Nam, Indonesia, and the Philippines, while agricultural research & development has reached a high standard in countries including China, India, and Brazil. China, which ranked 22nd on the 2017 index (one notch ahead of Australia), has spawned technology champions including e-commerce firm Alibaba, and newer entrants such as payments firm Ant Financial. New technologies associated with the Fourth Industrial Revolution are disrupting entire industries, and making it easier for emerging multinationals to succeed - by breaking old clichés regarding trade-offs between quality and cost, and by changing the way we think about the interaction between humans and their environment. Historically, the most important way in which technology transformed an economy was by changing the cost and productivity of capital and labour. Now, developments like machine learning might erase the distinction between manual and cognitive labour entirely, while the use of big data and 3D printing may transform supply chains and healthcare. Many emerging markets now have better-than-average rates of internet and mobile phone use, and people there are becoming more digitally literate - at a time when related skills can be applied to cutting-edge fields including nanotechnology, which promises to develop stronger materials, and nanomedicine, which promises new diagnostic tools and treatments. Already, mobile banking and payments are more prevalent among Asian and African consumers than in Europe and the US. Emerging multinationals are poised to take advantage of these trends and technologies to a greater extent than established companies, because they can leap-frog from intermediate to advanced technologies without being weighed down by historical legacies. They may also be more used to interacting with consumers virtually in their home markets, and could be in a better position to gather data from them. However, the potentially negative consequences of increased technology use and automation include greater wealth inequality, mounting political populism, and other ethical issues likely to keep scholars and regulators busy for a long time.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.46"
"4.526","New Ways to Finance Mining","","After the commodity boom in the first decade of the 21st century - a phenomenon triggered by demand from China and other emerging economies often dubbed the “super cycle” - prices collapsed. Mining companies were forced to focus on reducing debt ratios, and generally improving their balance sheets. Meanwhile traditional equity and debt markets relied upon to fund the industry dried up, so companies have had to seek out new means to restoring financial health. One avenue has been to improve productivity through greater automation and digitalization. Another is the adoption of “lean” and “design” thinking approaches, which involve developing a lean startup culture, maintaining budget flexibility, and pursuing multiple opportunities that vary in terms of time horizon, risk, and value but are strategically aligned. Companies can also devise alternative financing solutions. These could include bulking up on both royalty and metal streaming agreements; the first involves providing cash for a project in return for a regular royalty payment (calculated as a percentage of sales) once the project starts producing or making returns, while the second has investors receive minerals purchased at a pre-agreed price generally below market rate. These novel financing methods create the benefit of not burdening a mining company’s balance sheet, while transferring both risk and reward to investors interested in gaining more exposure to the minerals market. Even as mineral prices rise, it is likely that these solutions will nevertheless persist -  because they can be attractive options for relatively high-risk, capital-intensive mining projects that require significant amounts of time to provide a return. For traders, the metal streaming approach can be a particularly attractive option for securing metal supplies. Mining companies may also increasingly seek to develop joint ventures similar to those favoured by the oil and gas sector, which can reduce exposure to individual projects and jurisdictions. To further limit their exposure, mining companies may even develop service agreements, where governments in countries where they operate, or other third-party investors, own and finance a project while the mining company itself only provides services for a pre-agreed fee.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.99"
"4.527","New Ways to Make, Do and Buy","","Virtual and augmented reality have been readily adopted across manufacturing operations to improve efficiency, safety, and connectivity in product development, maintenance and repair. In product design, remote collaborations are possible, and products can be experienced before they are even made, increasing the product quality for consumers. In 2016, the MIT Technology Review reported how employees at a commercial construction company were using augmented reality technology to avoid problems before beginning work on a site. A review of the project undertaken via Microsoft’s HoloLens computer uncovered some inconsistencies in measurement that could still be fixed before implementation, allowing for cost savings on the eventual delivery of the building and a smoother delivery process. While virtual reality (VR) can help businesses pre-visualize store layouts before they are built, augmented reality (AR) can fundamentally change the way retailers deliver their products to consumers. The functionality and quality of products can be assessed from anywhere, anytime. A September 2016 Harvard Business Review article presented several possible use cases: virtually trying on clothing in the comfort of one’s own home; testing out the look and fit of furniture directly in one’s house; or possibly allowing friends in different locations to shop for goods together. The free AR app KabaQ, released in 2017, can render compelling 3D models of food allowing customers to preview their meals using a tablet device before ordering. AR may prove to be the easiest option for retailers seeking to explore this sphere, given that AR can be accessed on any smartphone. VR on the other hand still requires special equipment and may be more suitable for businesses rather than consumers at the moment. Nevertheless, VR shopping will likely take off once the technology matures.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.133"
"4.528","New Work Models","","Unlike full-time, permanent employment, temporary, part-time and independent contracting work is often not adequately accounted for in traditional labour statistics (in both advanced and developing economies). This is a pressing issue, given that recently-published research in the US demonstrated that a significant proportion of net employment growth since 2005 has occurred in the independent or self-employed category - meaning that what was long deemed “non-standard” work is becoming the new norm. Worker classification and related labour regulation need to be updated in order to match the needs of growing segments of the global workforce. By 2027, for example, it is estimated that more than half of the roughly 145 million working Americans will fall within the “independent workers” category - yet, current legal standards in many countries for what constitutes an actual employee rather than a contractual worker are vague. Clearly, a broader range of work models needs to be formally recognized. It is also critical that more related data, research, and information be made available, and that relevant terminology and measurement standards are harmonized within and across countries. The online “gig economy,” for example, which is creating new digital channels for freelance work and generating novel economic activity, is poorly captured in current statistics. Data published by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2017, for example, actually showed a surprising decline in American workers with “alternative work arrangements” compared with 2005, according to a report published in 2018 by the Brookings Institution. Most related studies have been piecemeal, relying on relatively few digital talent platforms to share data, and relatively few countries have completed comprehensive labour market analyses that include these new forms of work. In the contemporary workplace, managers are more likely to oversee diverse, geographically-dispersed teams, to assess worker performance with new types of analytics, and to expand their searches for new recruits to non-traditional environments. Future readiness and productivity will depend on an ability to reform workplaces; by 2022, more than half of all employees in the world will require re- and upskilling, according to the World Economic Forum’s 2018 The Future of Jobs report.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.135"
"4.529","Nigeria’s Infrastructure Needs","","Nigeria’s relatively lacklustre economic development can be attributed at least in part to its infrastructure; the country was ranked 124th out of 140 economies in terms of infrastructure in the World Economic Forum’s 2018 Global Competitiveness Index. While Nigeria may have the second-largest economy in Africa (after South Africa), it remains heavily constrained due to its infrastructure situation. In 2016, the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry estimated that the country’s infrastructure deficit amounts to roughly $300 billion - more than 10 times the size of the entire national budget for 2018. In terms of quality of roads, Nigeria ranked 132nd out of 140 economies in the Forum’s Competitiveness Index, while its efficiency of train services ranked 127th (of the roughly 3,500 kilometres of railway inherited from the British after colonization, only a small portion is now operational). The country’s electricity sector is also lagging; it ranked 114th in terms of electrification rate in the Forum’s index. Barring significant basic infrastructure improvement, it is difficult to see how Nigeria’s economy can meaningfully expand. Comparing its infrastructure needs to the extent of Nigeria’s significant government revenue can be a depressing exercise; it can sometimes be difficult to find evidence that funds earmarked for the purpose have actually been spent on infrastructure, which suggests mismanagement. Nigeria’s growth potential is immense, given its large population, abundant resources, and entrepreneurial spirit. In order to address the infrastructure deficit, Nigeria’s government has initiated policies including power sector reforms and the Petroleum Industry Bill (passed in parliament in 2017, to jumpstart growth in the sector by increasing transparency). The electricity sector is being privatized, and the government has implemented a bid to meet 30% of the country’s energy needs with renewables by the year 2030. The government has also sought to collaborate with international institutions and foreign governments in order to better address its infrastructure needs. For example, a number of infrastructure development projects have pushed ahead in collaboration with Chinese companies; China Civil Engineering Construction Company is involved in projects in the country including the Lagos airport expansion, road building, urban light-rail construction, and contract worth a reported $11 billion to build a railway connecting Lagos to Calabar, according to a report published in 2018 by the United States Institute for Peace.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.101"
"4.530","Nigeria’s Talent Pool","","Nigeria’s nearly 200 million inhabitants, almost one-sixth of Africa’s total population, are largely under the age of 40. The country’s youthful demographics could help propel economic diversification and growth. However, limited growth and recession, unstable oil revenue, trade deficits, poorly-funded schools, inadequate infrastructure, and poor health mean that Nigeria’s large population of unemployed youth may pose its most serious internal security threat. In 2018, Nigeria replaced India as the country with the largest number of people living in extreme poverty, according to World Poverty Clock data. As of May 2018, about 87 million people in Nigeria were living in extreme poverty, and six people in the country were being reduced to extreme poverty every minute, according to the data. In the World Economic Forum’s 2018 Global Competitiveness Index, Nigeria was ranked 118th out of 140 countries in terms of healthy life expectancy, and 135th in terms of the skillset of its school graduates. Still, despite the poor state of the economy, and the relative lack of government support, Nigerian entrepreneurs have managed to thrive in a number of areas; not least in the film business, as evidenced by the global popularity of Nigeria’s burgeoning “Nollywood” movie industry (which makes up the bulk of an arts sector that accounted for 2.3% of the country’s GDP in 2016, according to a report published by PwC). A starting point for better developing Nigeria’s human capital would be increasing the budget for education to at least the 26% of the national budget recommended by United Nations (education is currently allocated about 7% of the 2018 national budget). Special attention needs to be devoted to the development of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) skills, at every level of the education system (from nursery to tertiary). In order to ensure the effective utilization of the skills, there should be regular collaboration among schools, the private sector, and the government. In the absence of such cooperation and focused leadership, however, Nigeria’s abundant but neglected human capital might actually become a serious liability that threatens the country’s unity. While investment in Nigeria’s “hard” infrastructure could significantly increase economic productivity and engender sustainable growth, that will only become possible if the country also prioritizes investing in its greatest asset: the knowledge and skills of its people.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.101"
"4.531","Non-State Actors","","Environmental decision-making and leadership is expanding beyond national governments and international organizations. While national governments set the policy context for efforts like the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, and the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, it will largely fall to businesses and state and local leaders to drive related changes. The UN Global Compact’s 2016 Status Report noted that a broad and geographically diverse base of investor and corporate support has emerged for private-sector initiatives that are focused on climate issues and sustainable development. The Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders, for example, is addressing carbon pricing, renewable energy, green finance, and infrastructure. Meanwhile the European Union’s Covenant of Mayors and Compact of Mayors joined forces to mitigate the impacts of climate change in 2016; as of late 2018 the combined organization had received commitments from more than 9,000 cities representing about 10% of the global population. In addition, in 2018, the state of California (which boasts the world’s fifth-biggest economy) hosted a Global Climate Action Summit, bringing together non-state actors to showcase examples of innovative climate action. The UN’s Non-state Actor Zone for Climate Action website had registered more than 19,000 “actions” as of late 2018, from more than 2,400 companies, about 9,500 cities, and more than 350 investors. New platforms will be needed to facilitate and boost cooperation among stakeholders, enable a broader, systemic view of connected challenges, and get a larger and more diverse set of actors involved. The Tropical Forest Alliance 2020 provides a promising example; it advances new approaches to help reduce deforestation within global commodity supply chains. The alliance spawned the Africa Palm Oil Initiative in 2015, which brings together companies, governments, local communities, indigenous groups, and civil society groups in nine African countries in order to reduce deforestation and ensure sustainable palm oil production. Meanwhile the 2030 Water Resources Group has established partnerships involving more than 300 public sector, private sector, and civil society organizations. The group is helping to close the gap between water supply and demand, by changing the ways that water resources are managed in water-stressed developing countries like Bangladesh, India, Kenya, Mexico, and Viet Nam.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.48"
"4.532","Nutrition and Health","","There has been a growing focus among businesses and governments on quality rather than quantity when it comes to agriculture and food systems. This is at least in part a response to rising rates of obesity (even as hunger persists in many parts of the world). More than 672 million adults in the world, or one in eight, are now obese, according to the 2018 edition of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization’s report the State of Food Insecurity and Nutrition in the World. While the problem is most significant in North America, according to the report, it is worrying that Africa and Asia are also experiencing an upward trend. Meanwhile the number of undernourished people in the world is also increasing, to 821 million by 2017, according the report; undernourishment, coupled with severe food insecurity, appears to be increasing in nearly all subregions of Africa as well as in South America. Poverty remains the main underlying cause of malnutrition. In many countries, nutrient-rich foods are significantly more expensive than unhealthy foods, and there is a lack of understanding about the components of a healthy diet. In developing countries, this can trigger “nutrition transition,” where populations simultaneously face rising obesity levels and undernutrition. A broad shift towards western-style diets high in calories, protein, fats, sugars and ultra-processed foods has resulted in unbalanced, unhealthy diets and an increased incidence of micronutrient deficiencies; a report published by the Global Panel on Agriculture and Food Systems for Nutrition in 2015 noted that this affected more than 2 billion people worldwide. The report warned that if current trends continued, the number of overweight and obese people would reach 3.28 billion by 2030, or about one third of the projected total world population for that year. Extensive research on the potential health effects associated with being overweight or obese point to higher risks of cancer, cardiovascular disease, osteoarthritis, and diabetes. A related study published in Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice in 2011 found that the number of adults with diabetes in Nigeria would likely double between the years 2011 and 2030, to 6.1 million. There is also a financial cost to consider - a 2014 report published by the McKinsey Global Institute estimated the global economic costs of overweight and obesity to be roughly $2 trillion per year, or equivalent to about 2.8% of annual global GDP.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.60"
"4.533","Oil and Gas Innovation","","Technology development in the energy sector is constantly evolving, often with profound implications for markets. Technological innovation can increase the efficiency of oil use, reduce the environmental impact of the oil and gas industry, and better enable the use of new alternative energy sources. It can also aid in the exploration and discovery of new sources of oil and gas, and make the exploitation of these resources more profitable. This can work in both competing and complementary ways that complicate market forecasts. For example, technological innovation has played a critical role in unleashing unconventional new sources of oil and gas supply in the US, which has reshaped global energy markets. At the same time, technology has enabled significant cost reductions in generating wind and solar energy - which, coupled with supportive public policies, have propelled more rapid deployment of renewables. Ultimately, technology is helping spur more competition among potential energy sources. In the US, for example, renewables are expected to account for 31% of electricity generation by 2050, up from 18% in 2019, according to a report published by the US Energy Information Administration - while generation from natural gas is expected to increase to 39% of the total from 34% over that same period. Because of the challenges tied to decreasing the use of fossil fuels, new technology will play a pivotal role in helping reduce ongoing carbon emissions. This is the case in terms of potentially large-scale use and commercialization of carbon capture and sequestration technologies, hydrogen solutions, and coal gasification - though related costs and challenges in terms of deploying them on a broad scale make these longer-term possibilities. It is increasingly important to understand how the Fourth Industrial Revolution is re-shaping what is commercially viable to include in the global energy supply portfolio, and impacting local and regional demand, while re-mapping patterns of trade. According to the World Economic Forum’s Digital Transformation Initiative, there is potentially $1 trillion in additional value that can be unlocked by the Oil and Gas industry alone by embracing new digital opportunities.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.104"
"4.534","Open Science","","The Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, founded in 2007, has now amassed genomic samples from more than 900,000 people diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, eating disorders, and other conditions that can now be pored over by investigators from 38 countries. The consortium bills itself as the largest biological experiment in history. According to a former director of the National Institute of Mental Health in the US, the PGC is an example of a successful bid to collect the large amount of data that are needed in order to find a statistically significant genetic signal associated with disease; in a post written in 2013, former NIMH Director Thomas Insel wrote that in 2011, the PGC was able to use 9,000 cases to identify five genetic variants associated with schizophrenia. While none of these variants alone are likely to be genetic causes for schizophrenia, he wrote, they define an “architecture of risk” and could be useful for identifying biological contributions to the illness. An article published in the journal World Psychiatry noted that by 2014, the PGC had used data from about 35,500 cases to identify 128 independent genetic associations with schizophrenia; the PGC now states on its website that more than 140 variants have been identified.        Understanding - even at a basic level - exactly how neural circuits underpin our subjective experience and behaviour remains an enormous challenge for neuroscientists. One response to this has been the creation of open repositories for data like the PGC. Other private and public organizations around the world are also investing in such publicly-available resources. As they proliferate, however, these resources raise questions about standardization and curation. There are also privacy and intellectual property issues to consider. Informed consent is a good start, but oftentimes patients may not understand what rights they are signing away, while researchers may later see a more constructive use for data not previously considered, but which lacks the requisite level of consent in order to be used to pursue potentially game-changing research. Patients, researchers, and lawmakers should work together to highlight the benefits of open data and open science, while putting mechanisms in place that proactively educate patients about their data rights.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.95"
"4.535","Organizations and Business","","The output of any organization or business is ultimately the sum of individuals working together - and behavioural insights can help clarify which practices actually improve cooperation, boost motivation and productivity, and engender team spirit. For businesses in particular, culture, work climate, financial incentive structures, styles of leadership, management, and communication should always be in focus. Behavioural science can augment fair hiring practices, for example, and unbiased promotion and job assignment. To avoid discrimination in hiring, some organizations have adopted blind evaluation procedures. Orchestras, for example, have managed to substantially reduce discriminatory hiring affecting female musicians by having job applicants audition behind a curtain, as reported in the American Economic Review. Another study published in Management Science in 2014 demonstrated that an “evaluation nudge” could help overcome gender bias in recruitment; researchers compared hiring committee evaluations done separately and jointly. As expected, joint evaluation helped facilitate hiring recommendations based on individual applicant performance, rather than on the candidates’ gender or other committee member biases, thereby helping them to select higher-performing candidates. In contrast, evaluations made separately led to the more likely selection of men for jobs requiring math, and women for jobs requiring verbal skills - regardless of these candidates’ previous performance levels in both areas. Behavioural insights can extend beyond the internal operations of organizations and businesses. They have implications for marketing and sales strategies, as they can discern how effectively advertising influences attitudes towards a brand, for example, or the factors that account for the potential popularity of a product. While classic economic models suggest that consumers should benefit from having many choices, it has been shown that, under certain conditions, having too many options can decrease consumer motivation to buy a product, and subsequent satisfaction with it. A study published in Acta Psychologica in 2010 demonstrated that once the number of product attributes increases, and choice becomes more difficult, having many options can lead to decreased levels of satisfaction with a chosen option. In addition to private businesses, policy-makers, too, should consider behavioural insights like these, for example when presenting consumers with options for pension plans or health insurance.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.20"
"4.536","Outbound and Long-Term Investment","","China is increasingly investing overseas, as both state-owned and private firms buy interests in foreign equity, infrastructure, technology, real estate, agriculture, and bonds. In 2017, outbound investment from China slipped 29% compared with the prior year amid tightened scrutiny from policy-makers - but still registered at roughly $120 billion, up from about $43 billion in 2009. In the past, a large share of outbound capital went to resource-rich emerging markets in order to fund infrastructure projects, often supported by entities such as the China Development Bank. Now, China has become a major investor in developed countries, particularly through cross-border mergers and acquisitions. According to data published by UK investment bank Grisons Peak, China’s outbound investment in the first quarter of 2018 went about equally to North America (36%) and Asia (35%), while nearly one fifth went to Europe; the biggest single deal during the period was Chinese carmaker Geely’s $9 billion investment in German counterpart Daimler, according to the data. China’s government-sponsored foreign investment has been anchored by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the Silk Road Fund, and the New Development Bank. In order to sufficiently fund its ambitious “Belt and Road” initiative, which is channelling Chinese investment into infrastructure projects that can better link it to a number of countries in the broader region, the government is promoting public-private partnerships. These have funded projects related to energy, transportation, environmental services, and health care. Further afield, China’s trade relationship with the US has been complicated by President Donald Trump’s unveiling of billions of dollars in tariffs on Chinese imports; plans for tariffs targeting roughly $50 billion in Chinese imports including consumer goods, medicines and machine tools were unveiled in April 2018. In response, China announced billions of dollars of its own tariffs on US imports including wine, pork and ginseng. Analysts have warned that a full-blown trade war between the powers could cut annual global economic growth to 2.5% in 2019, from a previously projected 3%, and financial markets have been rattled as tensions have intensified. While a cooling off may result in the withdrawal of tariff threats, continued retaliatory moves could worsen the situation and have global implications.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.30"
"4.537","Overfishing","","The scientific philosopher Thomas Henry Huxley assured everyone in 1883 that it would be impossible to deplete populations of prolific fish like cod, mackerel, and herring. Within a century, he was proven wrong. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations reported in 2018 that about a third of global fish stocks are overfished - not least because fishing laws promote the philosophy that anything fishermen fail to harvest themselves will just be taken by others. Research published in 2016 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggested that replacing antiquated fishery governance systems with rights-based fishery management tools could increase fisheries’ collective annual profit by $53 billion. These tools can be used to allocate individual fishing rights to local fishermen and fishing communities, and their successful adoption has been documented in Australia, Iceland, and Mexico. Another issue is wasteful inefficiency; many fisheries capture, kill, and potentially discard marine species like sharks, dolphins, and sea turtles regardless of their suitability as potential food, and the damage that this causes imperils broader ecosystem health. Illegal and unreported fishing exacerbates overfishing, and is a growing problem. According to a study published in 2014 in Marine Policy, up to a third of all wild seafood imported in the US is believed to be illegally caught. In the case of long-living, slow-growing marine species, a single incident of illegal fishing can set an ocean ecosystem back by decades. New surveillance technologies and platforms for data sharing are needed in order to rein in illegal fishing; one promising related development is the Agreement on Port State Measures, a global treaty that went into force in 2016 and can curb illegal fishing vessels’ access to ports. However, more countries are needed to back the agreement. There are a variety of other ways to combat overfishing, including a more strategic review of the billions of dollars spent globally on harmful fishery subsidies that, in many instances, promote economically-irrational overfishing (an effort is now underway at the World Trade Organization to pursue related reform). Replicating the European Union’s yellow/red card program for combating illegal fishing, which blocks market access to non-compliant foreign supply nations, is another potential option. Better controlling overfishing and illegal fishing is an increasingly critical element of safeguarding global food security, and of ensuring the health and prosperity of coastal economies.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.103"
"4.538","Ownership, Responsibility and Value Creation","","Ownership can no longer be passive or speculative - and many families have begun adopting principles and practices that enable them to approach their roles as owners in a genuinely professional manner. In order to truly understand what it takes to be a responsible shareholder of a family business today, in an atmosphere of heightened expectations for corporate behaviour, it requires a specific type of education. Responsible families now understand that while they may devolve day-to-day operations to managers, they are accountable for the long-term stewardship of their business. They are promoting meaningful engagement between the board, investors, and other stakeholders, in order to build trust and promote high standards of conduct. They are also putting the needs of the business before their own short-term financial interests, by encouraging long term vision, patient capital investment that does not demand quick returns, and education and training for staff. The primary responsibility of owners is to ensure the long-term success of a business, which can in turn bolster job security and living standards for employees. Responsible owners are committed to the area where they work and live. They know that returns that come in the form of loyalty and engagement are some of the most beneficial. These types of owners are also ideally placed to take on broader, external leadership roles - and more are starting to do so. Amid widespread concern about climate change and growing inequality, businesses are being called upon to assume more expansive social and environmental responsibilities. They can do so by not only looking after financial returns, but by also looking after communities and helping to preserve natural resources. Several studies have shown that such responsible ownership does not compromise commercial performance; on the contrary, it can actually enhance shareholder returns when measured over the long term. That is because businesses that are clearly committed to a responsible corporate vision can better create long-term value, and secure higher levels of trust and respect. Responsible practices are unlikely to stem from a business’s leadership team alone. They tend to have their origins in responsible ownership, typically among family owners. These owners are long-term shareholders, and there are relatively few of them per company, so their relative influence can be considerable. Responsible family businesses can therefore serve as role models not only for other family firms, but for all businesses working towards a fairer and more sustainable economic model.  This key issue is curated in partnership with Denise Kenyon-Rouvinez, the Wild Group Professor and Director of the IMD Global Family Business Center at IMD International.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.51"
"4.539","Pakistan’s Foreign Policy","","Pakistan is struggling to maintain a balance between its relationship with the West and its relationship with the emerging powers of Asia. Despite the economic and geopolitical challenges faced by the country, it has played a constructive role at the United Nations in terms of peacekeeping and development initiatives. Pakistan is also a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (since 2017), is actively participating in China’s Belt and Road global infrastructure-building initiative, maintains relations with Russia, and is seeking to resolve outstanding issues with India. Although Pakistan’s diplomatic efforts are generally appreciated, the country faces a significant amount of criticism when it comes to curbing terrorism, and when it comes to the perceived strategic interests underpinning the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor - a significant part of the Belt and Road initiative that is under development in Pakistan. Pakistan has tried hard to sell the corridor as crucial for improving its security situation, and for providing a better livelihood for its people. However, closer cooperation with China has aggravated nationalist Baloch rebels and triggered attacks against Chinese interests in the country’s southwestern Balochistan province. There are four major issues facing Pakistan on the foreign policy front: domestic and cross-border terrorism, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, the country’s nuclear arsenal, and the current state of affairs in Muslim world. These issues have in turn spawned significant challenges, including a Financial Action Task Force decision to place the country on an international terror-financing watch list in early 2018, and nagging questions about its role in the US military’s effort in Afghanistan (relative to that of India). Afghanistan is critical for Pakistan, which is putting significant effort behind securing sustainable peace and prosperity for the neighbouring country. Unfortunately, much of the world sees Pakistan’s role in Afghanistan differently, which complicates Pakistan’s bid to be constructive. Beyond Afghanistan, Pakistan has sought to help resolve other outstanding issues in Muslim countries. For example, it has inserted itself into the conflict between the Sunni Muslim axis and Iran. Ultimately, Pakistan’s biggest issue is a lingering lack of trust on the part of Western countries and neighbours, which hampers its ability to play an effective role in curbing terrorism.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.105"
"4.540","Pakistan’s Natural Resources","","Pakistan’s land and water resources provide livelihoods for more than 40% of the country’s labour force, through agriculture, forestry, and fishing. These resources are now facing serious, man-made environmental risks. According to the Global Climate Risk Index published by the non-profit organization Germanwatch in 2018, Pakistan ranked 7th among countries most affected by extreme weather events between 1997 and 2016 - with 0.33 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, and losses equivalent to nearly 0.7% of the country’s GDP. The country’s economic progress will be seriously impacted if adequate response measures are not taken. Extreme weather events are only increasing in severity; in 2011, five years-worth of rainfall fell in just four weeks in the province of Sindh. Meanwhile environmental challenges include high temperatures, water scarcity, and air pollution - potentially affecting the agriculture sector. It has been estimated that with every 1°C rise in temperature, agriculture GDP will decline by 5.1%. Higher night temperatures reduce grain yields, as do sudden air temperature increases in early spring when wheat and other winter crops are at a reproductive stage. Land desertification due to soil erosion, wind erosion, water salinity, loss of biodiversity, and poverty are all leaving agricultural land barren. Pakistan’s forest cover is decreasing by nearly 1.7% every year, and the country lost about one third of its forest cover between 1990 and 2010. In terms of water resources, Pakistan has gone from a water surplus to being water stressed, and soon may face water scarcity. According to a report published by the non-profit organization WaterAid in 2018, Pakistan is among the top 10 countries with the lowest levels of access to clean water close to peoples’ homes, and about 21.6 million people go without. The challenges of resource depletion call for more effective governance. According to the Pakistan-based Sustainable Development Policy Institute’s Environmental Barometer, 40% of respondents from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province believe that their government has taken some measures to tackle these challenges, followed by 28% in Punjab, 26% in Sindh, and just 20% in Balochistan. However, the Pakistan Climate Change Act 2017 has provided an institutional setup for implementing the country’s National Climate Change Policy 2012, and it is expected that water conservation programmes will be expanded to reduce wasteful irrigation practices - which may in turn help sustain the benefits of investment made as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.105"
"4.541","Pandemic Preparedness and Response","","Public health outbreaks and epidemics are likely to become increasingly complex. A continued failure to develop resilient health infrastructure and public health systems in much of the world has created vulnerability to future outbreaks - while an increasingly globalized world makes rapid transmission a growing threat. Widespread vulnerability will remain a fact of life until every country is able to develop comprehensive primary care services, garner an adequate number of healthcare workers and available medicines, and foster robust health information systems, infrastructure, and public financing. The World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Report 2016 noted that as of November 2014, fewer than half of the health facilities in Liberia had been seeing patients, while the Liberian government estimates showed that from May to August 2014, skilled birth attendance was 27% below 2013 levels, measles immunization was down 50%, and overall health services were operating at 40% lower capacity. Later, the loss of these services during the height of the Ebola epidemic had a significant impact. By June 2016, more than 28,000 Ebola cases had been reported in Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone, resulting in more than 11,000 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. One key to better tracking the spread of viruses is to understand how people move around and interact on a daily basis. Big data enables the modelling of both how a virus spreads, and the potential for it to be contained. Finding the fastest and most efficient channel to disseminate such information is important for fighting an infectious disease outbreak, and providing access to data for real-time monitoring and detailed analysis is essential - the better the information, the more certain decision-makers can be of their strategy. Meanwhile new technologies enabled by the Fourth Industrial Revolution in biomedical research and digital communications, often developed by non-traditional actors, are creating new opportunities to fight disease. Mechanisms that better bring together public and private players in high-risk geographies in order to address emerging epidemics are likely to pay dividends, and more efficient use of both national and local actors for the purposes of early detection and response is critical. Rather than relying solely on traditional partners and ways of working, new ideas, partnerships, and solutions are needed in order to adequately address these challenges.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.69"
"4.542","Pathways to Equality","","Absolute global poverty continues to decline, and the first United Nations Millennium Development Goal established in 2000 - to cut extreme poverty in half by 2015 - was actually achieved five years ahead of schedule. But even as extreme poverty rates fall, and the wealth gap between industrialized countries and the rest of the world narrows, the divide separating the rich and poor within countries has widened. The inaugural 2018 World Inequality Report found that the inequality gap has grown significantly in Russia, India, China, and North America. Inequality across geographical regions varies significantly, according to the report; while 61% of national income is captured by the top 10% of society in the Middle East, the top 10% captures 37% of national income in Europe, for example. There are compelling moral and material reasons to address this. According to an International Monetary Fund research paper published in 2017, excluding people from the benefits of economic growth can undermine the sustainability of that growth. The World Economic Forum’s 2018 Global Risks Report illustrated the connections that exist between rising income disparity and profound social instability. As inequality becomes more persistent, it can become politically toxic; finding ways to slow and reverse this trend must be a widely-shared priority if United Nations Sustainable Development Goals adopted in 2015, including eliminating poverty and making a quality education available to everyone, are to be achieved by 2030. An important finding of the World Inequality Report was that national policies and institutions play a critical role in determining the distribution of wealth - inequality is often therefore a product of the ways national policies overlap with global governance gaps. As climate change, technological disruption, and geopolitical fragility threaten to worsen inequality, we must address the structures embedded in many of our current social, economic, and political systems that are aggravating the problem. To that end, better understanding the links between corruption, inequality, tax evasion, and human rights is crucial - for both businesses and governments.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.123"
"4.543","Paying for Growing Needs","","The United Nations says that crises are multiplying, and lasting longer. As a result, by 2018 the humanitarian aid sector had a funding gap of about $9 billion. Pursuing new sources of financing is therefore a top priority. Taxpayers foot four-fifths of the bill for most international humanitarian action, mainly through government grants to UN agencies and international non-governmental organizations - while private contributions to charities make up the rest. While the European Union and the US account for about half of all international humanitarian grants, the Gulf states in the Middle East have become big contributors. Other emerging economies have been less engaged, though in 2018 the Chinese government announced the formation of an International Development Cooperation Agency. Islamic finance schemes have also become prominent; one sends Malaysian zakat (Islamic charity) payments to Kenya, for example. In addition, more funds are arriving due to a policy shift at the World Bank that has it steering more money to risky, fragile places, and online fundraising by celebrities, crowdfunding, and social media campaigns have also unlocked significant sums - sometimes playing on the idea of cutting out international aid groups as middlemen. A French YouTube personality, Jérôme Jarre, raised about $3 million for drought relief in Somalia in 2017, and Facebook released tools in 2018 for users to set up their own charitable fundraising campaigns. Meanwhile public-private financial instruments are being tested. Insurance sold on market terms is gaining ground as a means to cover against hurricanes, droughts, and epidemics using private-public mechanisms. Social impact bonds, issued to private investors to raise money for social causes, have financed Red Cross centres for the war-wounded. Data can be used to support adaptive, predictive financing once certain indicators are triggered, reducing the need for guesswork and donor persuasion. Most of these approaches are not yet used on a broad scale or underwritten by wealthy, Western donor countries and organizations, though many corporations are moving beyond traditional charitable giving. Philanthropic initiatives at MasterCard, DHL, IKEA, and Airbnb, for example, are finding ways to aid crisis response. Donor countries are also trying to better synchronize their development and humanitarian planning, in order to reduce long-term needs and tackle short-term essentials. Such closer alignment may lead to a blurring of the lines between development, humanitarian, and peacebuilding funding.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.74"
"4.544","Peninsula Dynamics","","The unpredictable regional security outlook is a huge risk factor for both policy-makers and prospective investors in the Republic of Korea (South Korea). New uncertainty about US foreign policy under the Donald Trump administration, China’s widening influence, and the Russian Federation’s growing interest have all impacted the dynamic on the Korean Peninsula.  Ballistic missile and nuclear tests conducted by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea) over the last few years, had been of a greater magnitude and at a greater frequency than in the past, and have fuelled anxiety in South Korea and around the world. The international community has ramped up sanctions on North Korea, while increasing military investment in the region.  Despite the complex situation, there have been dramatic shifts of directions taken since the beginning of 2018, demonstrating the possibility for a peaceful solution. Following a thaw in relations through the participation of the North Korean team at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympic Games, in April 2018, South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un staged a high-profile meeting at the Demilitarized Zone, where they expressed mutual hopes for peace. In June 2018, President Trump met the North Korean leader in Singapore, with the full backing of President Moon.  With talks fast progressing, there are heightened expectations for achieving a fundamental shift in the region’s security landscape. An integrated and unified Korean Peninsula could lead to a sustainable peace and, ultimately, greater prosperity.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.113"
"4.545","Persistent Inequality in Mexico","","According to a report published by Oxfam in 2015, 1% of Mexico’s population was in possession of 43% of the country’s wealth. By 2016, Mexico’s Gini coefficient, a measure where 1.0 equals complete inequality, reached 0.43, according to the World Bank, compared with 0.40 for US. A report published by Oxfam in 2018 noted that more than 60% of the population favoured raising taxes on the wealthiest 1% as a means to reduce deficits, rather than cutting public services. One means to tackle persistent inequality is through education. As of 2017, based on the results of the country’s National Plan to Evaluate Learning (Plan Nacional de Evaluación de los Aprendizajes), only 8.3% of Mexican students possessed ""outstanding"" language and communication skills, and just 5.1% had obtained ""outstanding"" math skills. Absolute annual spending per student in Mexico is the lowest among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, based on a 2018 OECD report (about $3,000, compared with an average of $10,500 in OECD countries). Some of the reforms meant to address this situation, enacted in 2013, include mandatory tests aimed at standardizing primary and secondary school teacher performance. A fairer tax regime could help reduce inequality in Mexico, by increasing government revenue needed to fund health care services, education, and infrastructure building (while programs that deliver cash to the needy in have been effective at alleviating poverty, their long-term impact on overall inequality and social inclusion is debatable). Ageing is another serious related issue; based on a 2017 United Nations report, the elderly population in Mexico (60 and over) is expected to increase from 10% of the total in 2017 to 25% by 2050. However, only about 25% of Mexican retirees have a pension, according to a separate UN report. More broadly, inequality is being perpetuated by a skills shortage; a 2015 OECD report suggested that a gap between the skills workers have developed and those that companies actually need is one of the biggest recruiting challenges for Mexican companies. Meanwhile Mexican firms’ investment in training ranks among the lowest in the OECD, resulting in a lack of opportunity that is only exacerbated by the prevalence of low-skilled jobs available in the unregulated, informal economy.

In addition, Peru is a “low-density” country in terms of total road coverage, with a ratio of kilometre of road per 100 square kilometres that has been well below the regional average, according to an Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) report published in 2014 and freight transport data. The country ranked 108th out of 137 economies in terms of road quality in the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report 2017-2018, and 86th in terms of overall infrastructure. A combination of insufficient financing and weak governance has limited the general supply of quality infrastructure in Peru - the country’s infrastructure investment gap from 2016 through 2025 has been projected to be $160 billion. Transportation and energy account for half of this gap, and a rethinking of legal and regulatory frameworks, and management model changes, could particularly improve the quality of services in the electricity sector. Issues with the reliability of Peru’s electricity supply are hampering economic growth and business productivity. The Forum’s Competitiveness Report ranked Peru 62nd in terms of quality of energy supply, lagging behind countries in the region like Chile, Mexico and Uruguay. The private sector has played an important role in closing the investment gap, and initiatives financed by the public and private sectors jointly are expected to increase from 9.6% of total investment on average in the years between 2006 and 2016, to 13.6% on average between 2017 and 2021, according to the Central Reserve Bank of Peru.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.106"
"4.547","Plastic Pollution","","Plastics are a clear, visible, and established cause of pollution both on land and in water. More than 5 trillion plastic pieces weighing over 250,000 tonnes are estimated to be floating around the globe, and ocean currents have accumulated them in areas like the “Great Pacific garbage patch” now covering an area larger than Greenland. Agricultural land, surface water, freshwater lakes, and river sediments have all been reportedly contaminated by discarded plastic and plastic particles. Particles under five millimetres in diameter form the most-recently identified microplastic pollution threat - these often include microfibres, or strands of synthetic textiles shed by clothing run through washing machines. A typical, five-kilogram load of polyester fabrics is estimated to produce over six million microfibers in one wash. Deteriorating car tyres are also thought to be a top contributor to microplastic pollution, and are the subject of ongoing research. Microplastic pollution is now globally pervasive; it has been found in every ecosystem on Earth, including the Arctic, deep ocean trenches, and on remote slopes of the French Pyrenees.  Microplastics have also been detected in the digestive tracts of animals including coral and tiny creatures like plankton. This could cause serious harm due to bio-amplification along the food chain - some 90% of seabirds are estimated to have ingested plastic - and due to pollutants or toxins that accumulate on their surfaces. Studies have also suggested that microplastics in marine animals can cause tissue inflammation, affect reproductive success, and alter gene expression (this does not apply equally to all species; for example, about 40% of the fish species studied have actually showed no evidence of having ingested plastics). Soluble plastic additives to shampoos, soaps, detergents, cleaning products, and fabric treatments also present threats as aquatic pollutants - and on a scale that while difficult to quantify is nonetheless likely significant. New technologies for the clean-up of plastic pollution have been developed, but are still far from perfect - or are not applicable on a broad scale. For example, technology solutions focused on removing free-floating plastic from the ocean surface have faced challenges including relatively high costs and unintended negative effects on sea life.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.107"
"4.548","Plastic Recycling","","Mechanical recycling is the only method now commonly used for the large-scale treatment of solid plastic waste. Because every type of plastic differs in terms of chemical composition, mechanical behaviours, and thermal properties, however, conventional mechanical recycling requires pre-sorting to separate non-plastic items and different varieties - which can be costly and time-intensive. In addition, the two types of plastic that can currently be mechanically recycled, polyethylene terephthalate, or “PET,” and some grades of polyethylene, together make up less than half (46%) of all annual plastic production. In order to make recycled plastic products, old PET or polyethylene is blended with virgin plastics in an expensive, energy-intensive process that ultimately results in lower-quality finished material. Further innovation is therefore essential, ideally with a focus on both mixed mechanical recycling and chemical recycling. The latter uses thermolysis (applying heat) or catalysts to break down plastics into their component parts, which can then be re-built into new plastics. Complete depolymerisation involves breaking a plastic down to monomers (molecules), which can enable multiple recycling loops with lower energy requirements - all while maintaining the material properties of the finished product. In general, chemical recycling is under-explored - though it is also the most feasible approach for dealing with PET (it is also expected to become possible for biodegradable and compostable polyesters). Innovative recycling technologies that enable the direct processing of mixed plastic waste without pre-sorting may offer other potential solutions. This would require a means to stabilize the behaviour of mixed plastic waste during the recycling process - and would have to be facilitated by better design of the ways that plastic products reach their “end-of-life.” Plastics additives and impurities can interfere with recycling, and policies that make plastic producers responsible for the impact of the entire product lifecycle may help commit more manufacturers to better design, while improving the economics of current end-use options. Some positive related signs include Unilever’s pledge that by 2025 all of its plastic packaging will be fully reusable, recyclable, or compostable. Moves like this are more necessary than ever before, as new plastics can create problems for mixed waste recycling; for example, PET and the bio-polymer PLA (polylactic acid) can each compromise the recycling of the other if they are mixed.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.107"
"4.549","Plastic Reduction and Replacement","","Plastics are ubiquitous in any modern economy, and could actually be a vital means to help us to achieve several Sustainable Development Goals - the 17 United Nations guideposts designed to help put the world on a more sustainable footing by 2030. Building the infrastructure required to supply clean energy, for example, requires plastic for related electronics, while plastic packaging helps preserve and protect food necessary to feed an expanding global population, and sterile, lightweight plastics are essential for medical devices like catheters, syringes, and IV bags. However, the extensive and expanding use of single-use plastics is causing severe environmental damage. The first priority of any “circular economy” (as opposed to the traditional, “take, make and dispose” model) approach to the issue should be to reduce the overall use of plastics. Just reducing annual growth in plastics demand from the current 4% to 2% would result in a 60% reduction in carbon emissions generated by the plastics sector by 2050. Total global plastic production rose to 348 million tonnes by 2017, compared with 335 million tonnes in the prior year, according to the pan-European plastics manufacturers association PlasticsEurope. Bans or taxes on items such as plastic bags or straws in several countries have already resulted in substantial reductions in use. In the United Kingdom, single-use plastic bag use has declined by 86% since the introduction of a 5p tax per bag in 2014. 70 countries have now introduced bans on single-use plastic bags, and many countries are moving towards full bans on all single-use plastic products including straws, cups, bottles and utensils. However, there are potential unintended consequences of a move away from plastic. These include a possible, related increase in demand for aluminium, paper, or wood - the use of which may deliver a heavy environmental impact. A UK government study found that a single cotton tote bag must be reused more than 130 times in order to have lower global warming impact than a conventional, single-use polyethylene plastic bag. The issue of less-than-helpful alternatives is particularly relevant in countries such as India, which has instituted a ban on single-use plastics - but already has relatively low per-capita use of plastics (11 kilograms annually per capita, compared to 96 in the US), coupled with high economic growth expectations.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.107"
"4.550","Plastic Waste Management","","Infrastructure for the waste management of plastics that have reached the end of their useful existence can sometimes be non-existent - particularly in developing countries. This can lead to plastics being dumped straight into the environment (a study published in 2019 found that plastic recycling rates in developing economies with a minimal industrial base were close to 0%, compared with about 30% in developed economies with regulations encouraging the practice). Where the infrastructure does exist for plastic waste management, it can often be unfit for purpose and a major barrier to both innovation and responsible regulation. Landfills, for example, are unsustainable in the long-term, particularly in countries with high-density populations. They can also be a source of pollution and negative health impacts due to seepage or waste burned on open fires. Despite decades of progressively stricter environmental regulation in many countries and multiple voluntary international pledges to limit marine litter generally and plastic pollution specifically, land-based pollution remains a significant source of harm to the oceans.   Recycling infrastructure in general can be problematic if it is poorly used domestically or relies on overseas processing. According to a study published in 2018, China had imported 42% of the world’s plastic waste accumulated since 1992 - making China’s ban on imported waste in 2018 enormously disruptive for the global plastic waste trade. Many waste flows have been diverted to other countries such as Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, and Viet Nam, despite the fact that the United Nations Development Programme has been arguing since 1989 that the export of waste from developed to developing countries perpetuates inequality. Some countries, following China, have begun questioning their expanded role as repositories for the world’s plastic waste; Cambodia announced in mid-2019 it would return thousands of tonnes of plastic waste found in containers shipped from the US and Canada, while Indonesia and Malaysia have also announced plans to return loads of waste to countries including Australia and France. The scale of the plastic waste problem unfortunately hampers international regulation, which requires action at a local, national and global level.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.107"
"4.551","Plastics and Net Zero Emissions","","The vast majority of plastics are manufactured using petrochemicals. About 10% of all the oil and gas produced in the world goes towards making plastics, which ultimately accounts for 3.5% of all greenhouse gas emissions. While most of these emissions are generated by the production and manufacturing of plastic products, some come from their disposal. About a quarter of all plastic waste is incinerated, causing direct emissions, and 55% is discarded either into a landfill or straight into the environment. Landfills are not sustainable, and up to 40% of landfill waste is potentially burned in open fires in a way that releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants. The plastics industry can act to reduce related carbon emissions to net-zero; there are several innovative, low-carbon feedstocks that are potential alternatives to virgin petrochemicals. Some examples include wood, corn starch, agricultural by-products, recycled plastics, and even direct production using existing carbon dioxide emissions. Polycarbonate polymers, for example, can be made up of as much as 50% carbon dioxide, and can replace conventional polyurethanes used for housing insulation, foams and fillers, locking up substantial amounts of CO2 for decades. Using agricultural waste material to create new plastics is a particularly attractive proposal, not least because it could reduce the risk of land competition for food crops. Corn, cassava and sugarcane crops are already being used to create one alternative biodegradable bio-polymer, “PLA” (polyactic acid), which generates relatively less greenhouse gas over its lifecycle than conventional plastics. PLA has already been commercialized for use in packaging, though its share of the overall market remains small. The scale and cost of the existing plastics infrastructure is a significant barrier to large-scale introduction of these alternatives. In order to be more competitive, alternative plastics will need to be capable of being integrated into the existing infrastructure - and to deliver the same material properties and economics of existing plastics. To reach net-zero emissions, the industry will also need to transition to renewable energy sources to power its operations; this alone could reduce overall emissions from plastics by about half. Ultimately, alternative plastics are unlikely to become genuinely sustainable without having a proper infrastructure in place for collection and recycling.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.107"
"4.552","Policy Uncertainty","","The global playing field for the digital communications industry has changed significantly over the years, due to advancing digitalization. We have moved well beyond the time when the focus for regulators was simply on the competitive dynamic between individual telecommunications industry players. Now, regulators must understand and assess a complicated landscape populated by both ageing incumbents and the younger, digitally-focused players interacting with the industry and providing unprecedented access to an array of services. About 71% of the world’s population will have a mobile phone subscription by 2025, according to a report published in 2018 by the trade group GSMA, and nearly 1.8 billion people will begin using the mobile internet over the next eight years. The explosive growth of social media use, together with the advent of new smart devices, is exponentially increasing demand for wireless data. A fundamental resource needed to meet this demand is spectrum - which is relatively scarce, and subject to the significant influence of policy-makers. In 2017, mobile spectrum auctions raised about $25 billion in funding for the public sector, according to the GSMA report. Conventional spectrum management strategies are based on so-called static allocation, where spectrum is licensed in discrete portions according to a radio standard. In recent years, developments in digital signal processing and semiconductor technologies, and the advent of artificial intelligence-based networks, have led to more agile, cooperative, and cognitive wireless platforms. The trade-offs involved in deploying these innovations must be carefully evaluated, and novel, dynamic spectrum allocation policies - which enable the ad-hoc utilization of spectrum, rather than letting it sit unused in rigid structures - must be formulated in order to unlock their potential. As standards evolve, they should also better accommodate the changing technological landscape - in order to eliminate the fragmentation of development, and to help to reduce capacity bottlenecks. Policy-makers must incentivize incumbent telecom industry stakeholders, to enable the faster adoption of new technologies. Regulators need to tread carefully, however, in order to ensure fair play among service providers. The ultimate performance indicator is sustainability; policy-makers should play a proactive role in promoting energy-efficient, sustainable technologies so that industry transformation can have a positive impact on society.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.39"
"4.553","Policy and Social Impact","","To fully realize the benefit of drone technologies, and establish integrated airspace that provides access to all players, significant regulatory, social, and policy changes are needed. For traditional, manned aviation, developing standards and rules has required decades. Meanwhile product cycles for drones are often a year or less. Civil Aviation Authorities need to accommodate this quicker pace with flexible regulatory frameworks. Extensive changes to methods for certification and authorization for airspace, representing a fundamental shift from systems-based certification to a risk-and-performance-based approach, will be a case-study for the governance challenges underpinning the Fourth Industrial Revolution.  Concerns about privacy remain a significant barrier to widespread drone adoption. The ownership of unintentionally-collected data, for example, is an important issue that must be addressed as technologies mature and drone sensors move beyond mere optical data harvesting. Because criminals and terrorists enjoy the same low barrier to-entry and minimal training requirements for using drones as everyone else, the technology could pose a danger to society. Law enforcement is wary of the anonymous nature of drone flight, where a pilot can be kilometres away from an aircraft, which has in turn limited regulatory adoption. Risks posed by drones may be mitigated by so-called counter drone technologies in development, which can track, disable or destroy potential flying bombs. In addition, the use of drones for socially beneficial applications like disaster management, and the delivery of medical supplies, is likely to further improve public perception of the technology.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.42"
"4.554","Politics and Nationalism in the UK","","Populism and nationalism are on the rise across Europe, and the United Kingdom is no exception. Due to the perception of an unequal distribution of the benefits of globalization, dramatic economic change, and increasingly fragile national identities, nationalism has come to seem like a logical choice for an increasing number of people. The result of the 2016 UK vote on leaving the European Union, for example, illustrated the backlash against a perceived loss of local control over global economic forces and immigration. While many UK voters may have been pleased with the referendum result, they will have to reckon with the economic consequences. Global companies and banks that have maintained significant operations in London (and provide many jobs) have been exploring other options within the EU, such as Amsterdam, Frankfurt or Paris. In April 2018, an official from the state of Hesse, where Frankfurt is located, cited nearly 20 London-based banks that have committed to establishing new hubs in the German city. Prior to that, in 2017, the European Banking Authority, which supervises the EU’s banking sector, had opted to move from London to Paris. In October 2018, Britain’s financial services minister said publicly that 5,000 financial services jobs were expected to move from the UK to continental Europe by the time of Brexit (at that time expected by March 2019).  The role of nation states is increasingly being challenged in a globalized world being transformed by new technologies faster than any government can adequately regulate. In the UK, campaigns in favour of the vote for the country to leave the EU made use of online data firm AggregateIQ to circulate persuasive messages; AggregateIQ had ties to Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm that drew scrutiny for its use of personal information garnered from Facebook and for its work on Donald Trump’s presidential bid (and other campaigns), before ceasing operations. In early 2018, Facebook announced it had suspended AggregateIQ, because it may have improperly received user data. At roughly the same time, a working group established by the London School of Economics and Political Science warned that propaganda disseminated on social media is among the most pressing challenges faced by democracies. Governments need to adapt to the current pace of technological change, and find ways to ensure that technology provides a broad benefit to society.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.129"
"4.555","Pollution and the Oceans","","The most harmful ocean pollutant is - far and away - carbon pollution. In the last decade, the oceans have absorbed nearly a third of the carbon dioxide emitted by industrial activity. This has slowed climate change, but at great cost to ocean health. When carbon dioxide is absorbed by seawater it increases acidity levels, and threatens ocean life ranging from the microscopic snails that feed salmon to the coral reefs that support tourism. Plastics are another particularly insidious form of ocean pollution; according to the non-profit Ocean Conservancy, coastal nations generate 275 million metric tons of plastic waste every year (and 8 million metric tons of plastic enters the oceans). The Ellen MacArthur Foundation and the World Economic Forum jointly predicted that there will be more plastic than fish (by weight) in the oceans by 2050, and the United Nations Environment Programme has recorded more than 817 species of ocean animal that have encountered plastic pollution. Plastic pollution has also been detected in seafood sold for human consumption; a 2015 study by a team of University of California, Davis and Hasanuddin University researchers flagged man-made debris in 25% of seafood market fish, and 67% of all species sampled in the US. According to a report published in the journal Science Advances in 2018, only 9% of plastic waste has been recycled globally - highlighting a need to re-think design and regulation in a way that incentivizes re-use. Potential solutions include policies that curb the use of single-use plastics like bags or straws, or improving the capture of plastics that leak out of waste systems. Researchers have found that just 10 of the world’s rivers are the source of 90% of the plastic pollution entering the oceans, pointing to a possible focus for efforts to curb plastic pollution as a matter of policy and industrial reform - by stopping pollution at its source. Another major source of ocean pollution is the runoff of fertilizers used in agriculture, which are carried down rivers into oceans where they create population explosions of algae and bacteria. This in turn depletes oxygen levels, killing fish and creating inhospitable conditions for marine life. As a result, more than 400 low-oxygen “dead zones” have been documented in the oceans worldwide. The spread of these areas could be limited, in a way that also saves money for the agriculture industry, by deploying a more strategic and responsible application of fertilizers.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.103"
"4.556","Poor Mental Health as an NCD","","Non-Communicable Diseases such as cancer and diabetes are becoming increasingly prevalent in both the developed and developing world - and poor mental health is receiving increasing scrutiny for its ties to NCDs. According to an estimate published by the World Health Organization, as of 2015 more than 300 million people, or more than 4% of the world’s population, suffered from depression, while more than 3% of the population suffered from a range of anxiety disorders. Mental health problems are linked to an increased risk of mortality due to associated physical health issues such as cardiovascular disease and cancer, according to an article published in The Lancet in August 2017; depression, for example, is tied to behaviour such as drinking alcohol to excess and smoking, which in turn lead to increased risk of NCDs. However, according to the article, written by researchers from the Sorbonne, the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research and other institutions, the state of evidence on mental health as a contributor to the burden of disease has lagged behind that of physical health - mainly due to stigma, underfunding, and complexity.  The number of people with common mental disorders is increasing, particularly in lower-income countries, according to the WHO; that is because populations are growing in these places, and more people there are living to the age when depression and anxiety most commonly occur. The WHO has estimated that in 2015 alone, 788,000 people died due to suicide - which accounted for nearly 1.5% of all deaths worldwide that year. According to an editorial published in the British Journal of Psychiatry, the fact that life expectancy for men continued to be 20 years less than life expectancy for the general population, and 15 years less for women suffering from mental illness, reflected a disregard for mental health problems that could be viewed as a violation of the UN’s Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Globally, the majority of people in need of mental health care lack access to high-quality services, according to an article published in the journal Current Psychiatry Reports in 2017 - due to factors including stigma and human resource shortages. That is true even though common mental disorders are responsible for the largest proportion of the global disease burden, according to the article.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.95"
"4.557","Populism","","Populist parties continue to put Europe’s post-World War II consensus under pressure. There are more than 40 political parties in Europe that can be described as populist, in almost every European Union member state - including the Front National in France and Alternative für Deutschland in Germany. Together, these parties hold more than 1,000 seats in more than 20 different national parliaments. At this point, only Luxembourg appears untouched by the trend. While populism is not a new phenomenon in Europe, it used to form the fringe of the political debate. Now, it represents a significant threat to European cohesion. The new populists are sceptical about the EU, oppose interventions abroad (particularly in the Middle East), are unenthusiastic about ties to Washington, D.C. (although for some this changed with the election of Donald Trump as president), and are positively inclined towards Vladimir Putin’s Russia. The European project was founded on the principle of removing barriers to the movement of goods, people and capital; the populists question all of this, and hence threaten the core of EU identity. European Parliament elections held in 2019 ended with victories for a number of populist parties, hardening existing divisions with their pro-Europe counterparts. Populist parties have become more strategic and innovative. Their weapon of choice has become direct democracy via referendum, which they portray as a means to democratize policy-making at a time when the public views legislators as overly bureaucratic or even corrupt. Research by the European Council on Foreign Relations found that populist parties in Europe have called for dozens of referendums, on subjects ranging from membership in the EU to refugee relocation. The United Kingdom’s vote in 2016 to leave the EU demonstrated how disruptive such referendums can be; the EU is based on compromise through diplomacy and turning political issues into technical ones, while referendums do the opposite, by politicizing technical questions. The EU could benefit from ensuring that it is not seen as a force for taking away national sovereignty, but rather for strengthening the national agenda of each member state. It could adopt more flexibility, and place less emphasis on Brussels institutions. Populism in many ways presents a zero-sum game for the EU - countering it in the south by easing austerity measures, for example, could easily lead to more populist success in the north.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.50"
"4.558","Poverty and Inequality","","The majority of South Africans live precarious lives, characterized by a lack of employment, poverty, and inequality. As the country’s population has grown, poverty estimates have increased; according to a 2017 publication from Statistics South Africa, or Stats SA, as of 2015 nearly 56% of the population was living below the poverty line. Meanwhile the country’s unemployment rate was 27.2% as of mid-2018. These are unusual statistics for a middle-income country, and an indication of South Africa’s unique status as one of the most unequal societies in the world. This has its origins in the unequal distribution of assets among racial groups, and results in uneven access to education and economic opportunity. More inclusive economic growth must be promoted, in order to address some of the country’s most acute challenges. Most people earn low wages, or work the informal (grey) economy, while real opportunities are generally confined to skills-based, higher-wage industries (there may be demand for skilled labour, but there is also unequal access to training and education). This amplifies poverty, by creating a dependency on low wages among unskilled workers, who meanwhile face onerous costs related to the need to search for new, better jobs. South Africa is relatively unique among developing countries, in that its informal economy is unsuccessful at buffering against unemployment. The barriers to entry into the informal, unofficial sector of the economy, which leave the vulnerable with even fewer opportunities to earn a living, have historical roots. Apartheid-era legislation enforced spatial segregation, which left many black South Africans in informal settlements separated from the city centre and money-making opportunities. A large portion of the population still resides in these areas, and is heavily dependent on the government for survival. One of the most successful anti-poverty strategies of the post-apartheid period has been large-scale social grant payments, most notably in the form of the state old-age pension - which provides regular income for people older than 60. South Africa’s social grant system is relatively substantial in terms of both size and coverage areas compared with other developing countries, and social grants have been shown to have a substantial impact on poverty alleviation; however, they have been less effective for reducing inequality. It is crucially important to better understand the linkages between social assistance, growth, poverty and inequality, in order to effectively target South Africa’s economic challenges with appropriate policy.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.119"
"4.559","Power System Resilience","","Extreme weather events, a potential failure of climate change mitigation efforts, cyberattacks, and natural disasters rank among the top ten global risks in terms of likelihood and impact, according to a report published by the World Economic Forum in 2019 - and they pose specific threats to the availability of affordable energy. The tangible impacts of climate change are increasingly evident, and developing adequate responses when it comes to energy security requires new forms of cooperation between the public and private sectors; preventive measures are also needed for potential cyberattacks and terrorism. These threats pose risks to critical infrastructure, and to entire economies and societies. Over the course of the past decade, hurricanes, wildfires, flooding, and cyberattacks have amplified an urgent need to make electricity grids more resilient - to harden and smarten them, in order to blunt potentially devastating social and economic consequences. For example, a six-hour winter electricity blackout in France could exact more than €1.5 billion in related costs for households, businesses, and vital institutions there. Meanwhile, disasters in the Asia-Pacific Region over the past 40 years have cost some $1.3 trillion, and every day the region incurs $126 million in direct physical losses because of extreme weather events and geophysical hazards like floods, according to the Asian Development Bank. The financial cost of threats such as cyberattacks is also rising (the total cost of cybercrime for businesses over the next five years is expected to reach $8 trillion). Beyond the immediate financial cost, cyberattacks such as the WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017 disrupted critical and strategic infrastructure around the world, including government ministries and energy companies. WannaCry highlighted a growing trend of cyberattacks targeting strategic industrial sectors, and raised fears that in a worst case scenario attackers could trigger a breakdown in the systems that keep entire societies functioning. Building genuine resiliency means hardening the global power system against high-impact, low-frequency events, and fostering an ability to quickly recover from these events - which can threaten lives and devastate electricity generation, transmission, and distribution systems, not to mention related systems such as natural gas pipelines and telecommunications networks, according to the Electric Power Research Institute.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.44"
"4.560","Power and Values","","The World Economic Forum’s 2019 Global Risks Report expands on the notion that the world is becoming not just multipolar, but also “multiconceptual” - that is, as global power is increasingly diffused, there is now more room for divergent values to shape geopolitics than at any time since the end of World War II. These values-based tensions are showing up in different ways in different places, creating new fault lines within and between countries and regions. Many political leaders and communities feel they have lost control - whether it is to internal divisions, external rivals, or traditional multilateral organizations. The complex global picture that is emerging, of a fracturing of longstanding norms and alliances, may call for a new architecture to advance multilateral cooperation. Critics have argued that the existing international architecture, shaped by the post–World War II balance of power and values, has failed to evolve, and to reflect subsequent global transformations. In economic terms, for example, as of 1950 the US accounted for 27.2% of global GDP, and China 4.6% (on a purchasing power parity basis); by 2017 those figures were 15.3% and 18.2%, respectively. Such shifts in the economic centre of gravity create demands for institutional change. Even prominent architects of the current global system, like the US, increasingly see multilateralism as a costly drag on their freedom to manoeuvre. Multilateralism can be weakened in numerous ways. States can withdraw from agreements and institutions; they can intervene to block consensus; and they can adopt a selective approach to upholding norms and rules. Multilateral institutions can also experience a gradual process of disuse or disregard. Trade is the arena in which the broader implications of a more multipolar, multiconceptual world have so far played out most clearly. Trade relations between China and the US rapidly worsened during 2018, for example. There were positive signs in the final months of the year, raising hopes that a normalization of relations would follow, but the pace of the earlier deterioration highlights how quickly risks can crystallize in this area. Elsewhere, states are taking a stronger economic role. Almost one quarter of the world’s largest companies are now state-controlled, the highest level in decades. Strong-state politics makes it harder to sustain multilateralism. This has been most evident so far in the shift in trade policy from global frameworks overseen by the World Trade Organization, to an increasing number of regional initiatives and bilateral deals.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.70"
"4.561","Preparing for Precision","","Better preparing the health care workforce to deal with the genomic information that makes Precision Medicine (or, ""Personalized Medicine"") possible is vital. A lot of accumulated genomic knowledge, or knowledge related to the genetic information included within a cell, will be embedded into point-of-care decision-analysis tools associated with electronic medical records. When genomic testing becomes routine, clinicians will not have to order a pharmacogenetic test and then wait for the results to arrive, in order to decide on a drug and dosage. Instead, a prescribing system will automatically search a database, find a patient's genomic results, and recommend the proper drug and dosage to use for a specific disease. Clinicians will not only need to know about disease, genomics, and pharmacogenetics - they will need to be able to explain to a patient why a certain treatment is being prescribed. Other competencies health care providers will need include an ability to recognize and order tests when there are indications that diagnosis and treatment would benefit from the use of genomic sequencing. Health providers will generally be expected to have an ability to explain fundamental genetic concepts, and to provide a referral to a genetic counsellor when necessary. Specific competencies must include knowledge about when to use sequencing data in order to improve differential diagnoses, formulate individualized disease management plans, and guide therapies according to pharmacogenetic data. Genomic information should be integrated into all levels of a health professional’s education, and his or her maintenance of certification. In addition, the current model of one health professional counselling a patient about a genetic test will be disrupted by advances in whole-genome sequencing technologies. That is because as the entire genome is sequenced, actionable genetic information beyond a specific test will become available. New methods to efficiently store and query this information in electronic medical records should be built, in order to provide point-of-service information to healthcare providers and patients.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.109"
"4.562","Preparing for Sea-Level Rise","","The solution for mitigating climate change is well known: reducing global emissions. Yet, increasingly, the global commitment necessary to follow through on this is lacking. Respondents surveyed for the World Economic Forum's 2019 Global Risks Perception Survey ranked environment-related risks highest; they account for three of the top five risks in terms of likelihood, and four of five in terms impact. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned in 2018 that we have, at most, 12 years to make the changes needed to prevent average global temperatures from rising 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels (the Paris Agreement on climate change targets keeping global temperature rise to between 1.5°C and 2°C). In the US, the Fourth National Climate Assessment warned in late 2018 that without significant reductions in emissions, average global temperatures could rise by 5°C by the end of this century. The accelerating pace of related biodiversity loss is a particular concern. The Living Planet Index, which tracks more than 4,000 species across the globe, reports a 60% decline in average abundance since 1970. Despite this, many stakeholders are failing to meet the commitments they have made as part of the Paris Agreement. One particularly daunting impact of climate change is rising sea levels in urban areas. Already, an estimated 800 million people in more than 570 coastal cities are vulnerable to a sea-level rise of 0.5 metres by 2050. Urbanization not only concentrates people and property in areas of potential damage and disruption, but also exacerbates those risks - by, for example, destroying natural sources of resilience such as coastal mangroves, or increasing the strain on groundwater reserves. The risks of rising sea levels are often compounded by storm surges and increased rainfall intensity. Many cities have struggled to cope with these mounting challenges. In Thailand, Bangkok is low lying and sinking, its natural coastal defences have been eroded, and the nearby Gulf of Thailand is rising faster than the global average. Bangkok’s surface area is also one of the world’s most impermeable; it averages just 3.3 square metres of green space per resident, compared with 66 square metres in Singapore. Extreme weather patterns are intensifying, leaving the city vulnerable to rising sea levels from the south and increasingly severe monsoon rains from the north. In the last 20 years, efforts to deal with accelerating sea-level rise have shifted notably towards supplementing “hard” engineering strategies with the greater promotion of “soft,” nature-based approaches.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","['1.48', '1.70']"
"4.563","Pricing Climate into Finance","","In 2018, the Bank of England published a sobering report on the preparedness of the country’s financial institutions for the impacts of climate change. According to the report, only about one in ten UK banks were taking a long-term, comprehensive approach to the financial risks tied to climate change by engaging at the board level, publicly supporting more detailed climate-related financial disclosures, and considering how to apply climate-related risk analysis to financial portfolios. Meanwhile 60% of banks were instead taking a more responsive approach, by viewing related financial risk through a relatively narrow and short-term perspective, according to the report. In his introduction to the report, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned that once climate change becomes a clear and present danger to financial stability, it may already be too late. A growing number of tools are in development for financial firms interested in better accounting for climate-related risk. A project undertaken by the Inter-American Development Bank, PwC, and the University of California, San Diego, for example, is designed to integrate climate risk into the credit scoring for agribusiness clients in the Bahia region of Brazil. Another climate-related risk facing financial institutions is tied to stranded assets, or assets like coal, or oil reserves, that may go unused as the global economy shifts to more environmentally-friendly energy use. The value of these stranded assets may not be fully accounted for by the banks that make loans to companies with businesses based on extracting coal, for example; according to a study published in the journal Nature in 2015, more than 80% of all coal reserves should remain unused between 2010 and 2050, in order for there to be a realistic chance of limiting global warming to no more than 2°C above pre-industrial levels (a target set by the Paris Agreement on climate change). According to a study published in the journal Nature Climate Change in 2018, as much as $4 trillion in global wealth could be lost as a result of stranded assets - hitting energy exporting countries like the US, Russia, and Canada particularly hard. Insurance companies also face related issues; a report published by Lloyd’s of London in 2017 noted that the increased rates of physical environmental damage incurred around the world could spur higher rates of stranding, directly impacting international insurance markets.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.52"
"4.564","Privacy and Data Protection","","While a digital identity can enable greater access and add convenience, it also creates significant issues related to freedom and privacy. India’s biometric digital identity system, for example, dubbed “Aadhaar,” sparked public and legal debate that ultimately resulted in the Supreme Court limiting its use - while recognizing privacy as a fundamental right - in 2018. That same year, it was revealed that data analysis firm Cambridge Analytica had harvested information about millions of Facebook users without their knowledge in order to build a political profiling and advertising tool. Some recent responses to privacy and data protection concerns include the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, a requirement in the US state of Vermont for data brokers to register with the government, and California’s legislation enabling residents to refuse to have their data sold. China places strict requirements on data use and transfer outside of the country that give the government priority to intervene. In total, 107 countries have put legislation in place to protect data and privacy, according to the UN Conference on Trade and Development, though more than a fifth, mostly in Asia and Africa, still have made no related headway. Independent oversight from data protection bodies or privacy commissioners can bolster accountability and provide more ways to seek recourse and resolve conflicts of interest on matters like national security and individual rights. Meanwhile the entities that issue digital identities can be disincentivized from unnecessarily collecting and aggregating personal data, and business leaders can be prompted to place a greater focus on privacy. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has urged technology companies to treat privacy as a human right and make it a global norm, while Apple CEO Tim Cook has called for comprehensive privacy laws in the US. Increasingly, governments are embedding privacy into design; Estonia, India, and Austria employ minimal data collection, and use randomized unique identity numbers and tokenization in their national systems. Meanwhile startups like Privitar and BigID are building tools to help organizations conduct big data analysis while abiding by data protection laws. Despite a generally growing emphasis on greater privacy, related attitudes still vary - and identity-related data can be easily abused, or fed into artificial intelligence systems that discriminate. Stakeholders in all sectors and industries should embed privacy and informed consent principles in their business strategies and designs, harmonize relevant regulations, and incorporate independent oversight into identity governance.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.41"
"4.565","Privacy and Trust on the IoT","","The current generation of heavy internet users are digital denizens, creating curated online personas out of heaps of information uploaded to social media sites. These people are also generating detailed “digital exhaust” via the Internet of Things-connected devices with which they either knowingly or unknowingly engage. Third parties with either good or bad intentions can create rich identities out of these data deposits, to use and abuse as they see fit. This issue actually stems from one of the biggest opportunities presented by the IoT: the sheer number of seamless connections proliferating among digital systems. Internet services promise wonderful things, yet users rarely take the time to think about the nature of the information required to accomplish their online goals. It is unusual for a user to actually read a website’s terms of service, and then carefully set his or her privacy controls, for example. Worse yet, there are almost never repercussions for organizations that fail to abide by their terms of service, or that negligently leak information. Better user education could help to reduce the exposure to risk. The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, which went into effect in 2018 and places disclosure requirements on companies aiming to unearth value in internet user information, has helped provide the public with some insight into online data collection and sharing. However, users still struggle to balance consent with utility when it comes to their interaction with the Internet of Things. This is in part because there are serious lingering questions about intent, policy, and procedures related to personally-identifiable information - and because platforms generally lack appropriate transparency on their data sharing and controls. This can be a result of a lack of technologically- and economically-aware governance, both in terms of creating adequate incentives for companies to implement consumer protections, and a result of ill-defined, or under-enforced repercussions for those who fail to design trustworthy systems. Individual internet users and businesses have taken note of this lack of transparency and protection, and have in the past resisted the implementation of the IoT due to a lack of confidence in existing privacy measures and to a fear that terms and conditions can suddenly change without notice. In order for the Internet of Things to thrive, clear and user-centric policies regarding data collection, storage, and sharing must be developed. Appropriate governance could help ensure that maximum social and economic value is derived from this technology.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.86"
"4.566","Private Capital in Infrastructure","","Finding private sources of financing to meet the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, including the goal of developing reliable and sustainable infrastructure, has been a priority at least since 2015 - when the UN released its Addis Ababa Action Agenda emphasizing the importance of blending public with private capital to fund development. Private financing has steadily flowed into public infrastructure projects; according to the World Bank, in developing economies alone there was nearly $1.8 trillion in private sector investment made in infrastructure between 1990 and the first half of 2018. However, after experiencing high-profile failures, many countries that had once enthusiastically embraced the public-private financing model dismantled or seriously reconsidered their programs. In Southern Europe, for example, governments that drew private co-financing for infrastructure over the past decade later got stuck with the bill when the infrastructure failed to generate sufficient revenue, according to a podcast published in 2018 by Wharton finance professor Joao Gomes. The scrutiny placed on private sector involvement in financing and managing public infrastructure as a result of such failures has mirrored a rising suspicion of globalization and multinational corporations more generally. Many scandals have also illustrated the dangers of poor oversight and regulation of public-private partnership schemes. In 2018, the United Kingdom did away with public-private partnerships, for example, following the collapse of construction firm Carillion - which resulted in project delays and hundreds of millions of pounds in costs for taxpayers. Similar issues are causing a re-evaluation of programs even in countries where the model had been deemed successful, including Australia and Canada, and are forcing countries more generally to reconsider public-private partnerships as a means to alleviate pressure on stretched public finances. Many governments, traditionally tasked with financing infrastructure, are dealing with growing liabilities ranging from high social-security and healthcare-related costs in countries with ageing populations, to costs related to providing education and jobs in countries with young, rapidly growing populations. As a result, private financing will almost certainly be required in order to close yawning infrastructure development gaps without also sacrificing crucial government programs. Winning greater public buy-in to the concept of public-private partnership programs will therefore be crucial.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.79"
"4.567","Private Legal and Regulatory Systems","","Private organizations have long influenced the legal and regulatory environment; private security forces and prisons have been part of the enforcement landscape in the US for decades, for example. The role of private organizations is growing, and will continue to grow, as governments struggle to keep pace with technology innovation, global business models, and increasingly diverse populations. Private participation in regulation can occur when an internet search engine is required to adjudicate claims under Europe’s “right to be forgotten,” for example. In some cases, government rules incorporate standards developed by organizations that have private businesses as members, such as the US-based technology group IEEE. Large corporations have long set the rules governing their own obligations to consumers and employees; the volume of this so-called private regulation has skyrocketed. Private regulation is also growing within organizations, as private, global supply chain contracts often include requirements for suppliers, particularly those in parts of the world where government regulation is lacking, to monitor and eliminate child labour and improve workplace safety. Global businesses want clear, reliable regulatory frameworks, in order to better plan. Some of this desire stems from strategic corporate efforts to pre-empt or shape government regulation, and some is simply a response to a failure of governments to act. Private sector participation is essential to help address the lack of access to justice now confronting people and businesses in both rich and poor countries alike. In both settings, governments are increasingly unable or unwilling to fund access to legal assistance. This is prompting efforts to build access through community paralegals, alternative dispute resolution, and legal technology. However, this growing role for the private sector brings substantial related challenges; abuses perpetrated within private prisons have gained increased visibility in recent years, for example, while in the developing world the number of people employed in private security forces is now greater than those in public police forces. Our increased reliance on private sector regulators is largely taking place without thoughtful oversight by politically accountable officials. Regulated entities are often designing the terms on which they will choose to protect the environment, or privacy - with only the free market or company employees imposing constraints. A major challenge for the foreseeable future will be reconciling our need to turn to the private sector for help, with the need to ensure that private sector regulators are responsive and accountable to the public.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.90"
"4.568","Production Regulation and Governance","","In the US, the Food and Drug Administration has reviewed hundreds of 3D printed medical devices, including knee replacements and implants, and has set up 3D printing facilities on its own campus in a bid to better understand the implications of this technology. Governments everywhere have to change their approach to regulation, in order to better account for the quickening pace of innovation. They are also responsible for ensuring that the Fourth Industrial Revolution, a period of dramatic change that is being propelled by the fusion of technologies changing the ways that we interact and create value, produces fair and sustainable outcomes for as many people as possible. As noted in Professor Klaus Schwab’s 2016 book The Fourth Industrial Revolution, government officials, together with business leaders, must carefully weigh benefits and risks of new technology developments - particularly those that could ultimately escape our control, such as artificial intelligence. Ideally, regulation should provide us with resilience as we deal with uncertainty, and should align with the public interest in terms of security, privacy, and intellectual property rights - also while fostering the development of well-functioning and accessible digital infrastructure. Small and medium-sized enterprises in particular should receive the support they need to adopt new technologies; they are a significant source of employment, and often have a relatively greater potential to adopt disruptive technologies than their more-established peers. Technologies brought about by earlier industrial revolutions and still in widespread use, such as the combustion engine, need to be regulated with clear foresight. Potential technological alternatives to these legacy inventions, such as electric vehicles, need to be taken into account by regulators as they as pursue greater sustainability. Ultimately, effective oversight and enforcement is also necessary, in order to protect consumers. And while oversight is necessary, it should not blunt the investment necessary to enable technological progress and to foster competition.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.3"
"4.569","Production Risks and Circularity","","Many companies have taken note that a traditional linear economy, where raw materials are perennially required to make products that are then disposed of, increases their exposure to resource price volatility and supply disruption. A high degree of resource price volatility can dampen economic growth, by increasing uncertainty and discouraging businesses from investing; a report published by the McKinsey Global Institute has noted that the decade between 2001 and 2011 saw higher price volatility for metals and agricultural output than in any single decade during the previous century. Risks inherent in a linear economy are not only related to raw materials - they also stem from long, elaborately structured global supply chains. For example, many parts of the world possess few natural, non-renewable resources of their own, and so rely heavily on imports. In 2015, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources reported that the European Union’s imports of materials and natural resources were six times greater than its related exports; the US Energy Information Administration reported that same year that Japan imported nearly all of its petroleum and and natural gas.. Shifting the way in which we use resources, through the application of so-called circular principles (that is, reusing materials for the production of goods), can address both resource challenges, and environmental issues - including land degradation, the loss of biodiversity, ocean pollution, and climate change. While linear industrial methods generate significant amounts of waste, and have contributed to environmental and health hazards, the manufacturing and production processes in a circular economy can limit the creation of waste. Manufacturing methods such as 3D printing, for example, can reduce much of the waste in the production process, and in situations where by-products are unavoidable, a focus can be placed on exploring possible useful applications for waste. One example: the spent grains from a brewery could be sold to fish farmers, and the livestock sector more generally, to be used as a feed supplement. More broadly, the circular economy, where waste is designed out of the system intentionally, can be applied across the entire supply chains, from product design to production.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.31"
"4.570","Productivity","","Chile is one of only two Latin American countries that have achieved full Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) membership, and it boasts the region’s highest GDP per capita: $13,576. However, economic growth has slowed since 2013, and reduced productivity over the past 15 years has become a concern. In the 1990s, the country’s so-called total factor productivity, a measure of efficiency, grew 2.3% annually; but between 2000 and 2015 it only grew 0.1% annually, according to the Chilean National Commission on Productivity’s 2016 annual report. This decline has limited the country’s potential to improve living standards as quickly as it has in the past, and reflects the challenges of the so-called middle-income trap, a common affliction where economies that have attained increased income levels struggle to spur further growth and innovation. In addition, there are development bottlenecks that are specific to Chile. Nevertheless, Chile remains the most competitive country in Latin America and the Caribbean, ranking 33rd out of 137 economies in the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report for 2017-2018. Its strengths include a solid macroeconomic environment (36th), its financial market development (17th) and its institutions (35th). However, ratings for the sophistication of the country’s business environment and innovation capacity remain relatively low. The biggest challenges identified in the report related to doing business in the country include a limited availability of qualified human capital (particularly outside of big cities), uncertainty related to new labour regulations, a lack of land-use planning and less-than-efficient government bureaucracies. Chile has sought to better integrate into the global economy through international agreements. The country is a world leader in mining; it is number one in copper mining, and accounts for nearly one third of global output. This sector has been fundamental to the country’s economic development, and has regularly represented more than half of its exports (65% in 1962, for example, and 55% in 2012, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity). However, Chile requires structural reforms that will support the development of a more productive, diversified, and knowledge-based economy. A study published in 2016, A Common Vision and Four Proposals to Boost Productive Development in Chile, showed the country’s capacity to develop new export products consistently decreasing since the 1990s. The study also noted that Chile’s traditional economic activities like forestry and salmon fishing have meanwhile drawn increasing pressure from environmentalists and created social conflict. Chile’s primary development challenge is to boost productivity growth and achieve a level that is on par with other OECD countries. According to the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)’s 2014-2018 country strategy for Chile, this will require better fostering innovation, globalizing domestic firms, taking better advantage of sources of power and water, and reducing inequality.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.29"
"4.571","Productivity and Competitiveness","","In 2017, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde warned that living standards around the world could be lowered if the rate of global productivity did not pick up. The following year, the IMF noted in its annual World Economic Outlook survey that a proliferation of new trade barriers only risked a further reduction in productivity, by slowing the spread of new technologies. Productivity levels are a key reason why different countries enjoy different degrees of prosperity; the world’s most competitive economies, such as the US and Germany, are three times more productive than emerging economies like Mexico or South Africa, for example, and seven times more productive than large developing countries like Nigeria, according to data published by the Conference Board. This at least partly explains why US GDP per capita is over $60,000, and Germany’s is over $50,000 - while Mexico’s remains at roughly $20,000, and Nigeria’s is about $6,000. While a decoupling between a country’s GDP growth and the benefits enjoyed by the workers in that country has occurred over the past few decades, when productivity levels reach a certain depth there is simply not enough income to properly distribute. As former US president Barack Obama put it, without a faster-growing economy, it is impossible to generate the wage gains people want - regardless of how wealth is divided. Global productivity has actually been decelerating since the early 2000’s. Between 1985 and 2000, productivity as measured by GDP per hour worked rose within Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries by nearly 41%; it then rose by just 19% between 2001 and 2016, according to OECD data. Following the global financial crisis, many countries actually experienced productivity declines, which in turn affected wages. According to the IMF, in economies where unemployment rates were below their historic averages before the so-called Great Recession that followed the financial crisis, slow productivity growth after the Great Recession accounted for nearly two-thirds of a slowdown in nominal wage growth that occurred at the same time. In order to secure prosperity, governments need to consider new ways to monitor the evolution of their productivity, which is complex and difficult to measure directly. The advent of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and associated technology developments have altered traditional aspects of productivity and their relative importance to economic development, only making accurate measurement even more difficult.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.58"
"4.572","Productivity in Latin America","","Between 1960 and 2017, countries in Latin America and the Caribbean invested the average equivalent of about 12% of their GDP into things like factories and machinery, only slightly behind the 13% of GDP spent on average in the rest of the world, according to a report published by the Inter-American Development Bank in 2018. However, Latin America’s total factor productivity, a measure of efficiency, actually declined by 0.11% during that same period (as it rose by 0.25% for the rest of the world), according to the report - pointing to the primary reason behind the region’s mediocre economic performance. Others include: financial market flaws, uneven taxation, poorly-enforced labour market regulations, inadequate or insufficient infrastructure, and other barriers to competition. Persistent skills gaps, gender inequality, and a relative lack of innovation have also played a role. According to the World Economic Forum’s 2018 Global Competitiveness Report, the region's economic recovery that started in 2017 remains fragile. According to the Forum’s report, specific risks for Latin America include growing trade protectionism on the part of the US, and the potential for a spillover of Venezuela's humanitarian and economic crisis. The region generally lags in terms of the adoption of information and communications technology, according to the report, with the exception of Uruguay (which topped countries including Switzerland and Taiwan","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.92"
"4.573","Promise of Precision Medicine","","Through the harnessing and analysing of genetic data, precision medicine promises to improve health outcomes and decrease costs. Precision medicine, also referred to as personalized medicine, could for example cut down on unnecessary costs tied to unnecessary and expensive diagnostic procedures. According to a report published in 2016 by healthcare software company Orion Health, 30% of our health is determined by our genome (all the genetic material in a cell), and the cost of sequencing a genome was expected to fall from $1,000 per person to $10 per person by 2020. Yet, the infrastructure required for using genomic sequencing to genuinely benefit patients remains embryonic. Issues yet to be adequately addressed include a lack of widespread availability of the necessary sequencing technology and attendant storage, of expertise required to use this new technology at the patient level, of the sufficient development of related economic models, and of evidence-based research that supports widespread adoption. There are serious ethical issues presented by the growing prevalence of precision medicine. The genomic and other biological data in a person’s medical record for the purposes of treatment could be misused, for example, and expose patients to privacy violations or worse. In addition, the genomic information in someone’s medical profile could also, theoretically, be used to subject that person to discrimination or make it difficult or impossible for him or her to obtain certain types of insurance. The so-called secondary use of a patient’s data for research purposes also raises the potential for privacy violations, without adequate safeguarding. Another significant potential ethical issue to consider is the impact of granting someone advance knowledge that they have an untreatable condition through the use of precision medicine - and thereby potentially hindering the person’s quality of life. Policy-makers and business leaders need to work together to develop responsible rules for the use of precision medicine, which is poised to become far more prevalent. Governments are investing significant amounts in related research and development; in China, for example, the government made precision medicine part of its five-year plan for 2016-2020, which should involve related investments worth more than $9 billion.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.71"
"4.574","Property Rights in Viet Nam","","The rights of ownership in Viet Nam, particularly those related to land, are not particularly secure. Although land users are technically given full rights, ultimately the government decides on land use and related financial matters. The relatively weak protection of property rights in the country is the source of land disputes that are occurring with greater frequency. According to a report published by the US Embassy in Viet Nam in 2017, the arrest and detention of people protesting land seizures had been a serious problem the previous year, and complaints and clashes related to the government confiscation of land to make way for infrastructure projects were prevalent. A survey conducted by the World Bank in 2014 found that land disputes accounted for as much as 80% of all complaints received every year by government agencies. Administrative distribution and conversion is a primary way for state-owned companies and well-connected private businesses to amass land at below-market prices; the lack of transparency when it comes to land acquisition and land use policies has therefore not only led to complaints, but also corruption. This has increased wealth inequality, and hindered sustainable development. Land holding restrictions have meanwhile contributed to the fragmentation of agricultural production, hampering productivity. Viet Nam had a relatively meagre 0.075 hectares of arable land per person as of 2015, compared with 0.211 hectares in Myanmar, and 0.229 in Thailand, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Bank. In order to try to overcome land fragmentation and expand production, many localities in the country have been concentrating land through focused land use policies, which have had some success in reducing transaction costs, and in improving both productivity and efficiency. However, in order to increase the land area available for large-scale commodity production, it is necessary to accelerate the accumulation of suitable agricultural land. In addition, in most localities, the land rental market has not sufficiently developed due to the relatively small size of available plots, and to high transaction costs.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.132"
"4.575","Public Awareness and Education","","Public awareness of the extent and nature of corruption, and of corruption’s impact, is crucial for generating the necessary political will to address the problem. Often, however, when it comes to corruption, the information environment is crowded and conflictual. The challenge is therefore to not merely communicate reliable information to the public, but to foster discernment and trust. A 2010 publication from the World Bank and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Building Public Support for Anti-Corruption Efforts: Why Anti-Corruption Agencies Need to Communicate and How, contains many still-relevant suggestions for how public anti-corruption agencies can work productively with independent media. However, the importance of social media platforms has increased since the publication appeared, and they have opened up new opportunities to communicate directly with people in order to improve their understanding of corruption. Often, ordinary citizens are remarkably good at distinguishing among news and information sources based on credibility. A 2016 paper published in the Journal of Politics, for example, found that the vast majority of Brazilians update their beliefs about corruption cautiously, and are able to evaluate information that comes from political parties differently than they evaluate more objective information that comes from a federal audit agency. Numerous studies have demonstrated the benefits of educating the public about the extent of corruption. Citizens in many countries have kicked corrupt incumbents out of positions of power in elections that follow well-publicized corruption scandals. Voters in Italy did so in response to the mani pulite (“clean hands”) scandal in the 1990s, while voters in the UK did so in reaction to the parliamentary expenses scandal that erupted in that country in 2009. In Brazil, this dynamic has been shown to be stronger in municipalities that have a radio station capable of facilitating the dissemination of information about what, exactly, the local mayor has done, for example. Countries are also incorporating discussions about corruption and integrity into school curricula. As of 2017, 34 countries had submitted reports on these activities to the United Nations’ Open-ended Intergovernmental Working Group on the Prevention of Corruption. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has meanwhile developed open-source educational materials on anti-corruption, ethics, and integrity; its Model Academic Course on the UN Convention Against Corruption is available in several languages, and is designed to be adapted to local contexts by university lecturers.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.37"
"4.576","Public Governance in Viet Nam","","Corruption constrains healthy economic activity, and kills dynamism. However, Viet Nam’s institutional fragmentation - the diffusion of authority, decision-making and supervision among central and regional government officials - has rendered anti-corruption efforts in the country largely ineffective. One example of this fragmentation: virtually all of the provinces along Viet Nam’s coast have sought to push plans forward to build sea ports, and many localities want to build new airports, regardless of the relative proximity of these planned projects or their expected overall benefit to national economic development. According to Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index for 2017, where a score of 100 means very clean and zero is equal to deep-rooted, systemic corruption, Viet Nam scored a 35 - a slight improvement from its score of 33 in the previous year. A report published in 2017 by Transparency International and the non-profit organization Towards Transparency cited positive signs for the country including recent anti-corruption efforts made by the government; in 2016, for example, the government passed the Law on Access to Information, which guarantees equal access to information from state agencies. Yet, the report also cited survey results showing that 58% of respondents felt that corruption levels had increased during the past year, while more than half believed the police are highly corrupt, nearly half believed tax officials are highly corrupt, and 32% believed government officials are highly corrupt. For the ruling Communist Party, implementing institutional reforms is difficult, as they can affect the interests of both incumbent leaders and retired elites. The party must strike the right balance between its own authority, and the country’s economic performance, in order to maintain its legitimacy. Meanwhile public pressure is needed in order to push difficult institutional reforms forward, and increase both transparency and accountability. The news media in Viet Nam is increasingly using online social networks to gather information and push democratization in the country forward - potentially changing the government from one that commands, to one that enables.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.132"
"4.577","Public Perception","","Improving the public's understanding of the industry continues to be a challenge for the chemical and materials sector. More favourable public perception is necessary if the industry is going to be able to successfully advance new technologies and products. Improved perception could help drive early development and technologies to commercialization, and nurture the systems needed to better foster innovation. Negative perception meanwhile threatens to dramatically delay or interrupt development, while potentially ill-informed regulation can create significant business risk that can quickly morph into broader economic and social risk. Consumers are demanding greater amounts of information about the manufacturing processes behind the products they buy, which has prompted a need for the sector to describe its processes using clearer and more accessible language. People also expect at least a certain degree of social and environmental responsibility, and both intentional and accidental transgressions by companies are now subject to greater scrutiny. The power of social media is at anyone’s fingertips, and mass media covering the industry can potentially be ill-informed. Published stories have in the past contributed to a slanted view of the sector and of its potential global benefit. The industry in general needs to make greater efforts to improve public communication about its contributions to sustainability, and about its historic contributions to many peoples' relatively high standards of living. Otherwise, it risks a pervasive lack of interest from young people headed towards careers in science and technology, a lack of skilled employees needed to move the sector forward, and most importantly, a lack of public trust and partnerships needed to help solve some of the world’s greatest challenges.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.28"

Causes of the crisis included poorly designed incentive systems at these financial firms, inadequate or unenforced fiduciary standards, lax corporate governance, and weak internal controls - in addition to unethical and illegal activity. A seemingly endless flow of legal probes and large fines in the wake of the crisis has only reinforced negative public sentiment. This has been costly for both the reputations of banks, and for society in general; now, the average household may be reluctant to participate in the financial system, absent additional government guarantees. The 2018 Edelman Trust Barometer, based on an online survey conducted in 28 countries in late 2017, showed that financial services ranked among the least trusted industry sectors (alongside automotive and consumer packaged goods), with 54% of respondents expressing trust in the sector. The figure showed no improvement from the prior year’s barometer, which also reflected a 54% trust level in financial services. By way of comparison, 75% of respondents expressed trust in the technology industry, according to the barometer.  Significant pressure has been placed on governments post-crisis to more strictly regulate financial entities, in the hope of avoiding a repeat. The risk here is that we spawn a regressive, over-regulated financial system; it is important that governments work together with financial firms to find the right way forward. A lingering lack of trust in banks can negatively affect an economy’s long-term development, and there have been efforts to simply shift financial systems away from an over-reliance on banks. For example, the European Union’s Capital Markets Union action plan, launched in 2015, aims to improve risk-sharing by diversifying financing sources beyond the banking system. According to a report published by the consultancy PwC in 2014, trust in banks was at an all-time low. As a result, the report projected that by 2020, retail banks would begin organizing themselves around customers, rather than products, that they would evolve their customer experience to become more female-friendly, and that they would view social media (rather than traditional media) as the primary means for connecting with customers and providing information about offerings. Paramount for rebuilding trust, according to the report, will be a greater focus among retail banks on cyber security.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.18"
"4.580","Public-Private Collaboration","","Public sector funders of development projects, and private sector investors, have traditionally operated in parallel - as each tries to achieve their own, distinct objectives. Unfortunately, in relatively complex, emerging and frontier markets, neither public capital aimed at development, nor private capital driven by returns, has been able to efficiently realize respective objectives. This has limited economic growth, and led to missed investment opportunities. While there is a projected $94 trillion in global infrastructure investment need between 2007 and 2040, we are currently only on track to make $79 trillion in necessary investment, according to the Global Infrastructure Hub, an organization started by the G20. Globally, according to the organization, infrastructure funding gaps range from about $526 billion in India, to $1.2 trillion in Brazil, and $3.8 trillion in the US. On a proportional basis, which takes into account a region’s specific economic characteristics, areas faced with the most acute funding gaps are developing countries like Guinea, Cote D’Ivoire, and Ghana, according to a report published in 2018 by the Global Infrastructure Hub and Oxford Economics. Guinea, for example, has a projected need for investment that is more than 80% greater than what is being spent under current trends, according to the report. Blended Finance is an increasingly prevalent mechanism used to address such shortfalls; it uses multi-stakeholder collaboration to better align the interests of public and private investors, and ensure the credibility, reputation, and positive impact of development projects in emerging and frontier markets. While public institutions can leverage their connections to assume specific risks, private capital providers generally bring with them structuring expertise and an ability to fast track the delivery of projects with significant development impact.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.23"
"4.581","Public-Private Cooperation for the Bioeconomy","","The cost of unchecked biodiversity loss on ecosystem services (like climate control and pollination) may reach $14 trillion annually by 2050, an amount equal to nearly one-fifth of current global GDP, according to some estimates. The strong economic case for conserving biodiversity is spurring related investment in research and development, subsidies for more sustainable practices, and the setting of aspirational targets. Many countries, even those with legacies of unsustainable fossil fuel use, can reduce related risk by making public procurement commitments to sustainable, bio-based products, and by strengthening related intellectual property rights enforcement. Governments are often reluctant to apply strict regulations, and instead prefer voluntary certification schemes - essentially ceding leadership to the private sector. Yet, while private landowners have been incentivized to practice more sustainable cultivation, their ability to focus on locally-relevant species could be enhanced by greater support from local authorities (and by greater investment in technical capacity). Government-established markets like biodiversity banks, for example, enable landowners to earn conservation credits for enhancing ecological value - which can ultimately be sold to land developers. However, such trade-off schemes allow for “less bad” outcomes that still result in net biodiversity losses. Several countries (and companies) are now moving towards requirements for “Biodiversity Net Gain,” or ensuring that biodiversity health improves after development. The United Kingdom, for example, opted in 2019 to make Biodiversity Net Gain mandatory. Businesses and business coalitions (such as those mobilized by We Mean Business, a non-profit group that aims for a zero-carbon economy) have meanwhile encouraged governments to set climate change-related targets. A society-wide push for change, co-led by private organizations and individuals, can enable companies to focus on adapting to a new climate reality even as they seek to boost profits and operational efficiency. Currently, there is no single global target for biodiversity conservation. However, there are 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets, established in 2010 under the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, which encourage individual governments to hit goals by 2020 - including the creation of biodiversity action plans, and ensuring adequate conservation areas. According to a report published by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services in 2019, “good” progress had been made on just four of the 20 targets, however. Better public-private co-operation is therefore essential to ensure a sustainable bioeconomy.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.21"
"4.582","Pushing Ahead in the 4IR","","Thanks to significant investments in technology, and to innovation-enabling policies, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has become a leading technology hub in the Middle East and North Africa region - and is relatively well-positioned to embrace the opportunities of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Non-oil revenue for the UAE government climbed to nearly 21% of the total by 2018, from 13% in 2008, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, and technology and innovation are critical for the country as it seeks to further shift away from oil dependence. The country’s tech sector could be a powerful engine of growth that expands employment opportunities, which is particularly important in light of an expanding youth demographic, and significant youth unemployment throughout the region. The World Economic Forum’s 2018 Global Competitiveness Index ranked the UAE 33rd out of 140 economies in terms of its “innovation ecosystem,” and 12th in terms of the growth of innovative companies - ahead of both Japan and Ireland. The UAE has unveiled a national strategy for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, in order to help it better take advantage of related opportunities; it has appointed the world’s first government minister for artificial intelligence, and aims to have half of all government transactions conducted using blockchain by 2021. The UAE boasts an active startup scene that accounts for about one third of the region’s total startup investment. Government-funded incubators and accelerators, regulatory sandboxes, and technology parks and tax free zones are attracting foreign talent and helping to nurture entrepreneurship. The UAE has also attracted academics from abroad to bolster local development; the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, for example, has consulted on the development of Masdar City in Abu Dhabi, which is designed to run on renewable energy sources and to serve as a hub for green technology companies. While the UAE has become an attractive destination for many investors and entrepreneurs, it is not without challenges. A number of regulatory barriers exist, such as a ban on free, voice over internet protocol (VoIP) services like Skype, which can make opening and running a startup difficult. In addition, the Middle East region suffers from a relatively high rate of cyberattacks, according to Kaspersky Lab’s Cyberthreat Real-Time Map (the UAE is the 17th-most attacked country in the world, according to the map), prompting a need for a greater focus on security.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.128"
"4.583","Quality Basic Education","","Around the world, educational provision remains uneven. Most countries are able to provide adequate primary education, but many struggle with increasing its quality. In addition, many places struggle to provide appropriate secondary (high school or its equivalent) education. The quality and breadth of educational provision are particularly concerning in sub-Saharan Africa, and deeply uneven in the Middle East, North Africa, and in parts of Southeast Asia, according to the World Economic Forum’s 2017 Global Human Capital Report. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) found in a 2016 report that more than 263 million children and young people between the ages of six and 17 are not attending school worldwide. Meanwhile inequality in education is increasing, particularly among the poorest and most disadvantaged. While nearly two-thirds of all countries have attained gender parity in primary education, girls are still less likely than boys to start secondary education. Basic education should provide a broad foundation for future learning and re-skilling. Unequal access to education leads to unequal access to opportunity and can permanently hinder students’ potential to learn new skills in the future. As well as providing access to education, concerted efforts will be needed to improve the quality of basic education worldwide. This can be addressed in part by introducing clear, recognized global standards that benchmark measurable learning outcomes. The cost of providing basic education is a persistent barrier that contributes to unequal provision. According to UNESCO’s final review of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals in 2015, an additional $22 billion in funding is needed - every year - in order to meet basic education targets for 2030. This gap demonstrates that there is an acute need for new financing models, particularly in developing countries. Technological innovation could be one possible way to address the issue.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.43"
"4.584","Quality of Russian Institutions","","As the Russian Federation seeks to become an advanced, industrialized economy, it has an opportunity to drive growth through the improvement of its institutions. Despite increased government spending, the quality of the country’s health, education and other infrastructure has stagnated. The ways in which the government addresses, or fails to address, barriers to growth posed by red tape will profoundly impact the Russian Federation’s economic development. Leadership style plays a significant role in both the public sector (at both federal and regional levels), and in the country’s private sector. How its leaders reconcile their short- and long-term priorities will affect the country’s future direction. The Russian Federation ranked 83rd out of 137 economies in terms of its institutions, according to the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index 2017-2018; the country ranked 116th specifically in terms of property rights, according to the index, and corruption was cited as the most problematic factor for doing business there. Inefficient or ambiguous bureaucratic processes can increase transaction costs at every stage of commercial development, from opening a business to fulfilling customs procedures. Uncertainty about the enforcement of regulations and the protection of property rights has an equally paralysing effect. Due to the country’s institutional unpredictability, much of the capital that flows into the economy via energy revenue is not retained and put to productive use. Capital flight, or the flow of money out of the country due to political or economic anxieties, has been a continuous problem. However, in the World Bank’s annual ratings for doing business, Russia improved to 35th place in 2017 from 40th in 2016, as it adopted three key business reforms intended to improve its investment climate and create jobs. Access to credit was strengthened by the adoption of a law meant to improve the collateral registry system, while cross-border trade was facilitated by the opening of a new deepwater port on the coast of the Gulf of Finland, as an alternative to the Port of St. Petersburg, and registering property was potentially made easier by decreasing the time required to apply for title transfers. Further development of the country’s institutions represents a significant economic opportunity. Local governments within the Russian Federation are generally more supportive of private business than federal institutions. Competition among the regions for private investment may further increase that divergence in the future, particularly if federal government funding for the regions declines.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.116"
"4.585","Race and Inequality in America","","The US ranked first in the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index for 2018, thanks largely to its entrepreneurial culture. But the Forum’s full competitiveness report published that year told a more nuanced story. According to the report, the percentage of all income going to the richest 1% of people in the US more than doubled in the past few decades (to about 20%), while the share going to the middle class fell. Growing wealth inequality threatens to aggravate a long-standing racial divide; according to the Institute for Policy Studies, the median black family in America saw their wealth decrease by more than half between 1983 and 2016, while the wealth for median white households increased by 33% over the same period; if the recent trajectory continues, by 2050 the median white family in the US will have $174,000 in wealth, compared with $600 for the median black family (and $8,600 for the median Latino family). Inequality can also mean unequal access to health care; the US placed behind most advanced economies on the Health pillar of the Forum’s index, and in terms of healthy life expectancy the country ranked behind Sri Lanka and China.       While America’s institutional framework remains strong, according to the Forum’s competitiveness report, a weakening social fabric and a deteriorating security situation have taken their toll. The country has a homicide rate five times the average for advanced economies, according to the report. Meanwhile lingering race-based division threatens to limit the benefits of America's economic progress, according to a paper published in 2018 by the Hamilton Project - which illustrates the ways that black populations tend to remain not only in regions that suffer from relatively low income levels, but also statistically lower odds of upward economic mobility. Race has also played a role in efforts to undermine democracy in the country. Russia’s Internet Research Agency has launched an ongoing attack on the US by spreading online propaganda that is targeted to specific racial and ethnic groups, and is intended to misinform and polarize voters, according to a report published in late 2018 by the University of Oxford and the research firm Graphika. The Russian agency’s efforts have included Facebook messages with a race-based appeal that refer to immigrants as “parasites,” and convey anti-refugee and anti-Muslim sentiments, according to the report.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.130"
"4.586","Radicalization and Violent Extremism","","Violent extremism emanating from the Middle East and North Africa shook the world when the Islamic State, or ISIS, took control of territory equal to the size of Britain in 2014 and launched a terror campaign marked by the slaughter of religious and ethnic minorities and the destruction of historic sites in Iraq and Syria. At its peak, ISIS had an estimated 40,000 recruits from 100 countries, and considerable oil resources. However, after the group lost the cities of Raqqa and Mosul in 2017, the Syrian Democratic Forces declared the territorial defeat of ISIS in the eastern Syrian town of Baghouz in early 2019 - though not without sending the world a warning about its continued ideological and financial strength. ISIS’s ideology and propaganda enabled it to flourish in a region increasingly defined by social polarization and disaffected youth. Though it has lost control of territory, more needs to be done to prevent its resurgence. A systemic approach that addresses the root causes of its emergence is needed, as is a sustainable process of reconstruction that focuses not only on economic recovery but also on mending the social fabric. Violent extremist groups have generally been able to thrive by harnessing communication platforms and social media in ways that outpace traditional policy and community responses. It is difficult, if not impossible, to control the digital space as a tool for recruitment and radicalization; an entire generation of digital natives is engaging with extremist worldviews via just a few clicks. Terrorist cells inspired by ISIS’s message have wreaked havoc around the world, striking twice in Paris in 2015, then in Brussels, Orlando, Nice and Berlin in 2016, and in Manchester, London and Barcelona in 2017. Also in 2017, Russia’s FSB announced it had arrested suspected followers of ISIS for plotting terror attacks in St. Petersburg, and in 2019 ISIS claimed responsibility for suicide bombings in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday that killed more than 350 people. There is an urgent need to understand the mind-set and motivation behind such attacks, in order to pre-empt violent extremism, save lives, and prevent further economic impact. According to the 2018 Global Terrorism Index published by the Institute for Economics & Peace, the global economic impact of terrorism in 2017 declined by 42% compared with the prior year - but still totalled $52 billion.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.97"
"4.587","Real Estate Finance","","The real estate sector is intimately intertwined with the development of financial and capital markets. In addition to the large volume of plain-vanilla transactions in the global real estate market, there are an increasing number of innovations when it comes to real estate financing, investment and risk mitigation. Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), or firms that provide investors with ways to tap into real estate-related revenue, derivative financial instruments, and public-private partnerships, are enabling new funding sources for the industry while making it possible for mom and pop investors to buy into property portfolios and diversify their wealth. In addition, they are providing access to new sources of capital for corporations. As of 2018, global REIT market capitalization had reached $1.7 trillion, a 7% increase over the prior year, according to a report published by the consultancy EY. In addition to structures like REITs, the growth of financial technology, or fintech, has also encouraged greater real estate finance-related innovation and entrepreneurship. Between 2008 and 2017 cumulative investment in real estate fintech startups rose to more than $31 billion from about $2 billion, according to a report published by Deloitte. While fintech, crowdfunding, peer-to-peer lending, and venture capital are not new concepts for the real estate industry, they can all be used in new and innovative ways to facilitate the evolution of a more efficient market.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.112"
"4.588","Real Estate Regulation and Governance","","In the real estate world, regulation that can adequately protect against spiralling asset prices is imperative to ensure that financial bubbles do not have wider, systemic implications. According to a report published by the Swiss bank UBS, the cities at greatest risk of real estate price bubbles as of 2018 were Amsterdam, Hong Kong, London, Munich, Toronto, and Vancouver. Global house prices increased by 35% between 2008 and 2018, according to the report, and buying a 60-square-metre in most cities now exceeds the budget of most people who earn an average salary in the highly-skilled service sector. The pace of transformation in the real estate market, spurred by technology innovation, may necessitate a fine-tuning of rules that require firms to minimize the risk of collapse - in order to ensure continued stability for the broader financial system. Measures such as limiting, or lowering, loan-to-value ratios in order to potentially reduce costs, placing caps on the amount of time required to repay loans, increasing capital gains taxes that apply when properties are sold, and limiting the purchase of multiple properties for investment and speculation could be some of the speed-bumps used to slow the growth of a bubble. Apart from the real estate market, the strengthening of the stability of banks’ balance sheets is also important for alleviating fears of another financial contagion more than a decade after the real estate-related subprime mortgage crisis in the US spurred widespread recession and unemployment.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.112"
"4.589","Reaping Africa’s Dividend","","Africa has yet to experience the kind of demographic transition that injected large numbers of people into the workforce in East Asia and fuelled both corresponding economic growth in that region, and increased investment in education. In Africa, a combination of education- and skills-related challenges have so far resulted in what could be regarded as demographic headwinds (growing populations, but stagnant workforces). However, a demographic dividend on the continent, where 30% of an expected population of 3 billion people by 2065 should be between 15- and 24-years-old, could yet result in an additional $500 billion in annual economic growth over a 30-year period - which in turn could empower women, improve health, and bolster education (particularly for young girls), according to a report published by Agence Française de Développement in 2017. But in order to realize this demographic dividend, sub-Saharan Africa will have to create an average of 18 million high-productivity jobs a year until 2035 - six times the current rate of job creation of 3 million jobs a year. While a demographic dividend is within reach for Africa, it has been slow in coming. A few countries (such as Tunisia) have made strides by reducing fertility rates as their working-age populations grow, though others are stuck with relatively high fertility. And while a 1% increase in the working age population in Africa can result in a 1.4% increase in GDP, female labour force participation has been blunted by childcare responsibilities - and related policy support is required. In addition, while relatively well-educated people from wealthier African countries tend to migrate overseas, migration within Africa has largely been informal and not captured by legitimate economic sectors, according to a report published by the Brookings Institution in 2018. In order to create a sufficient number of productive jobs, sustained annual economic growth of 8% to 9% is required, and policy-makers should focus on sectors including agriculture and agro-processing, wholesale and retail trade, and tourism - based on their current growth rates and multiplier effects. Ultimately, the inclusive growth required to reap a demographic dividend calls for the transformation of Africa’s economies - and a sustained focus on family planning.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.6"
"4.590","Recognizing India’s Urban Future","","While the idea that India lives in its villages is accepted wisdom that shapes public policy, it is not necessarily true. It also masks real policy challenges related to managing Indian urbanization, and governing the cities that generate up to 70% of the country’s GDP. Countries define urban settlements in different ways. India, per the 2011 census, is 31% urban. According to other definitions, the country is 26% urban. Both estimates may well be off by a fair distance. India’s human capital and growth targets fall into a chasm between “official” and true urbanization. While Rural Local Bodies (RLBs) govern areas classified as rural, Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) that govern urban areas have different powers under the Constitution. For example, ULBs are mandated to provide goods such as sewage lines and arterial roads, while RLBs are not. This means that areas that are officially classified as rural, but have the density of urban settlements, do not receive critical amenities. Physical infrastructure such as roads and water supply is only one part of this equation - people living in areas governed by ULBs are also significantly more likely to be able to access education and healthcare.  This sort of disparity affects about 250 million people, and has wide-ranging implications for both India’s health burden and costs, and the quality of its labour force. There are worrying fiscal implications, too. The share of tax revenue raised by ULBs is estimated to be 8.5 times higher than that of RLBs, even though RLBs preside over roughly three times the number of people. The Indian state is already stretched for resources needed to improve infrastructure, and by failing to recognize (real) urbanization it is further depriving itself. People migrate to cities seeking jobs and other opportunities - and well-functioning and diverse cities give rise to beneficial, “agglomeration” economies that drive productivity and growth. Poorly-run cities, however, have their agglomeration economies undercut by rising congestion, worsening air quality, soaring house prices, and inadequate public services - and more often than not, Indian cities fall into this category, as ULBs spend only about 28% of what they need for the efficient delivery and management of services. Acknowledging the extent of India’s urbanization, and effectively managing it by reforming urban governance are key for improving the country’s quality of life and human capital, while boosting economic growth.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.77"
"4.591","Reconciliation and Development","","Since the end of a decades-long war with Tamil Tiger separatists in 2009, Sri Lanka has made gradual progress on post-conflict reconciliation. Meaningful reconciliation, however, requires that economic and political power be restored to people in former conflict zones in the north and east of the country. Prior to the presidential election in 2015, the government’s focus had been on heavy capital expenditure, with a preference for large infrastructure projects. This was motivated by a need to improve transportation connections between former conflict areas and the rest of the country. However, infrastructure building, in the absence of economic and political empowerment, did not translate into sustainable reconciliation. Faced with international backlash over alleged human rights violations committed by the Sri Lankan army during the last stages of the civil war, Sri Lanka’s government lost preferential concessions granted by the European Union to developing countries, and had to turn to China for the financing required to back its infrastructure investment. Following the 2015 elections, however, the government made a fresh commitment to accountability and reconciliation measures. Considerations have since been made about restoring land rights, demilitarization, and investigating allegations made against the army - though progress has been impeded by flareups of violence. The country has more recently dealt with violent extremism without apparent connection to its historic ethnic strife; the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the suicide bombings of churches and hotels on Easter Sunday 2019 that killed more than 350 people. During the civil war, areas of the north and east in Sri Lanka enjoyed minimal economic growth and received little to no investment. Amid early post-conflict resettlement and infrastructure development efforts, the government came under heavy scrutiny for the militarization of these former conflict zones, and for the appropriation of minority-owned land. This contributed to ethnic tension, and reconciliation stagnated. The government must now revitalize the process. The Office for National Unity and Reconciliation, established in 2015, has been tasked with formulating related policies and programmes. The passage of the Right to Information Act of 2016, which grants citizens a right to know how public money is being spent, and the establishment of an Office of Missing Persons in 2017, were considered positives for reconciliation - though progress has been hindered by populist nationalist sentiment and sporadic ethnic tensions.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.121"
"4.592","Redefining Health and Disease","","Nosology, the medicinal science that deals with the classification of disease, is embracing the technological revolution of omics: the fields that end in “-omics.” Genomics, for example, is emerging as a powerful tool that can be used in the classification of disease, and builds on previous technological advances that utilized anatomy and microbiology to define pathologic disease. Genomic information (about an individual’s genetic makeup) can enable us to categorize disease, understand pathology, and target treatment accordingly. Knowledge of each person’s unique DNA sequence is bound to further personalize healthcare and treatment decisions. With advances in genomic science, ailments that once seemed dissimilar are being joined together under a single focus. And, what were once thought to be uniform diseases are being differentiated. For example, we can now define cancer based on aberrant genomic signatures, rather than simply on the anatomical origin of a tumour. Another example: cystic fibrosis can result from more than 900 mutations in the CTFR gene, and a drug has been developed that is particularly effective at addressing a specific, cystic fibrosis-related mutation. Rapid and relatively inexpensive genome sequencing, along with bioinformatics tools, are driving the new Personalized Medicine paradigm. The challenge will be to efficiently incorporate this genomic information into routine healthcare.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.109"
"4.593","Refugees and Migration","","If all of the people now living outside of the country of their birth united to form their own state, it would have a population of more than 240 million - making it the fifth-largest country in the world, according to the United Nations International Migration Report 2015. Migration is a defining topic of our time, and the countries that succeed in harnessing its potential by attracting the best and brightest, or by utilizing diasporas to advance their foreign interests, can benefit tremendously. However, the migration crisis in Europe has challenged solidarity and cohesion. The European Union has shown it is unable to take advantage of migration flows, and has instead on several occasions become vulnerable to foreign threats to control refugee and migrant flows to advance political ends; examples include former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi’s 2010 threat that Europe would “turn black” if he did not receive aid to help stop the flow of migrants from Africa, or Turkey’s role in the current migrant crisis.  EU members generally do not see themselves as immigration countries, despite the fact that as of 2015 more than 10% of marriages in the bloc involved at least one foreigner, according to Eurostat figures. This mentality influenced their stance during the migrant crisis in 2015, when about 1 million refugees, predominantly from Syria and Afghanistan as well as from sub-Saharan African countries, made their way into the EU, according to United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees data. Germany unilaterally decided in 2015 to open its borders and take in the majority of refugees seeking to make a new home there; at least 700,000 refugees arrived before the end of that year, according to the German Federal Office for Migration and Refugees, putting a strain on resources. Germany’s move frustrated European leaders who interpreted it as disregarding their own wishes, and coming at their expense. Resistance formed in particular in eastern member states, where many accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government of enticing foreigners to prop up an ageing German society. Though migrant numbers have fallen, Europe must still reconcile calls for anti-immigrant policies and closed borders in mainstream politics with the practical necessity of embracing newcomers. Despite concerted efforts, reaching a comprehensive, durable accord on migration within the EU seems unlikely. One point of agreement, however, is that it is best to help people to not have to become migrants in the first place.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.50"
"4.594","Regional Cooperation","","After four years of downturn, 2017 marked a recovery for exports from Latin America and the Caribbean - their value rose by 12.2% compared with the prior year, and then proceeded to grow by 9.9% in 2018. However, the Inter-American Development Bank’s Trade and Integration Monitor 2018 warned that the region is vulnerable to the instability of external demand, the appreciation of the dollar, and the effects of global trade tensions; this vulnerability is made particularly acute by the relatively low sophistication (a measure of technical and other characteristics) of Latin American exports. In addition, Latin America has actually lost export market share within the region itself - especially in more sophisticated sectors - due to a lag in competitiveness relative to global rivals. This points to an urgent need for the region to adopt policies that better promote the quality of exports and to focus on improving regional trade integration.  Since the mid-1990s, trade barriers have been significantly reduced between Latin American and Caribbean nations. Of the 284 physical regional trade agreements currently in effect worldwide, 57 include South American countries, and 38 include Central American countries - resulting in trade agreement coverage of more than 80% of all trade in Latin America and the Caribbean, according to World Trade Organization figures. Latin American countries have made some progress in harmonizing their cross-border integration procedures and regulation. However, as global competition increases and global value chains grow in complexity, better alignment of national policies and a revamping of institutions will be vital to promote the quality, sophistication, and compatibility of the region’s exports. Transport and logistics costs constitute one of the most significant obstacles to trade integration. According to the Latin American Integration Association, these costs are significantly higher in the region than those in the developed world as a consequence of limited and relatively inefficient infrastructure.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.92"
"4.595","Regional Cooperation in Africa","","It is now widely accepted both that the earth’s climate is changing, and that Africa is the most negatively impacted continent on the planet - mainly due to high vulnerability levels, low adaptive capacities, and widespread poverty. Even as Africa bears the brunt of climate change impact, it contributes the smallest share among all continents to the global greenhouse gas emissions (3.8% of global emissions, compared with 23% for China), according to a report published by the Brookings Institution in 2016. As a result of climate change, by the year 2020 as many as 250 million people in Africa are expected to be exposed to increased water stress, and yields from rainfed agriculture could be reduced by up to 50%, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. In light of these challenges, cooperation among countries in the region could be an effective tool to bolster and share in economic development. Cooperation between African countries is currently underpinned by the African Union’s eight Regional Economic Communities (including Arab Maghreb Union in the north, and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development in the east). However, there are other regional organizations in Africa that deal with public goods like infrastructure; five are concerned with energy, 15 with rivers and lakes, three with peace and security, and one with the environment. When it comes to the environment, cooperation has been perceived as inadequate - which is unfortunate. According to a 2017 paper published in the International Journal of Climate Change Strategies and Management, regional efforts are at least eight times more effective than individual country approaches when it comes to developing responses to climate change (while international cooperation is 3.9 times more effective). On the other hand, cooperation among African countries focused on infrastructure has improved. The African Infrastructure Development Index reflected improved scores for virtually all countries in 2018, and the continent as a whole saw its score rise to 28.44 from 27.12 in 2016. Above all, there is a need for a more concerted, holistic, continent-wide approach to addressing climate change, particularly in relation to food security, safety, and the protection of water resources, in order to help stem related impacts, scarcity, and mounting illegal migration to Europe.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.6"
"4.596","Regional Digital Economy","","The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region is home to about 640 million people, and more than half are both under the age of 30 and relatively tech savvy. In a report published in late 2017, Google and Temasek (Singapore’s state-owned investment firm) noted that the growth of the internet economy in Southeast Asia had exceeded expectations, having reached $50 billion in size that year while remaining well on track to reach $200 billion by 2025. The region added more than 70 million new internet users between 2015 and 2017, according to the report, and its population was already spending more time on the mobile internet than anywhere else in the world; Thailand topped the list of countries by time spent, at 4.2 hours per day, while Indonesia registered 3.9 hours per day. By way of comparison, time spent in the US was just 2 hours per day, while in the United Kingdom it was 1.8 hours, according to the report. In combination with the transformative impact of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, these trends have the potential to help stimulate new industries, leapfrog legacy business models, and fundamentally change lives. Digital trade can better connect the ASEAN region’s small- and medium-sized enterprises to regional and global markets, while the emergence of digital capabilities such as finance tools tied to blockchain technology could enable further opportunities for these firms. That in turn could make the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) trade bloc more vibrant and inclusive. One good example of the impact that digital trade can have on regional economic growth is the low-cost airline Air Asia, which has deployed digital tools to enable it to sell cheap tickets and boost operational efficiency. A number of ambitious internet firms have emerged in the region, such as Singapore-based online retailer Lazada, which sold a controlling stake to Chinese internet giant Alibaba in 2016 for $1 billion; in 2018, Alibaba invested a further $3 billion in the firm, in order to bolster the relationship. However, technology adoption differs greatly among ASEAN countries, and there is a need to build regional internet infrastructure. In order to attract the necessary investment for this, easing the flow of data across national borders and taking steps to bolster cyber security are essential.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.2"
"4.597","Regional Economic Context","","Annual GDP growth in the Middle East and North Africa region is projected to rebound to an average of 2% in 2018 (up from 1.4% the prior year), and is on track to improve to 2.8% by the end of 2020, according to the World Bank. The rebound is mostly attributed to the recent uptick in oil prices, which has benefited the region’s exporters. In order to better realize the economic potential of this part of the world, a credible reform agenda for inclusive growth is vital - one that addresses access to financing for small businesses, the removal of trade barriers, and the free movement of labour and capital. Measures to bolster industry and improve competitiveness have already generated results in Egypt, for example, which has moved up in the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index ranking between 2015 (116th out of 140 economies) and 2018 (94th out of 140). While Egypt has dealt with significant public debt and inflationary pressure, its government has sought to stimulate private sector investment in energy, infrastructure, and transportation (while implementing reforms including exchange-rate liberalization, and energy subsidy reductions). By way of contrast, Jordan, which has implemented a “Vision 2025” program to try to improve its competitiveness, has actually slipped lower in the Forum’s index - to 73rd place in 2018, from 64th in 2015. Meanwhile ongoing conflict in countries like Iraq, Libya, Syria, and Yemen is having a negative effect on infrastructure and local economic health. While the oil-rich countries in the Gulf have enjoyed growth and macroeconomic stability, they also face problems with unemployment and a mismatch between current labour force skills and the skills actually needed by employers. Uncertainty about efforts to shift away from oil dependency in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries (the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia) has affected their competitiveness to varying degrees; while a decline in oil prices had led Kuwait to experience its first budget deficit in 2016 following 16 consecutive years of surplus, prices recovered in 2018. Despite the fragmented competitiveness landscape, the two non-oil-related industries in the region that are growing across the board are healthcare and education.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.97"
"4.598","Regional Relationships","","The Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) was formed in 1967, with an agreement among five original founding nations (Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand) to organize for the sake of peace, stability and cooperation. The group provided an important means to push back against the constraints of the then-bipolar world order that resulted from the Cold War. ASEAN added Brunei Darussalam in 1984, Viet Nam in 1995, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (or Laos) and Myanmar in 1997, and Cambodia in 1999. Currently, Timor-Leste (or East Timor) is forging closer ties with ASEAN and hoping to join the bloc. ASEAN has sought to better ensure regional security with efforts such as a 1997 treaty banning nuclear weapons, and the region is located at a strategically important junction between two of the world’s most populous rising economic powers, China and India, making it a geopolitical and geo-economic focal point. All ASEAN member states have now signed the founding document for the China-backed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which was established in 2015 to provide both an alternative to Western-led efforts such as the World Bank, and regional competition for the Japanese-led Asian Development Bank. India, meanwhile, changed its longstanding “Look East” policy in 2014 to an “Act East” policy, by engaging ASEAN member Myanmar as a possible bulwark against Chinese influence. ASEAN member states are also enmeshed in territorial disputes with interested powers. China’s claim to territories in the South China Sea, for example, overlaps with competing claims by Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Viet Nam. A 2015 Centre for Strategic & International Studies report noted that ASEAN members generally respond to challenges with a united front, though individual national interest can still take precedence - as is the case with the South China Sea dispute, the most serious geopolitical issue in the region. This tension between unity and national interest can be attributed in part to the broad spectrum of linguistic and religious traditions within ASEAN, home to Muslims, Christians, Buddhists, Hindus and followers of other religions. It can also be viewed as a natural growing pain for formerly-colonized countries working to forge their own strong political institutions.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.2"
"4.599","Regulation and Circularity","","Governments have started to stimulate and reward the adoption of circular business models, which emphasize the reuse of materials in order to eliminate waste. Japan, in particular, has distinguished itself in this regard; in 2000, the Japanese government passed the Law for the Promotion of Efficient Utilization of Resources, which requires businesses to cut their generation of by-products and encourages them to use recyclable resources (Japanese manufacturers are also required to run disassembly plants, and to recover material). In 2001, the Chinese Government began turning its industrial parks into eco-industrial parks, by incentivizing practices such as industrial symbiosis - where by-products from one factory can be used by another. Examples include a paper plant that receives its wood supply from a lumber mill, and in turn supplies sludge for use in fertilizer. In 2008, China adopted its Circular Economy Promotion Law, to support more effective use of resources. The European Commission has meanwhile adopted a “Circular Economy Package,” which includes proposals such as a common European Union target for recycling 65% of all municipal waste, and 75% of all packaging waste, by 2030. International policy agendas are also increasingly taking the circular economy into account. The International Resource Panel, consisting of scientists and hosted by the United Nations Environment Programme, was founded in 2007 to provide advice on natural resources, sustainability, and production, and to help separate economic growth from accompanying environmental degradation. According to the panel, institutions that have made use of its work include the European Commission and the African Development Bank. In 2015, the leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) countries formed an Alliance on Resource Efficiency, as a platform for knowledge-sharing about reducing environmental pollution. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, which went into effect in 2016 to guide UN Development Program policy and funding, include a specific call (goal 12) for responsible consumption and production; at the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development held in New York in 2018, progress made to date on goal 12 was reviewed, and speakers including the European Union and France advocated for a circular economy approach to the issue, while Belgium and Estonia presented their plans for their countries to become circular economies.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.31"
"4.600","Regulation and Corporate Adaptation","","A wide variety of legal and regulatory environments have been constructed around the world; the OECD Corporate Governance Factbook contains information about nearly 50 different national institutional, legal, and regulatory frameworks. Some institutional and legal settings have proven to be more conducive to effective corporate governance than others. Enhancing governance reform in the many places where it is lacking is a potential source of value creation both for individual companies and broader economies. One example of legal governance reform is 2002’s Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the US, which expanded disclosure and auditing requirements and the responsibilities of the boards at all publicly-traded companies. Sarbanes-Oxley triggered similar reforms around the world: Australia in 2004, India in 2005, and Japan in 2006. Since then, other important reforms have been put in place - such as the Dodd-Frank Act enacted in 2010, in response to the banking industry excesses that resulted in the financial crisis, and the Jumpstart Our Business Startups, or JOBS Act, which was designed to facilitate the funding of small businesses in the US by exempting them from certain regulatory requirements.  The right mix of legislation, regulation, and self-regulation depend on a country’s specific circumstances, history, and culture. The corporate governance structures developed in response typically cover the ownership of publicly-listed companies and stock exchanges, shareholder rights and responsibilities, takeover rules, board structures and composition, and information disclosure. Technological progress has created situations where regulatory needs are not necessarily black and white. Services like Uber and Lyft, for example, have made it unclear if drivers should be treated like regular employees or contractors under the law. Legislation passed in California in 2019 requires these ride-sharing platforms to treat drivers in that state as employees when it comes to wage and benefit protections, creating uncertainty about the financial prospects of the broader “gig economy” amid the possibility that other states and countries might follow suit. This shift could impact many boards and the ways they approach compliance, risk management and corporate strategy. Other areas of technological development with significant corporate governance implications include artificial intelligence, blockchain, the Internet of Things, and biotechnology - all of which are likely to trigger new regulations and corporate governance needs.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.36"
"4.601","Regulatory Complexity","","In the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index 2017-2018, half of the economies ranked in the overall top ten also took top spots specifically in terms of the burden (or lack thereof) of government regulation, and transparency of government policy-making. The regulatory complexity that hinders performance is driven by economic and social complexity; new products and services, and novel ways of doing business, challenge existing regulatory regimes. Are Uber drivers employees or independent contractors, for example, and is Facebook a broadcaster or a public utility? Other prompts for new and evolving regulation include search engines, self-driving cars, drones, and digital currencies. Our abilities to gain access to bigger sets of data and more closely track behaviour call for more targeted regulation, and greater transparency. Yet, laws, regulations, and contracts are becoming longer, harder to interpret, and subject to more cross-referencing and potential conflicts. The first piece of major federal legislation in the US, the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, was 15 pages long; the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, known as Obamacare, was 907 pages long. According to an analysis by the US-based law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell, the Dodd-Frank Act, US financial legislation that was 848 pages long when passed in 2010, produced 22,000 pages of regulations by 2015. Meanwhile in Venezuela, opening a legal business requires completing 20 procedures that collectively consume an average of 230 days (compared with one procedure requiring half a day in New Zealand). Regulatory complexity can impact our everyday activity; researchers estimated in 2012 it would take the average person 244 hours a year to read all of the privacy policies they agree to online. Regulatory complexity is only growing, as rules and decisions governing economic activity appear. A New York Times review in 2017 found that more than 50 countries had passed new laws since 2012 related to operating on the internet, for example. Complexity follows, when rule-making in one jurisdiction overlaps or conflicts with that in another, or when jurisdictions seek to apply their rules outside of their territory. The United Nations World Investment Report for 2017 noted that investment policy-making is becoming more complex, uncertain, and divergent - reflecting the impact of sustainable development goals and diverse responses to globalization.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.90"
"4.602","Reign of Uncertainty","","Humanity has a way of aggravating natural uncertainty; the calamitous wildfires that swept across Northern California in 2018 after being triggered by activities like barbecuing and repairing power lines (and then amplified by the effects of climate change) were just one example. Technology in particular can trigger an uptick in the sort of low probability, potentially high impact events that can push governments to rethink the way they plan. Disruptive trends like the powerful influence of social media can make long term policy planning difficult, particularly if decision-makers expect to be able to make clear calculations of costs versus benefits, or to have a complete set of information on hand before decisions have to be made. The Arab Spring, which saw a number of protests organized spontaneously via social media, illustrated how suddenly disruption can occur when traditional political and administrative institutions are seen as no longer adequately meeting public needs. This has become a particularly acute risk, now that global wealth is concentrated in the hands of relatively few people - fuelling the politics of resentment and feeding the rise of populist demagogues. With uncertainty and ambiguity only likely to increase, it will become more important to build resilience into governance systems, instead of relying on brittle and narrowly-conceived policy solutions. This calls for building stronger foresight ability into every aspect of governance, whether it is in the public or private sector; collaborative, multi-stakeholder, and digitally-enabled processes that can tap into the broad-based wisdom of the crowds could be helpful in this regard. Building resilience should mean not just that systems can bounce back from crisis and shock, but that they can change and transform in response for the better. Some examples the power of building foresight for troubled communities include the Global Business Network’s work with stakeholders in South Africa on developing future scenarios, and the efforts of Reos Partners to organize collaborative work on the peace process in Colombia.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.8"
"4.603","Relations with the European Union","","The popularity of the European Union has dramatically declined in Italy during the past few years. This trend, in one of the six founding members of the European Economic Community (the EU’s precursor), is a consequence of a recession that followed the European debt crisis, and an influx of refugees. For many Italians, the austerity policies implemented in 2012 and 2013 were linked to the adoption in 2012 of the Fiscal Compact - a European intergovernmental treaty that governs budgetary targets, and limits Italy’s government spending. The popularity of the EU is also undercut by a perception that Italy is bearing the brunt of the refugee crisis, with insufficient support from fellow EU members. While many migrants and refugees who reach Italy flee to other countries soon afterward, those who remain often find it challenging to integrate. Many newcomers are unable to find jobs, and end up working in the illicit economy. In 2018, European leaders forged an agreement that involves sending asylum seekers to centres in both Africa and EU countries. Questions remain about the feasibility of the plan, and human rights advocates have criticized it for potentially exposing migrants to abuse. The erstwhile populist coalition that came to power in Italy in 2018, composed of right-wing parties the League and the Five Star Movement, sparred with European leaders over issues ranging from migration to the very future of the EU. The cabinet included Minister for European Affairs Paolo Savona, a professor of economics known for detailing a plan to leave the euro. Savona, who had initially been tapped to serve as Economy Minister but was vetoed due to his views on the euro, rarely disappointed Eurosceptics and regularly expressed sharp criticism of the way Europe and the eurozone are organized. While former Economy Minister Giovanni Tria took a less confrontational approach, he has since been replaced in a new government by Roberto Gualtieri, who is also the chairman of the European Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. The most controversial appointment in the more recently-elected, more conciliatory coalition government is Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio, who is the head of the Five Star Movement. Polls have consistently shown that despite mounting Euroscepticism, and persistently high public opinion of an adversarial approach to the EU, Italians remain strongly against the idea of leaving the political bloc.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.87"
"4.604","Relevant Specialized Education","","Employers are increasingly warning of widening gaps between the skills that are in demand, and those that are available - highlighting the need to foster more technical talent if countries want to remain competitive. There is a considerable skills mismatch between university graduates and the needs of employers in most economies. Without adequate modifications to education and training systems, this gap between supply and demand is projected to grow significantly. To address this, it will be critical to re-align global talent pipelines with market needs. Closing this gap will become more complex, as skills requirements change at an accelerating pace - particularly in fields such as information technology. This will require the collaboration of the public and private sectors. In particular, more needs to be done to better balance the focus of policy-makers, investors, and politicians between academic training, and technical and vocational education and training. There is a need to better understand the linkages between the two, and ways they can be complementary for individuals, businesses and economies (as noted in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization’s Education Strategy 2014-2021). High quality, timely career advice, and guidance can support the successful transition of young people from their school years to employment, by ensuring that they understand their options based on real labour market data and demand. Proactive career guidance can also help circumvent the gender stereotypes and socio-economic opportunity gaps that often hold young people back from choosing certain occupations. Technical and vocational education and training is underutilized, and often treated with neglect by education systems as a second-best option. Such training and education can be a key driver of economic growth, and can provide the skills required for jobs that will have real staying power in future labour markets. Technical qualifications are best designed through collaboration between employers and industry groups, and particular attention should be paid to fostering their evolution based on sets of agreed-upon standards.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.43"
"4.605","Religion in Ethics and Law","","Ethics and values based on religion shape laws and policies, and factor into global governance. The United Nations, for example, launched the so-called Fez Plan of Action in 2017, to help religious leaders use their influence to prevent violent atrocities. In order to fully understand systems of law and governance, and to build consensus on taking action on global challenges, one must consider how religion factors into local, national, and international identities, and into responses to complex issues. The intersection of law and religion continues to be a source of friction for many countries, as domestic courts consider questions about the free exercise, establishment, and accommodation of diverse religious practices. For example, in 2018, both the United Kingdom Supreme Court and the US Supreme Court considered cases where a bakery had refused to produce a cake associated with support for same-sex marriage on religious grounds. Legal conflicts (and related remedies) are also increasingly occurring across borders, and among culturally and religiously diverse participants including individuals, governments, corporations and non-governmental organizations. Understanding and adjudicating such challenges requires a sustained engagement with religion, ethics, political theory, and theories of globalization. Similarly, issues like nuclear proliferation, climate change, and the refugee crisis have raised questions about responsibility sharing and shared governance; an understanding of how morality, ethics, and religion influence the related policies and approaches of multinational institutions is essential for consensus building and action. Questions to be considered include whether there is a shared set of values across national borders (for example, a universal understanding of human rights) upon which joint action can be based, and how religion can help, or harm, such consensus building. Drawing lessons from the displacement narratives associated with religions, like the Exodus for Judaism, the flight of the new-born Jesus with Mary and Joseph to Egypt for Christianity, and the migration of Muhammad from Mecca to Medina for Islam, could help spur action on the forced displacement of refugees from the Middle East and North Africa, for example. Many of the first responders and aid workers in conflict and crisis situations are already religiously motivated, though, ironically, populist political movements in the West based on religious or socioeconomic identity often thwart international efforts to address global issues. Religion factors into the fundamental ways that political and legal systems are legitimated - and it must be taken into account in order to make real progress on our shared challenges.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.115"
"4.606","Resource Scarcity","","Resource scarcity – situations where the demand for resources outstrips supply – is already a central challenge in global governance. To take water as an example, the World Economic Forum’s 2016 Global Risks Report noted that 40% of the world’s population suffers water shortages lasting for at least one month during a given calendar year. The United Nations’ (UN) Sustainable Development Goals seek to change the existing situation in which 2.4 billion people lack access to basic sanitation. The challenges that currently exist, difficult as they are, will only be exacerbated by changes to the climate. The Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development’s Environmental Outlook to 2050, published in 2012, predicted that by 2050 nearly half of the world’s population will live under severe water stress. A similar story can be told in respect of other resources. It has long-been recognized that resource scarcity has the potential to contribute to conflict – with the manifest damage that inevitably follows to rights. Short of conflict, resource scarcity makes it difficult for states, and particularly developing states, to secure basic social and economic rights for their citizens. Over the last few decades, there has been increasing recognition of the equal importance of social and economic rights as part of the basic needs of individuals. On the normative level, international and national frameworks now more often seek to protect rights of access to, for example, land, water of a sufficient quality, and food. For instance, the UN’s human rights architecture includes a Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food and one on Safe Drinking Water and Sanitation. The UN Human Rights Council’s Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, adopted in 2011, include, within the core set of authoritative rights against which the human rights impact of businesses are assessed, those enshrined in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. In other words, businesses are required to consider how their acts affect social and economic rights. Moreover, the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, through its monitoring procedures and General Comments, has fleshed out meaning of the rights themselves. However, whatever developments there have been on the normative level are threatened in practice by the increasing pressure on resources. The causes range and are related – bad governance, failure to address and mitigate the effects of climate change, and exploitative practices. Moreover, resource scarcity often particularly affects the rights of vulnerable groups and magnifies existing inequalities. To a degree, more equitable allocative decisions can improve the situation. More fundamentally, though, it is necessary to come to terms with the many causes of resource scarcity in the first place. This will require cooperation among and between states and business. Due to its limited natural resources, Japan imports much of its critical material from abroad. Its self-sufficiency when it comes to food has dropped significantly over the past few decades, from 79% of domestic calories consumed produced in Japan as of 1960, to 38% by 2016. Meanwhile its energy self-sufficiency rate dropped from 58% as of 1960 to just 6% by 2014. Some of the country’s business sectors, such as electronics, are fully reliant on imports for their most critical components - such as the rare earth minerals that are used in manufacturing advanced devices.  The spectre of resource scarcity has led to developments such as the so-called Top-Runner programme, which establishes energy efficiency standards. The program was last amended in 2013 and now applies to product categories including passenger vehicles, air conditioners, and TV sets, according to the International Energy Agency. Japanese companies have gained global recognition for their energy efficiency, technology, and advanced business models, and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been supportive of developing more sustainable, circular economic models.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","['1.73', '1.88']"
"4.607","Resource Sustainability","","A growing global population and expanding middle class are increasing demand for food, and placing agricultural land, forests and water resources under greater amounts of strain. At the same time, farm systems are increasingly vulnerable to climate change and related weather volatility. As temperatures and sea levels rise at an accelerated pace, experts suggest that failing to limit global warming to 2°C above pre-industrial temperature levels would lead to irreversible damage. The global food value chain, including growers, producers and sellers, accounts for roughly 30% of global energy consumption, and generates greenhouse gases estimated at 10 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent every year, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations’ 2017 report The State of Food and Agriculture. Agriculture uses 11% of the world’s land surface for crop production, accounts for 70% of total freshwater withdrawals, and is responsible for about 80% of global deforestation, according to the report. The combined effect of climate and carbon dioxide change is as likely as not to increase food prices by as much as 45% by 2050, according to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published in 2014. There will also likely be a significant increase in related packaging; the production of plastics used in the packaging of food products is expected to nearly quadruple by 2050, according to the World Economic Forum’s 2016 report The New Plastics Economy. Developing more sustainable systems could have significant social and economic impacts, particularly in developing economies poised to leapfrog traditional, “take-make-dispose” approaches already prevalent elsewhere. In general, the plastics and agribusiness sectors must work together with multiple stakeholders, in order to maximize resource sustainability. Greater efforts at increasing sustainability are also called for when it comes to food produced in the oceans. Nearly one third of global fish stocks are being overfished, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations’ 2016 report State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture, jeopardizing economic and environmental security. Improved fishery management could both help to address overfishing, and create significant economic opportunity; research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA in 2016 estimated that strong fisheries management techniques could increase the annual global catch by more than 16 million tonnes, while creating $53 billion in additional profit.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.9"
"4.608","Responsibility and Accountability","","Leadership during the Fourth Industrial Revolution brings with it an opportunity to redefine economic systems, and to take necessary steps to address inequality. According to the 2018 World Inequality Report published by the Paris School of Economics, income inequality has increased rapidly since 1980 in North America, China, India, and Russia. Meanwhile the share of total national income accounted for by a country’s top 10% of earners has reached as high as 47% in the US and Canada, 55% in sub-Saharan Africa, Brazil, and India, and 61% in the Middle East. A starkly unequal share of income is only the most obvious indicator of inequality; related gaps are also building within other intersecting dimensions, like gender, skills, and opportunity. In a technology-driven future that places a high demand on social capital (relationships and shared norms) and skills, the ties between these varying dimensions may only grow closer. Meanwhile emerging technologies are chiselling authority away from governments and handing it to companies and non-state actors, altering the traditional view of governance. A report published in 2018 by the World Economic Forum described how technology pioneers are increasingly developing their own private rules, certification schemes, standards, and policies which end up as a default means to govern societies spanning across national borders. If governments alone can no longer govern emerging technologies, these or other sources of authority will fill the void, according to the report. This places significant responsibility on technology pioneers, who have so far operated on the margins of traditional accountability. Public discontent over specific issues such as the way many companies behind major technological advances effectively avoid taxes has grown into a broader concern about the disruptive power these companies can wield over politics and economies. While new models are needed to expand governance beyond existing public institutions, the private sector must meanwhile demonstrate leadership that goes beyond concern for the bottom line, and takes a systemic view of impact and influence. One example of taking a broader view is the independent foundation established by software firm Zendesk with proceeds from its IPO when it moved into an economically-challenged area of San Francisco; the foundation works to address poverty and the digital divide (separating those with internet access from those going without), and it demonstrates how the benefits of disruptive technology can be harnessed for the good of multiple stakeholders without necessarily creating a new set of losers.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.93"
"4.609","Responsible Data Use","","The growing pool of consumer data being deposited online presents opportunities to improve media products, and to increase the relevance of advertising-supported content. However, media content is often used simply as bait to gather user data, and careful scrutiny is called for when it comes to privacy and consumer protection. In the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation was implemented in 2018 to prevent companies from exploiting or retaining the personal data of internet users without their consent; companies in violation can be fined up to €20 million or 4% of their annual revenue, whichever is higher. Google was fined €50 million in France in early 2019 for failing to comply with GDPR obligations to provide full details to users about its data consent policies, and to provide sufficient control over how personal information is being used. In the US, legislators and regulators have been criticizing Facebook for failing to adequately protect its users’ data. Facebook can use this data in many different ways in order to enable advertisers to target their messaging, though in 2018 the company said it would remove thousands of targeting options that could be used to discriminate based on race or religion.      Traditional media outlets are increasingly competing for audience attention with newer platforms like Facebook, and with new content producers. Data monetization, done properly, could contribute to the economic sustainability of the existing media industry. A blog post published by Adobe in 2017 included data showing projected spending on digital ads increasing by about 76% between 2015 and 2019, compared with just a 10% increase for TV ad spending over the same period (with digital ads surpassing TV ads in value for the first time in the US in 2016); the post argued that if TV is to maintain the value of its content relative to digital channels, TV providers must tap into data to start delivering more value to advertisers. While some traditional news publishers have begun tapping new revenue streams by selling their users’ personal data, most have avoided the practice, according to research published by eMarketer in early 2019. These companies have opted to refrain from doing so either because the sale of even anonymized data could result in privacy violations and a breach of trust, because such a move risks selling off a competitive advantage, or because developing an ability to do so would simply cost too much money.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.94"
"4.610","Responsible Governance","","Since the opening of China’s economy in 1979, every echelon of society has undergone momentous change. The country has experienced unprecedented migration from inland areas to coastal cities, from rural to urban areas, and from farm work to factories - and then on to service sector jobs. This has shaken up social hierarchies, which are being redefined by an urban-rural split and an emerging middle class that the consultancy McKinsey has estimated will make up 40% of the population by 2020. Now, middle income, urban, and increasingly connected Chinese are demanding more than the basic necessities of life; they yearn for better jobs, better education, more affordable healthcare and housing, social security entitlements, a cleaner environment, and readily accessible entertainment. In the face of this, the Chinese government has adapted. As China’s population ages, for example, the government has abolished the ""one child"" policy, it has pushed forward reforms of healthcare and pensions, and it has reformed its household registration (""Hukou"") system in order to improve access to social welfare benefits for migrant workers streaming into urban areas. China has also allowed for greater access to information, albeit while maintaining centralized control. In 2015, China launched the Belt and Road Initiative, an ongoing, globally-ambitious infrastructure investment project that touches more than 60 different economies. Sina News has reported that this effort is projected to have an impact on nearly one quarter of all global exports of goods and services, equal in value to about $21 trillion. In a related development, in the past 15 years or so, China has become a significant investor in Africa’s infrastructure. As the country’s economy and the size of its middle class expands, responsible governance is essential in terms of both international and domestic affairs. Local people's congresses in Chinese cities have been granted an ability to adopt their own local laws and regulations, as long as these do not contradict national and provincial law. At the same time, in 2018, the National People’s Congress (NPC), China’s federal legislature, adopted an amendment to the constitution that removes term limits for the country’s president and vice president.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.30"
"4.611","Responsible Innovation","","The onset of Fourth Industrial Revolution has brought with it a rapid evolution of technology, with development accelerating at a speed never before witnessed. While this brings with it tremendous opportunities, there are also new risks. Social structures and assumptions are in a state of flux, and we are facing big questions about data, in particular, in terms of ownership, quality, access, and use. It is imperative to avoid creating technology-related global inequality. While inequality has actually been decreasing in developing countries where digital communications systems are contributing to greater financial inclusion in places with limited infrastructure, in high- and middle-income countries inequality is worsening. In these countries, labour-saving technology has begun to replace decently-paid blue collar jobs, and the workers who once held those jobs may now be employed in retail-related or other roles, where the pay is typically lower. We need to maintain awareness of the potential for technology to exacerbate inequality, environmental damage, and social tension, and ensure that technology improves, rather than degrades, human and environmental well-being. In this regard, the concept of agile governance has become increasingly prevalent, as it emphasizes policy-makers and regulators working together with private developers, industries, and civil society organizations in order to exercise more responsible digital leadership, and in order to be able to more quickly adapt to changing circumstances. There is still, however, a risk of public backlash against technology. More dialogue and cooperation among companies, regulators, investors, consumers, and workers will be essential for earning and sustaining public trust.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.123"
"4.612","Restructuring Global Value Chains","","For many years, the fastest-growing category of international trade was “intermediate” trade between the nodes in global supply chains, adding value incrementally. This generated higher levels of freight movement, and helped the value of international trade grow at least two or three times faster than global GDP. After the global financial crisis, however, this so-called “trade multiplier” dropped to 1.5, as trade growth slowed. The potential for future growth has meanwhile been constrained by the failure of World Trade Organization (WTO)’s Doha round of negotiations, and a significant net increase in trade-restrictive measures. Long term progress towards trade liberalization may now reverse, following US withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and renegotiation the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) - while the Trump administration’s tariffs applied in response to what it regards as unfair trade may result in trade wars. The United Kingdom’s decision to withdraw from the European Union is also likely to inhibit trade and disrupt cross-border supply chains. On the other hand, a recent agreement by 44 African states to form a Continental Free Trade Area shows that trade liberalization is still very much alive at the regional level. Some observers had forecast significant reshoring (or nearshoring) of manufacturing from low-labour-cost countries back to North America and Europe, due to wage inflation in emerging markets, rising transport costs, shortening order lead-times, and increased concern about supply chain risk. The increasing automation of production facilities in developed countries, and technologies such as 3D printing, which can shift the production of goods closer to the people who buy them, have also raised the prospect of significant reshoring. However, some companies may instead respond to wage inflation in places such as China and India by further shifting production to even lower-labour-cost countries. Regional trade agreements mean that production shifts and trade growth may occur more on a continental than a global scale. The reconfiguration of value chains may therefore be more pronounced at a regional level, potentially intensifying trading links between emerging markets. While trade liberalization has been faltering, trade facilitation has continued apace. For example, the so-called “single windows” that centralize procedures for customs and border compliance have proliferated. In addition, it is estimated that full implementation of the Trade Facilitation Agreement reached by WTO members in Bali in 2013 could generate $1 trillion of additional trade.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.122"
"4.613","Rewiring the Indian State","","India has been described as a 21st-century economic and diplomatic entity powered by a 19th-century state - as the capacity of institutions has failed to keep pace with wider changes in the economy. The country underperforms on even basic measures; it has an average of just 1.4 civil servants per 100 people, for example, compared to the OECD average of 7.7. The ratio of police-to-citizens is meanwhile 129 per 100,000, with only Uganda faring significantly worse on this metric. The judiciary has a backlog of 33 million cases, most of them stuck in the lower courts, and the law commission says an additional 70,000 judges are needed. And, this country of more than a billion people has only 970 diplomats, or as many as New Zealand (population 5 million). A related issue is the lack of fiscal capacity needed to help the state fund its public goods, development, and welfare commitments without putting public finances under stress. India has a narrow direct tax base that forces the government to impose high indirect taxes, and fiscal modernization is a work in progress. The country's income tax-to-GDP ratio is still less than 3%, below the average for similar developing economies.   India has taken some recent steps - both technological and technocratic - to bridge the state capacity gap. The “Aadhaar” digital identity programme, for example, has spearheaded a drive towards greater digital governance. Meanwhile related programmes are underway such as digitization of land records, direct income transfers through bank accounts, and biometric attendance checks at health and administrative facilities - which could all help improve governance. The government has also attempted technocratic solutions, as detailed in reports from the second Administrative Reforms Commission (which is intended to revamp public administration). Its recommendations range from allowing lateral entry into the top echelons of the bureaucracy, to rethinking roles and responsibilities at the lower levels. India’s score in Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index has improved slightly in recent years, though it still ranked 78th out of 180 countries as of 2018. World Bank indicators reflect similar rankings in terms of government effectiveness and rule of law, pointing to an urgent need for India to re-assess its institutional capability and the governance structure of the state - if it wants to remain a thriving market economy that derives political legitimacy from its citizens, while delivering on its basic promises to them.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.77"
"4.614","Rights of Artists","","The freedom of expression is recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the United Nation General Assembly in 1948, and in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights adopted in 1966 - and it is often taken for granted. Still, many artists cannot create or disseminate their art for fear of reprisal or prosecution. A report published by the international organization Freemuse registered 553 cases of violations of artists’ rights, in 78 countries, for 2017. On average, one artist per week was prosecuted for expressing themselves during the year, according to the report; the list of top 10 countries found to have censored the most in terms of art works and banned artists included the US, Ukraine, France, and China. Attacking artists and their creative practices is equivalent to attacking freedom of expression. It is imperative that creative voices remain free to speak out and produce work without the threat of retribution, in order to develop a global society with a plurality of voices and respect for the basic tenets of democracy - and to counter intolerant and illiberal societies. Freedom of expression contributes to the safeguarding of the freedom of information, and can ensure that citizens have access to broad-ranging, useful, uncensored and thought-provoking knowledge. A key aspect of artists’ rights is intellectual property protection. At a moral level, this can help individuals and communities to be properly recognized for their creativity, and to remain in control of its use. It also provides an important source of income for artists. While the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, adopted in 1886, established a framework for artists and creators to control how their works are used, the more-than-100-year-old structure is ill adapted to the complexities of the modern world and new technologies. The rise of digital platforms and streaming has disrupted existing business models, and raises numerous issues regarding the right to be compensated for creative work. The nature of sharing on these platforms has taken most property rights away from the artists themselves, leaving many with little to no resulting income. Technologies like blockchain may yet enable creators to engage more directly with fans, however, and develop platforms that protect the value chain of creative output. This key issue was curated in partnership with Huib Schippers, Director of Smithsonian Folkways Recordings at the Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.13"
"4.615","Rise of Non-State Actors","","The rising power of non-state actors is transforming international security. According to a 2015 report on Armed Non-State Actors by the Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces, conflict today is mostly a matter of two or more non-state actors fighting within the borders of a state. These actors come in the form of insurgent, separatist, pirate and local- or globally-affiliated terrorist organizations, often acting in collaboration with organized crime. Another factor empowering non-state actors is the tendency for external state involvement to take a form of proxy war, such as clandestine or deniable support for some form of non-state actor operating inside the target country.  The decision by the Pentagon to open a Silicon Valley office in 2015 recognized a power shift: private sector research and development budgets have soared above those of state defence agencies, and are producing dual-purpose technologies in artificial intelligence and robotics with huge weapons potential, yet are obtainable on the open market. A 2015 study on the Future Operating Environment 2035 by the UK Ministry of Defence estimated that such “off-the-shelf” commercial technologies are likely to become dual-use or reverse engineered, and employed by a spectrum of actors. Advances like additive manufacturing (3D printing) can increase the amount of illicit and unregulated technology transfer, exacerbating security threats. This so-called “democratization of destruction” empowers non-state actors through increased access to critical enablers previously reserved to advanced states. Hard encryption enables secret communication of market-sensitive information and operational plans. Social media offers powerful marketing opportunities, and also gives political movements new ways to recruit and propagandize.  So long as non-state actors’ capabilities fell far behind those of states, the sophistication of an attack suggested evidence of who was behind it. But as the capability gap closes, it becomes harder to quickly determine who is behind an attack, and to gain public trust and support for collective action. An attack on state institutions by non-state actors is becoming harder to distinguish from a state-sponsored attack by proxy, especially in a digitised social media environment that is vulnerable to manipulation. Whether it is “little green men” appearing in Ukraine, or highly capable “hacktivist” groups on a mission to expose hypocrisy, however selectively, the line between inter-state conflict and civil war is increasingly blurred.  From the so-called Islamic State (ISIS) to Al Qaeda, Boko Haram or the Nusra front, violent extremist groups draw on local grievances and state fragility to carve out a physical base, as described in the World Economic Forum 2016 Global Risks Report, but they operate in a global network of shifting allegiances, logistics and inspirational propaganda. The International Institute for Strategic Studies assessed in 2016 that ISIS had formalised relationships with groups in eight countries from Africa, the Caucasus, South Asia and Southeast Asia, as well as the Middle East. The metaphor the former head of the UK’s Secret Intelligence Service used to describe the result is that when you squeeze the (terrorist) balloon, you see it bulging out in multiple new locations. While non-state actors exploit the infrastructure created for legitimate economic and social interaction across borders, public policy to counter them necessarily involves closer coordination with the private sector. Meanwhile, businesses, cities and civil society organizations are increasingly developing in-house security capabilities to fend off hacking attacks. These non-state actors are enhancing their ability to manage political risk, and there is a burgeoning discussion about “foreign policy” for private sector actors, especially via start-ups that begin their business life at the transnational level. This suggests the scale of unexplored potential for effective cooperation among legitimate non-state actors, such as commercial enterprises, city-level government and non-governmental organizations, on security matters.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.83"
"4.616","Rise of Populism","","Globalization, growing inequality, immigration, and a lack of trust in public institutions have given rise to numerous populist movements, which in many cases blend nationalist, xenophobic appeals with an opposition to government and big business. These movements generally express scepticism of elites, and put their faith in the wisdom of the masses. However, right-wing versions of these movements also tend to have an authoritarian bent, and a belief in a strong leader to speak for those masses. Europe has spawned more than a dozen right-wing, populist parties, from Jobbik in Hungary to UKIP in the United Kingdom, while US President Donald Trump successfully used populist messaging in the 2016 election. Populist movements typically appeal to those worried about their social status, job loss, the arrival of new immigrants, and shifting cultural mores; their supporters believe that globalization has been hurtful, immigration is a threat to their safety, that free trade has reduced job options and that big institutions cannot be trusted. They often harken back to a mythical “better” time when their nation’s values were purer, people like themselves were respected, and common sense ruled the day. Their policy positions tend to deal with the symptoms of problems, like halting immigration when it reaches the border, and tend to ignore uncomfortable truths such as climate change by rejecting the views of recognized experts. What is happening now has occurred in the past. Experts on the temperance movement to end alcohol use in the US, for example, have noted that many supporters focused their criticisms on catholic immigrants from Italy and Ireland who may have taken a more liberal approach to alcohol than protestants, for example. Temperance was therefore partly an attempt to assert moral superiority over these newcomers, in a bid to have them abide by one version of “American” values. Another historical parallel: many supporters of Adolf Hitler were those whose wealth had evaporated with Germany’s hyper-inflation in the 1920s, and were particularly anxious about their professional and social status. These movements can generate outcomes such as reduced immigration or trade curbs that are only temporary palliatives, and can actually hinder economic growth. That in turn can lead to growing authoritarianism, increasing distrust of institutions, and a fetish for simplistic solutions to complex problems like the elimination of central banks, or closing off societies completely to trade and immigration.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.33"
"4.617","Rising Consumerism","","After decades of export-driven growth, China aims to shift its economy by boosting domestic consumption. Chinese consumer confidence has been resilient; the value of the country’s fast-moving consumer goods market rose by 4.3% in 2017, compared with 3.6% growth in the prior year, according to a report published by Bain & Company and Kantar Worldpanel. In 2016, the Economist Intelligence Unit projected that private consumption in China would grow in real terms by 5.5.% a year on average until 2030, at which point it will account for nearly half of the overall economy. Urbanization has boosted consumerism; nearly 60% of China’s population lived in a city as of 2018, according to estimates, and the country’s urban population is increasing by an estimated 2.4% annually, steadily convening greater numbers of middle-class shoppers in places with accessible retail outlets. China’s dynamic e-commerce market is also addressing rising consumption demands. In 2015, the Chinese agency responsible for internet affairs reported 668 million internet users in the country, of which 594 million were connected using smartphones. According to a report published in late 2017 by the McKinsey Global Institute, China accounted for 42% of global e-commerce, and processed 11 times more mobile payments than the US. Home-grown retailers in China are increasingly competitive, and adept at adapting to local market needs. The country’s services sector, which now accounts for more than half of the country’s economy, will become increasingly important as domestic demand for entertainment, recreation, and healthcare increases. Consumer behaviour in China is also generating larger numbers of outbound tourists. According to the World Tourism Organization, the number of outbound Chinese tourists surpassed 100 million in 2014, after more than a decade of double-digit annual percentage growth. In addition, Chinese tourists spent $261.1 billion in 2016, a 4.5% increase compared with the prior year and more than any other nationality, according to a report published in 2017 by Nielsen. A potential limiting factor for Chinese consumption, however, is the country’s high savings rate (that could be addressed, if the Chinese government provides better healthcare and pension coverage). In addition, a recent anti-corruption crackdown has dampened consumer appetite for luxury goods.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.30"
"4.618","Rising Cost of Law","","As the complexity of law and regulation increases, so do legal costs. Law has a tendency to accumulate; contracts become longer as lawyers add specific concerns, or account for new court decisions. Statutes and regulations, meanwhile, become longer as new circumstances or efforts to address unanticipated responses to the law arise. And, court decisions become longer as judges try to reconcile large bodies of pre-existing case law. Law can also become more complex as the diversity of interests and viewpoints grows, while legislation grows more intricate as political deals are implemented. Researchers have found that US Supreme Court opinions become harder to interpret as the number of judges signing onto a majority opinion increases. Longer, more ambiguous legal materials, and more complex procedures, have the effect of raising the cost of law by requiring more time and expertise. It is routine for the parties to litigation in the US to spend more on legal costs than the amount at stake in the case, for example. Indirect costs are also raised by increased legal complexity and uncertainty, while globalization can also increase the cost of law as international entities need to learn about an increasing number of jurisdictions; even startups can incur related costs, when they use teams that collaborate online from multiple locations. Higher legal costs impact government budgets, through the cost of financing courts and prosecutors, and due to the cost of financing legal aid. Complexity is not the only reason for higher legal costs; restrictive professional rules governing who can practice law, and where, and using what technology, business model, and contractual arrangement, can also contribute. The US and Canada, for example, require all legal work to be done by licensed lawyers with graduate training that can be prohibitively expensive, and prohibit these lawyers from forming arrangements with technology companies that could reduce costs. Many countries require lawyers to be licensed locally, increasing the cost of operating in multiple jurisdictions. Other countries prohibit lawyers from opening offices in multiple locations, or in partnership with non-lawyers, or under advertised brand names. All of these restrictions raise the cost of law, and threaten the development of technologies that could both increase quality and cut costs.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.90"
"4.619","Rising Multipolarity","","As globalization has spurred higher levels of economic growth around the world, new countries have emerged as major powers in world politics. This marks an extraordinary advance in terms of human development, as hundreds of millions of people escape poverty and join the middle class. At the same time, however, the economic rise of Brazil, China, India, and other emerging markets has upended the traditional power balance among countries - along with traditional structures of global governance. Whereas in the past a few large, industrialized countries could set the rules for the global economy, today a much broader consensus among nations is required. This is reflected in the increased importance of the G20 (as opposed to the more exclusive G7) as a critical venue for international economic coordination, and in the emergence of greater numbers of institutional investors from emerging markets who now wield global influence, such as the Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which began operations in 2016. Rising multi-polarity, or the distribution of power among a greater number of countries and entities, raises the possibility of a more balanced, and ultimately more legitimate form of global governance; more places can now have more of a say on the critical global issues that affect their respective citizens. However, this wider dispersion of global power has also created new sources of friction and risk, and even in some cases the greater possibility of armed conflict. That is due in part to the fact that the decision-making processes that underpin global governance do not tend to adapt and change as quickly as the relative influence of the countries involved. There is therefore an urgent need to find new ways to facilitate decision-making and international coordination, in order to ensure that global challenges can be met effectively. As greater numbers of more diverse countries must now reach agreement on how to best address global issues, the potential gridlock that could result would benefit no one. The ways in which emerging powers engage with existing structures of global governance, and the ways that established powers react to these changes, will define world politics in the 21st century.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.68"
"4.620","Risk and Uncertainty","","Many emerging multinationals can actually thrive in high-risk environments. In regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia, for example, rapid population growth is a potential asset for the future, but also generates tension due to high rates of youth unemployment; meanwhile political and legal institutions in these areas tend to be relatively weak, mostly as a result of a disastrous colonial heritage, ethno-religious conflicts, civil wars, and pervasive corruption. These also happen to be parts of the world that collectively hold as much as 70% of global fossil fuel and mineral reserves. As these countries and their consumer markets further integrate into the global economy, it will be crucial to understand the inherent risks that they pose. Many emerging multinationals were born in environments characterized by high levels of economic and political risk. They grew up in a context that forced them to cope with these risks, and even to capitalize on them. No wonder that many have therefore been able to aggressively expand into high-risk markets. Political risk is not confined to developing markets. In 2018, Chinese telecommunications giant ZTE was hit with a US government ban on its purchase of equipment from American firms, and carriers in the United Kingdom were warned against using its products, due to political and security concerns. Uncertainty is generally considered inimical to economic activity; consumers lose confidence, companies become reluctant to invest, and investors run for cover. One key source of geopolitical risk has to do with the deterioration of democratic practices. According to a report published  the Center for Systemic Peace in 2017, the number of countries designated “anocratic regimes,” which lack a capacity to manage conflict and foster social integration, and are vulnerable to autocratic rule, has nearly doubled since the end of the Cold War. Meanwhile failed states, such as Libya or South Sudan, where governments have lost control over part or all of their territory, have spawned chaos, lawlessness, and anarchy. Unintended fallout from the Arab Spring uprisings, and armed conflict throughout sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, account for most of the world’s anocracies and failed states. Given the present realities of geopolitical risk, companies that can cope relatively well will enjoy a competitive advantage, as distinctions between mature and volatile markets are increasingly blurred.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.46"
"4.621","Risk-Return Ratios","","Political stability, currency volatility, and a general lack of familiarity with a foreign environment can all generate significant real and perceived risks relative to the expected returns from development projects in emerging and frontier markets. Banks, asset managers, and other private capital providers have a fiduciary duty to ensure that capital is preserved, and so must ensure that any returns are risk-appropriate; if the risk premium for deals in developing countries is considered too high, private institutions will often opt to keep their investments in more familiar, developed markets. However, if projects in emerging markets can be efficiently structured and de-risked through Blended Finance, they can become more attractive investment options. Assessments can be skewed by uncertainty, however, and cautious investment behaviour. For example, the majority of infrastructure debt securities issued between 1983 and 2014 by corporate issuers outside of North America were investment grade, according to a report published by Moody’s Investors Service in 2015, and recent studies have actually found lower relative default rates for such bonds originating in emerging markets. Still, only a fraction of total institutional capital finds its way to projects in emerging and frontier markets, because of fundamental misperceptions about the associated risk. The challenge for projects in developing countries is therefore to try enhance returns for some capital tranches, while appropriately transferring risk to those interested parties best suited to manage it. Blended Finance addresses this challenge by pooling investors with different capital and risk profiles, in order to create commercial tranches that are each tailored with an appropriate balance of risk and return - in order to make a project bankable. This allows financiers to overcome real and perceived market failures, in order to support investment in projects that can deliver significant, positive development impact.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.23"
"4.622","Risks to Space Sustainability","","Since the start of the so-called Space Age in 1957, activity in space has expanded to an extent that threatens the sustainability of orbits (the natural pathways for satellites that circle Earth) - even as most countries have yet to launch a satellite. More than 95% of space debris in Earth’s orbit is composed of used materials, dead satellites, rocket parts, propellant residues, and nuts and bolts. About 23,000 pieces are tracked by the US Air Force, while more than 300,000 smaller, untracked objects pose a threat to active satellites (some of which have been destroyed) and astronauts; a US National Research Council Report published in 2011 noted that space debris had already reached a tipping point. Meanwhile risks resulting from the growing numbers of satellites include interference with radio signals. An increasing number of private satellite operators, lower launch costs, and governments’ inability to enforce sustainability guidelines mean these risks will become more pressing as the militarization of space increases. Private companies (mainly from the US) are preparing to launch thousands of low-earth orbit satellites, primarily to provide internet connectivity. Most will have limited maneuverability and short lifespans, and will add considerable traffic to already busy orbits; there is no universal, effective traffic management system to control this.  The International Space Station, the largest crewed spacecraft, already actively avoids space debris on a regular basis. Even if we were to stop sending new objects into space, debris would still increase due to chance collisions - because as large pieces collide, they produce more pieces. While technologies exist to start removing the most volatile pieces of debris, international cooperation is needed to finance this and account for related legal aspects. The Satellite Industry Association has estimated that about $127 billion in annual revenue from satellite services is vulnerable to debris, and the defence sector has expressed related concerns. Some attempts have been made to control debris. The Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee and the United Nations Committee on Peaceful Uses of Outer Space have adopted related mitigation guidelines, for example. However, due to their non-binding nature and inability to address the removal of existing debris, these efforts may not fully address space sustainability. The World Economic Forum’s Global Future Council on Space Technologies has developed a “Space Sustainability Rating” meant to support existing guidelines, by publishing ratings of individual mitigation efforts - and thereby increasing transparency.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.120"
"4.623","Robots at Work","","Robots have long been used on factory floors for welding and painting. Now, they’re making custom-ordered hamburgers, navigating through crowded hotel lobbies, hopping on elevators, and delivering room service. Amazon has been at the forefront of introducing robots to our daily lives, with its clerk-free markets that enable automatic payment via credit card, Kiva merchandise handling systems, and drone delivery. Robots also enable exploration, by probing the depths of the ocean floor, deep space, the moon, and asteroids. The latest space-ready robots can work side-by-side with astronauts in the International Space Station, and US and Russian teams are working on robo-astronauts that could explore other planets. Robots are also being developed to perform crucial jobs during humanitarian crises. For example, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Robotics Challenge is developing robots that would have been capable of saving lives during the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan. Other robots in development may perform hazardous deep mining jobs, work with toxic substances, and clean sewers. Drones in particular have captured the popular imagination; they are a popular option for aerial photography, and Amazon and others are testing their use for delivery.  In less dramatic fashion, robots can use an electronic brain located in the cloud to become trustworthy butlers, silently and faithfully listening to queries about traffic, the weather, and turning on the air conditioning. Next-generation robots will be performing tasks that require even more complex decision-making, aided by continuously increasing computing power. In January 2016 the company Nvidia unveiled a supercomputer capable of up to 24 trillion operations per second, equal to the power of 150 MacBook Pro notebook computers. This could enable a car to learn to drive by itself, through so-called reinforcement learning, rather than the conventional approach of finding a safe path by using real-time optimization. As related technologies mature, self-driving cars will become common, and will likely fundamentally change the job market by eliminating occupations like bus driver. Critical tasks that go beyond physical labour, such as reading x-ray films and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, are already being performed by computers. Discovering new medicines might even be a possibility; after all, artificial intelligence is already helping to dispense financial advice to many people, with considerable accuracy and speed.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.12"
"4.624","Rule of Law and Enforcement","","An effective, impartial and efficient legal system is the necessary foundation for efforts to curb corruption. Enforcing laws against officials who demand petty bribes, for example, has the instantaneous impact of removing an invisible tax levied on citizens seeking basic healthcare, or on businesses seeking simple documentation. It also makes a longer-term impact by shifting incentives; officials become more cautious about making such demands, because the risk associated with doing so has risen. Meanwhile citizens and businesses may start to refuse to pay bribes, because they see an opportunity to avoid related costs while still successfully interacting with the state. The confidence that can be inspired by such a legal framework can encourage companies to set up operations in a particular jurisdiction, rather than taking their business elsewhere. An economic analysis published in the journal World Development found that checks on corruption and “private capture” (the manipulation of public laws by private firms or individuals) had a stronger empirical relationship to economic growth than the protection of property rights in all 74 economies studied. Effective oversight of an independent judiciary is critical for establishing strong rule of law and public trust. The World Justice Project produces annual rankings of the rule of law in different countries. In December 2017, it published an evaluation of changes made to Mexico’s procedures for investigating crime, prosecution services, and trial organization. By the deadline for implementation of the new system, only about half of the country’s municipalities had complied, which is unfortunate as survey data has found that judges are far more likely to be present during court hearings under the new system - most likely because they are more frequently recorded. Corruption can be exported by multinationals operating in jurisdictions where the rule of law and law enforcement are relatively weak. The US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act of 2010 seek to clamp down on this phenomenon, as does the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) Anti-Bribery Convention. According to a Transparency International report on the subject published in 2015, the OECD convention is actively enforced in only two countries outside of the US and the UK: Germany and Switzerland. In addition, the convention was only moderately enforced in six more countries, according to the report, and the countries that enjoy active or moderate enforcement of the OECD convention account for less than a third of global exports.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.37"
"4.625","Rural Development and Sustainability","","Nearly 14% of the rural population in Peru, which overwhelmingly depends on agriculture for its economic well-being, is affected by extreme poverty, according to a 2016 report from the country’s National Institute of Statistics and Informatics; that compares with just 1% of Peru’s urban population, according to the report. Overall, nearly one quarter Peru’s employment as of 2017 was related to agriculture, which nonetheless accounted for less than 8% of the country’s GDP as of 2016, according to World Bank data.  Agriculture productivity in Peru lags behind that of other Latin American countries in part due to limited access to land and water. Only about one quarter of the country’s farmers owned officially-registered land as of 2012, according to the country’s National Agricultural Census (CENAGRO), which in turn limits farmers’ access to credit. According to the CENAGRO data, only about one in 10 farmers who sought a loan were able to obtain one. Agricultural loans represented just 5.5% the total loans granted in Peru during 2017, according to the country’s Superintendency of Banking, Insurance and Private Pension Funds. In addition, CENAGRO data showed that most farmers neither use improved seeds nor have received training or technical assistance. In order to increase agricultural productivity, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) has recommended policy initiatives that emphasize the provision of rural infrastructure, clearer property rights, improved access to financing, and greater fostering of innovation. In addition to technical, land and credit issues, risks related to climate change also hamper Peru’s agriculture sector, according to research published in 2016 by the IDB. Peru ranked 64th out of 180 countries assessed in the 2018 Environmental Performance Index (EPI) produced by Yale University and Columbia University in collaboration with the World Economic Forum, below Uruguay, Colombia, and Costa Rica. Increased agricultural production has been linked to 130,000 hectares of deforestation annually in the Amazon region, where Peru has more than 73 million hectares of natural forest - equivalent to about 60% of the country’s total national territory - according to its Ministry of the Environment. Peru is one of the world’s leading producers of copper, silver, tin, zinc, lead and gold. As recently as 2012, more than half of the foreign currency entering the country was accounted for by the mining sector, according to the Peruvian Economy Institute, as well as one fifth of the country’s fiscal income, and 11% of overall GDP. However, the role of mining in Peru’s economy has declined in recent years. The country’s mineral rents as a percentage of GDP, or the difference between the value of their production at global market rates and the cost of production, fell from about 11% as of 2011 to about 5.4% as of 2015, according to World Bank data. The sector generates a significant amount of social and environmental conflicts, and broader, related multi-stakeholder dialog is called for in order to better develop its economic potential.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.106"
"4.626","Safety and Security Risks","","The recent rise in both physical and digital terrorism has been coupled with a surge in populism and xenophobia. This new global landscape has significant implications for the movement of people across borders, and for a travel and tourism industry that is responsible for the safety of millions of air travellers every day. Air travel is one of the safest modes of transportation. However, air travel security shocks have at times led to measures that have merely soothed the public - rather than contributing to the creation of a more secure environment. Opportunities to enhance travel safety and security exist through the use of data sharing technologies, and better collaboration among governments, international institutions and the private sector. Contrary to popular perception, travellers are willing to share their personal data in exchange for enhanced security and efficiency.﻿ Global leaders need to fundamentally rethink the policy framework governing the ways people move across international borders, in order to better ensure safety. The World Economic Forum’s 2017 report Digital Borders presented a vision for the future of travel where eligibility is based on the individual, rather than on the individual’s country of origin, and where technology is implemented to move from physical borders to digital borders that include digital identification and authentication, biometrics, and digitally-enabled security devices that increase accuracy and efficiency. In order to move from existing bilateral or multilateral travel facilitation programmes to a global system, a number of areas need to be addressed: the harmonization of intelligence and data-sharing; the global implementation of common standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organization; and a shift to secure digital processes. Countries should expand their existing multilateral agreements, and move towards a single application system for traveller programmes. These shifts would require greater cooperation and collaboration among governments, international organizations and travellers. By moving border management to a wholly automated, electronic platform that is built on verified biometric data, the international movement of people will not only become more efficient, but will also enable public safety officials to direct more of their attention and resources to the identification of genuine threats.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.16"
"4.627","Safety, Security and the IoT","","The Internet of Things, which is stringing the world around us together via the web, is melding the digital and the physical realms in a way that creates threats that have not been anticipated by conventional cyber security systems. The IoT’s breadth of scale and uses pose significant challenges by exposing large areas to unconventional attacks. Energy utilities, infrastructure, transportation, commerce, and peoples’ homes are all now interconnected and remotely addressable, creating an unprecedented potential for security breaches; the same interconnectivity that can create value also means that compromising a single node could trigger cascading social and economic effects. Not all security challenges are obvious, and the unintended consequences of connectivity are always possible. For example, a smart home makes life easier not just for its occupants, but for criminals as well. A voice-activated home assistant paired with a smart, IoT-connected lock is a great way to open a door without having to get up from the couch; it is also a great means for a thief to simply shout through an open window while homeowners are away in order to let himself in. Authentication, or an ability to clearly identify and trust both digital and physical data sources, is a critical when developing the reliable, real-time systems that make the Internet of Things valuable. The days of trusting “security through obscurity,” or relying on a general ignorance of the flaws in a system, are numbered - as the advent of the IoT has now placed the blueprints of formerly inaccessible systems all over the internet. What would once have simply been thought of as a safety oversight can now be a potent weapon, if placed in the wrong hands. As a result, security must be integrated into system design from the start. Systems must be hardened against worst-case scenarios and upgradable over the air, even if it means increased costs. A so-called “Cognitive Firewall” is one method of scalable, upgradable protection; it forms a self-learning system, capable of placing the commands it receives in context, and allowing only safe commands to pass from the cloud to a device for execution. Many people are unwitting participants in the Internet of Things, potentially unaware, for example, that their personal data can be exposed to the world by means of a coworker’s unsecured “smart” light switch. A comprehensive safety education for everyone is therefore essential.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.86"
"4.628","Secure Data Transmission","","Next-generation digital networks are expected to make broadband connectivity a reality anywhere, anytime. Every facet of our lives is going to be digitalized and networked, as governments around the world push initiatives involving self-driving vehicles, environmental monitoring and online payments. This will increase the exchange of sensitive data across networks, and the networking of critical assets. The key to the success of these initiatives is therefore the protection of data integrity, and of data privacy. Since the World War II, increasingly robust and diverse cryptographic techniques, used to essentially write sensitive information in code, have been deployed to keep the data on networks secure. State-of-the-art cryptographic techniques are based on the exchange of widely available public keys, and undisclosed private keys, both of which function like passwords and are related through complex mathematical expressions. Due to ever-increasing computing power, however, these keys may become vulnerable to so-called brute-force attacks, which involve testing all the possible combinations of characters in a key through extensive trial and error, in order to decrypt information. Traditionally, a dedicated security layer within a network’s protocol stack, or the software that sets the rules for a network’s interconnectivity, is used to provide secrecy - while the physical layer of networking equipment is limited to tasks related to signal processing and transmission. However, it has recently been discovered that the physical layer can also be used to potentially provide security. Emerging cryptographic techniques like quantum cryptography, which relies on physics rather than math in order to encode information using elements such as light particles, deserve attention; the first quantum transaction, in 2004, used entangled photons to transfer money into a bank account. Blockchain is another networking paradigm gaining traction, as a distributed, cryptography-based service enabler. Privacy is not necessarily guaranteed through blockchain, but the integrity of data can be ensured using the technology, which can also reduce transaction costs - and is expected to be adopted for a wide variety of applications in the near future. Policy-makers and system architects must take these new paradigms into account, when conceiving the next generation of communications infrastructure. In addition, communities focused on open source software, developers, industry groups must seek to ensure that proposed solutions are affordable, and can be widely adopted.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.39"
"4.629","Securing People and Processes","","Cyberthreats challenge our ability to harness the full benefits of the digital economy. Cyberattacks result in an annual loss of more than $400 billion for the global economy, according to Our Shared Digital Future, a report published by the World Economic Forum in 2018, while the average cost of a data breach is $3.62 million. In the first half of 2018 alone, more than 4 billion data records were compromised by malicious actors worldwide, according to the report; this translates into more than one million records that are lost or stolen every hour. In addition to resulting in data theft or loss, inadequate security can put the integrity of data into question - because malicious actors with network access can insert or remove any relevant data that are used for decision-making, for example, or for industrial processes. Although criminal activity is the source of the vast majority of cyberattacks, there has been a growing incidence of nation state-sponsored intrusions onto critical networks. Nation-state-sponsored and hacktivist-driven attacks on so-called Industrial Internet of Things systems in the utilities, oil and natural gas and manufacturing industries are increasing, according to a report published by Accenture in 2018; 66% of IT managers in the oil and natural gas industry surveyed for the report said digitization has made them more vulnerable. Such state-sponsored attacks, deployed as clandestine statecraft, can erode both public trust and sovereign authority. They also re-direct public resources to build tools that may eventually wind up in the hands of criminals, exacerbating the already significant threat posed to businesses and individuals. These activities actually threaten innovation itself, by depriving peaceful actors of trusted technology platforms for the development of new business and social models. Due to the inability of any one nation or company to solve these issues on their own, it is vital to consider security a global public good - and to act in concert to better ensure safe digital networks through global cooperation and commitments.

"4.630","Securing the Environment","","As a result of an acceleration of human economic activity since the mid-20th century, scientists say our planet is now entering a period of unprecedented environmental change. Biodiversity, the oceans, fresh water resources, and air quality are all under severe threat, creating the risk of irreversible environmental change. The World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Report has highlighted the strong connections that exist between the ineffective management of the global environmental commons and economic and other risks. The degradation of the environment not only poses risks to be dealt with in the future - it is already affecting human health and well-being, and creating negative economic feedback. Unusual precipitation amounts, for example, a greater likelihood of extreme storms, rising sea levels, coastal inundation, and heatwaves are now directly affecting our security, economic well-being, and health. In 2017, the world experienced 710 geophysical, meteorological, hydrological, and climatological “natural loss events,” or catastrophes, which was almost triple the number that had occurred in 1980. These events caused roughly $330 billion in damage, of which less than half was insured. They also displaced 23 million people from their homes. About 91% of the global population lives in places that fail to meet World Health Organization air quality guidelines, and the Lancet Commission (an initiative started by the medical journal The Lancet, the Global Alliance on Health and Pollution, and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai) has found that roughly 7 million people die annually from exposure to air pollution - equal to roughly one in eight global deaths every year. In addition, water scarcity is already a reality for 1.9 billion people around the world, hindering human health, food production, and energy generation. In the face of these challenges, we need to redesign systems and business models to better reflect and manage the links between our environments, societies, and economies.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.123"

Other indicators reflect a better performance: homicide rate, where it has a progress score of 85.20 that results in a rank of 89th out of 140 countries; and in terms of the incidence of terrorism where it has a progress score of 87.00 that results in a rank of 125th out of 140 countries.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","['1.91', '1.126']"
"4.632","Security and Conflict","","The Fourth Industrial Revolution will dramatically affect the scale and character of conflict. Already, distinctions between war and peace, and between combatants and non-combatants, are becoming blurred. Meanwhile new technologies are making the battlefield both local and global. Groups such as the Islamic State may physically operate in defined areas, but can recruit fighters from hundreds of different countries, largely through social media. Modern conflict is increasingly hybrid in nature, combining traditional battlefield techniques with elements previously associated with armed, non-state actors; the internet is becoming as much a theatre of engagement as land, sea, and air. It is inevitable that future conflict will include an online dimension, as combatants disrupt, confuse, and destroy communications and decision-making capabilities. This will not only lower the threshold of what constitutes war, but will also blur the distinction between war and peace; any network or connected device, from military systems to electricity grids, can be hacked and attacked. The traditional concept of an adversary is also affected. You may have far less certainty about who is attacking you, or even if you have been attacked at all. Autonomous warfare involving the deployment of military robots and artificial intelligence-powered weaponry will play a transformative role. The ocean floor and space are also likely to become increasingly militarized, as more actors, both government and commercial in nature, gain an ability to launch satellites and mobilize unmanned, underwater vehicles capable of disrupting communications. Criminal gangs are already using off-the-shelf drones to spy on and attack rivals. Autonomous weapons that are capable of identifying targets and deciding to open fire without human intervention will become increasingly feasible; while neurotechnologies that can interact with a human brain are currently being employed to solve medical problems, in the future they could have military uses. A computer system attached to brain tissue could enable a paralysed patient to control a robotic limb, and it could also be used to direct a bionic soldier. Another possible scenario: brain devices for treating Alzheimer’s could be strategically implanted in soldiers in order to erase memories, or create new ones. Governing security and warfare in the Fourth Industrial Revolution is as complex as the technologies that are driving the revolution forward. Concerned stakeholders will need to cooperate in new and more comprehensive ways in order to control potentially damaging developments. Ideally, this can be done without impeding innovation and economic growth.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.55"
"4.633","Security and Violence","","Latin America and the Caribbean make up the most violent region in the world, home to just 9% of the global population but about one third of all homicides, according to a report published by the Inter-American Development Bank in 2018. As of 2015, the region had a homicide rate of 24 per 100,000 that was four times the global average, according to the report. A 2017 study published by the IDB estimated that the direct costs of crime in Latin American countries (including losses for victims, the loss of income for prisoners, private spending on corporate and household security, and public spending on police, prisons and criminal justice systems) equalled an average of 3% of GDP - or twice what the average cost is in developed countries. Issues including organized crime, drug trafficking, money laundering, and impunity on the part of corrupt officials have not been tackled, as urban populations continue to grow. According to the United Nations Population Division, 80% of the Latin American and Caribbean population lived in cities as of 2014, which is expected to increase to 85% by 2030. Relatively high rates of youth unemployment contribute to increased crime. According to the Igarapé Institute, as of 2016, a 1% increase in unemployment among men in Brazil contributed to a 2.1% increase in the murder rate, for example. The same institute reported in 2016 that roughly 13% of the young people in Latin America and the Caribbean were unemployed, or nearly three times the percentage for adults. Those young people who are employed are largely working in the informal, unregulated economy. This means that more than 20 million young people in the region are part of the so-called “neither-nor” generation: neither enrolled in formal education or training, nor employed. Organized crime and drug trafficking particularly affect parts of Central America and Mexico, where poverty and a lack of opportunity mean that young people more easily slip into these illicit activities. In Venezuela social and political unrest have spiked and are undermining security, while other countries such as Brazil have seen some related improvement - but may be in danger, in light of economic downturns and increased unemployment.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.92"
"4.634","Security and Violence in Mexico","","Since the beginning of the Mexican government’s so-called war on drugs in 2006, the country has experienced a severe uptick in violence and suffered from a wide-ranging security crisis, according to a report published by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. The proximity and size of the consumer market in the US - the main destination for narcotics in the region - has made Mexico both a place of origin and a transit route. This has triggered widespread violence, particularly in cities along Mexico’s northern border. As a consequence of the violence, the military has played a prominent role in seeking to maintain public security and confront organized crime - undercutting an already fragile institutional framework for combating illicit activity by spreading further violence (in 2018, homicides in the country rose by more than 15% compared with the prior year, to a record 33,341, according to the country’s Secretariat of Security and Citizen Protection). This increased violence has spawned human rights violations such as denying the accused access to justice, forced disappearances, and threats made against both human rights defenders and journalists. Mexico ranked 147th out of 180 countries in the 2018 World Press Freedom Index. Drug-related violence has had a direct effect on Mexico’s economy. A 2013 Inter-American Development Bank working paper on the economic consequences of drug violence in Mexico noted that between 2002 and 2010, an increase of 10 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants led to a two-percentage-point reduction in employment over the same period at the municipal level. It also led to a 1.5% increase in unemployment, a nearly 0.4% decline in business ownership, and a 1.2% decline in wages. In 2018, the overall economic impact of violence in the country rose by 10% compared with the prior year, to the equivalent of about $268 billion, according to a report published in 2019 by the Institute for Economics and Peace. That was equal to 24% of Mexico’s GDP, according to the report, and on a per person basis amounted to roughly 41,000 pesos - or more than five times the average monthly salary of a Mexican worker. The government now faces the daunting task of breaking the cycle of official and criminal impunity, by effectively investigating, processing, and sanctioning those responsible for human rights violations and organized crime.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.96"
"4.635","Security in Nigeria","","While Boko Haram terrorists have been somewhat curtailed, other groups have been kidnapping, robbing, and marauding at a rate that poses a serious threat to Nigeria’s social fabric and economy. In particular, nomadic Fulani herdsmen who have clashed with mostly Christian farmers, and Niger Delta militants, threaten both the country’s unity and two key sectors of its economy: oil and gas, and agriculture. Violence between the herdsmen and farmers killed more than 1,300 people during the first half of 2018, according to a report published by the International Crisis Group, and has evolved from spontaneous provocations to deadlier, planned attacks. Meanwhile the Niger Delta militants have destroyed oil pipelines and facilities; during some months in 2016, production capacity fell from a projected 2.2 million barrels of crude oil a day to just 800,000 as a result. This destruction has cut into government revenue, and unsettled potential foreign and local investors. One widely-acknowledged reason for the persistent threat of violence is the longstanding exploitation of oil-producing communities, by both the government and companies. While agencies such as the Niger Delta Development Commission have been formed to address development problems in the region, their impact has so far been limited (and sometimes mired in corruption and mismanagement). In search of food and water for their cattle, the nomadic Fulani herdsmen move from the arid north to the south during the dry season. They lack designated grazing areas, and their clashes with local farmers often lead to property destruction and death. The increased frequency of these attacks has led to a widely-held perception that the government is too weak or indifferent to deal with the problem. This has led to calls for the transfer of some government responsibilities, such as internal security, from the federal government to the regions. The inadequate number of security officers for a country of nearly 200 million people is a major constraint; according to Nigeria Police Force, the country has about one police officer for every 538 Nigerians. It is not just the economy that is at risk - the unity of the country is at stake. Ways to best address the problem include more focused and sustainable development of the Niger Delta, more appropriate legislation and enforcement for the cattle ranching, greater education and employment opportunities for young people, more security personnel, and a strengthening of the legal system.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.101"
"4.636","Security of Things","","The so-called Internet of Things ties everything together, from our cars to our phones, to our medical devices and our houses, through internet connectivity. As devices more deeply penetrate our lives, we face new privacy and security vulnerabilities. With so much data being created, transferred and analysed, questions about consumer consent, compensation, and hidden costs must be addressed. The research firm Gartner has estimated that the total number of connected “things” will more than double to 20.4 billion by 2020 from 8.4 billion in 2017, while security spending related to the Internet of Things will reach $1.5 billion in 2018, a 28% increase compared with the prior year. The proliferation of related devices brings educational and other benefits, but also creates security concerns and raises ethical questions - such as, for example, to what degree insurance companies should be able to use personal biometric data to calculate premiums, particularly from unconsenting customers. Even Barbie Dolls now collect and analyse data. In 2015, the toy company Mattel released a Wi-Fi connected ""Hello Barbie"" doll that uses speech-recognition software and progressive learning features to “talk.” As developers have sought to meet the growing demand for the Internet of Things, they have failed to adequately provide security and protect customer privacy. This will become an immense problem, as manufacturers depend on accurate shipping information, militaries depend on maintaining full control of armed drones, and patients depend on properly functioning, wireless insulin pumps. All could put privacy, money and lives at risk. When it comes to privacy, for example, the rules governing how customers can be treated by companies, based on personal characteristics, need to be more clearly defined; clear consent, information, and possibly even compensation should be exchanged. In terms of manufacturing, privacy and security must be implemented as fundamental features, as devices are designed. In 2016, Dyn, one of a number of DNS providers that enable the basic infrastructure of the internet, was attacked by thousands of compromised Internet of Things devices - resulting in downtime for many major websites in Europe and North America. Not only was this attack massive in terms of scale and impact, it was also notable for the ease with which it was mounted, as it only utilized a fraction of the total number of devices that had been compromised.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.38"
"4.637","Self-driving Cars","","Self-driving vehicles will save lives. More than 90% of crashes can be tied to human choice or error (as opposed to vehicle malfunction or an environmental factor), according to the results of a US National Motor Vehicle Crash Causation Survey published in 2015. The use of intelligent, self-driving car technology could therefore result in 90% fewer road accidents, according to the consultancy BCG. Self-driving vehicle technology could also lead to a 40% improvement in fuel economy, according to a study published by BCG and the World Economic Forum in 2014. In addition, self-driving vehicles could help elderly populations remain mobile, which may become more important due to demographic shifts; the number of people in the world aged 60 or above is expected to more than double between 2017 and 2050, from 962 million to 2.1 billion, according to the United Nations. Self-driving vehicles are already being put to the test around the world. Their adoption will require a large-scale re-purposing of urban space, including parking areas and traffic lanes. However, challenges related to legislation, cyber-risk, liability issues, infrastructure and technology are slowing their rate of commercialization. Increasingly autonomous transportation of people and goods will have major ramifications for employment and job skill requirements. Nearly 3% of all workers in the US are employed in driving occupations, which are generally deemed good jobs because they keep people above the poverty line, according to Stick Shift, a report published by the Center for Global Policy Solutions in 2017. More than 1.5 million people were employed as drivers in the road haulage sector in 19 European countries surveyed in a study produced in 2015 for the European Parliament, while in the US, there are about 3.5 million truck drivers, according to the American Trucking Associations. All are in danger of having their livelihoods fundamentally altered.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.15"
"4.638","Setting the Financial Rules","","The advent of new laws and regulations can sometimes benefit financial firms; the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, for example, which was passed in 2017, meant that net income for the US banking industry increased by $12.1 billion in 2018 compared with the prior year, rather than increasing by just $5.6 billion (according to a report published by Deloitte). However, other new rules place significant requirements on banks. The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, which went into effect in 2018, has had a significant impact on banks; it requires them (and other companies) to be transparent with clients about what personal data they are collecting and why, and to delete that data when a client moves on to another bank. They face fines equal to as much as 4% of their global revenue for any breaches. As more banks seek to outsource IT management (as a means to cut costs), that exposes more of their client data to third parties - and elevates risk of a GDPR breach. In addition, the EU’s Revised Payment Service Directive, or PSD2, creates new competitive challenges, by enabling companies that do not traditionally provide financial services to do so. So-called crypto-assets, or digital currencies like Bitcoin that are protected by cryptography, have stirred speculation about their viability for everyday financial transactions (while also stirring simple speculation; the price of Bitcoin fell by roughly 70% during 2018, after rising by nearly 1,400% in 2017). The growth in interest in crypto-assets has spurred regulators to take a closer look at related trading and financing. The Financial Stability Board said in 2018 that “vigilant monitoring” of crypto-assets is needed, in light of the speed at which the market has developed. Some regulators have taken a flexible approach; Switzerland allows crypto-related startups to take in up to 100 million francs in deposits before they require a banking license, for example. When it comes to regulating individual banks, Switzerland is an example of a relatively active regulator (its probes have related to everything from alleged FIFA corruption to the Petrobras scandal). In the US, the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul after the financial crisis was meant to move away from microprudential supervision of individual banks, to a macroprudential approach aimed at broader stability; the Trump administration has since sought to ease some aspects of Dodd-Frank.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.52"
"4.639","Shaping Societies","","Mobile chat applications like WhatsApp and social media platforms like Twitter have created tremendous opportunities for people to cooperate, and for businesses to promote themselves. But they have also atomized societies, and made entire communities vulnerable to political manipulation. A need to manage the resulting impact will likely be an enduring policy challenge for government decision-makers. The Fourth Industrial Revolution brings with it opportunities to challenge and change existing assumptions behind policies, cultures, and values. The technology developments driving this industrial era can be designed in ways that either bolster inclusion of the traditionally underrepresented, or exclude vast swathes of the population and amplify existing problems. While sharing economy services ranging from ride-hailing to home repair have outmanoeuvred regulators by leveraging technology, and transformed many thousands of unemployed or under-employed people into small-scale entrepreneurs, this model has also displaced regulated, relatively well-paid and secure jobs in transportation and other sectors. An ability to look beneath the surface of attractive statistics like productivity increases, or increased values for investor portfolios, is therefore a key leadership trait. Leaders must try to assess how it is that major technological advances are shaping societies in less-than-obvious ways, creating potential long-term problems with inequality, driving new or increased consumer needs, producing market inefficiencies, and feeding on policy gaps - in order to help uncover the new and disruptive ideas that can positively shape economies, societies, and governments. One way to encourage people to reconsider values that feed inequality, and to foster a wider, systemic impact is to build a more inclusive global economy. In its World Economic Outlook report published in late 2018, the International Monetary Fund cited rising inequality is among the most prominent obstacles for global economic growth. Low-income countries in particular require greater investment in physical infrastructure, and an enabling environment for competition and trade, according to the report. A willingness on the part of both private sector and public sector leaders to engage with actors who have differing views on these issues is critical in the midst of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, which demands careful, consensus-based responses to best shape governance in a way that takes diverse values into account.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.93"
"4.640","Shifting Demographics and Lifestyles","","People are both living longer, and suffering more dramatically from the effects of their bad habits. The world’s current population of 7.6 billion is expected to increase to 8.6 billion by 2030 - and then jump to 9.8 billion by 2050, according to the United Nations’ 2017 revision of The World Population Prospects. Meanwhile increasing life expectancy will lead to a doubling of people in the world who are at least 60 years of age or older by 2050, and then a tripling of that age group fifty years after that. Much of this population expansion will be the result of reductions in mortality, both from infectious disease and for those under five years old. However, it is being offset by the rise of non-communicable diseases, which are often linked to unhealthy behaviour as people age. The World Health Organization has reported that as of 2015, these diseases accounted for 70% of all deaths worldwide, and three quarters of them occurred in low- and middle-income countries. Nearly half of non-communicable, disease-related deaths in these countries occur before the age of 70, and are therefore considered premature - and the majority result from cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes and cancer stemming from tobacco use, excessive alcohol use, poor diet, and a lack of physical activity. The health care costs and reduced productivity associated with these non-communicable diseases force millions of people into poverty every year, and stifle development in vulnerable regions. Adequately responding to the twin challenges of these diseases and ageing populations, not to mention increases in mental health disorders and violence, will require major changes to health care systems, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Primary prevention, detection, screening, and treatment of non-communicable diseases, and palliative care for the terminally ill, are all often missing from health systems in these countries, which are more often designed to respond to acute infections. Potential low-cost solutions for reducing risk factors (such as comprehensive control of tobacco products) exist for both governments and the private sector. Innovative partnerships across sectors including health, finance, transportation, education, and agriculture will be required.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.69"
"4.641","Shifting Demographics, Growing Wealth","","The world’s emerging market and developing economies accounted for more than 59% of global GDP by late 2018, up from about 36% in 1988, according to data published by the International Monetary Fund. Over that same period, advanced economies saw their contributions to global GDP slip to about 41% of the total from roughly 64%, according to the data. China has been on pace to overtake the US as the world’s biggest economy by 2030, according to an analysis published by HSBC in 2018, and there are abundant examples of other fast-growing emerging markets; the five fastest-growing economies in 2018 were Dominica (with 8.8% annual GDP growth), India, Bhutan, Anguilla, and Ethiopia. As developing economies expand, there are implications for global monetary policy and international governance. For example, UBS published research in mid-2018 noting that because China had been tightening monetary policy for more than a year, it was having the knock-on effect of slowing global growth - a dynamic that other monetary policy-makers would likely have to contend with. China’s development of the Asian Infrastructure Bank and New Development Bank has meanwhile raised questions about the future relevance of the World Bank.      China is now number two in the world when it comes to number of dollar millionaires, (behind the US, and ahead of Japan), and is also second in terms of ultra-high net worth individuals, according to a report published in 2018 by Credit Suisse. When it comes to the middle class China also dominates, according to the report; among people endowed with “mid-range” wealth, or a net worth between $10,000 and $100,000, China accounted for nearly half the total global population. The growing global middle class, fuelled by emerging economies, is changing the ways that trade is conducted and goods are sold. It is also shifting the focus of global banks. Dozens of foreign banks have begun operating in China, in hopes of tapping into the biggest consumer and retail banking market in the world. However, they maintain relatively few branches there, and are subjected to significant financial regulations and capital controls that limit their ability to fund their operations from abroad.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.52"
"4.642","Shifting Ocean Governance","","The oceans have always been difficult to govern; they cover 90% of the habitable space on the Earth, creating an immense, supranational domain with unique regulatory challenges. Unlike most natural assets on land, many ocean resources (such as the bluefin tuna that is prized for sushi) regularly swim across jurisdictional boundaries. In addition, damage incurred within one nation’s jurisdiction (like plastic pollution) can impact nations many thousands of kilometres away. Meanwhile climate change is driving seafood stocks towards the planet’s poles, to escape warming waters. This can create worrisome volatility in less-developed regions - as fish travel out of the reach of countries that need them most. Unfortunately, policies that can properly address these issues have been deferred. Two thirds of the oceans are on the high seas, or outside of the jurisdiction of any single country. The United Nations has committed to developing a first-of-its-kind, legally-binding treaty to better manage biodiversity and resources on the high seas by 2020. If it is successfully implemented, this could be a significant boon for ocean biodiversity. The cross-border migration of valuable seafood has the potential to not only deprive developing economies of resources, but also spur regional conflict. Research published in the journal Science in 2018 suggested that as many as 70 countries will see new fish stocks in their national waters by the year 2100, as a result of climate change. New international agreements are needed to govern the sharing of fishery resources, and to prevent countries from overharvesting stocks when they realize their assets are migrating beyond their borders. One positive development in the world of ocean governance has been the establishment of marine protected areas. These can buy time for at-risk ecosystems to better adapt to climate change. However, based on a review of 144 studies, researchers at the University of York have concluded that about 30% of the oceans would need to be placed within protected areas in order to meet ocean health management goals - though just over 7% is currently protected. The United Kingdom has protected an area of ocean larger than the country’s own land mass, and Chile, the US, and Kiribati have established protected areas that are collectively larger than Italy - now, other countries need to catch up.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.103"
"4.643","Shifting Trade Environment","","A belief in free trade is central to the European Union, which derives much of its strength and stability from trade relationships. Economic relationships formed the foundation on which the union was based; by linking European means of production it was hoped that war between European states would no longer be an option. As of 2016, intra-European trade in goods was valued at €3.1 billion, while trade between Europe and external countries was valued at just €1.8 billion, according to European Commission figures. More than on any other issue, the EU has a single voice when it comes to trade; it represents member states at the World Trade Organization, negotiates free trade agreements, and regulates tariffs. The EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), and a formerly planned EU-US Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) point to EU trade priorities. However, US President Donald Trump’s decision in 2018 to announce the imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminium from the EU cast a shadow over longstanding trade relations between allies. The EU has existing free trade agreements with Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, Japan, Mercosur (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) and Mexico.  As free trade increasingly comes under attack in the Western world, most concerning for the EU is the current US administration’s anti-free trade stance. Many of President Trump’s supporters have designated globalization as a prime enemy, and the president has frequently spoken out against free trade. EU officials have brought a case against the US's use of a national-security justification for steel and aluminum tariffs to the WTO. As the US under the Trump administration is unlikely to bow to a WTO ruling, however, a trade war with the EU could be on the horizon. Even within the EU, belief in free trade is weakening, as it is challenged by populists and as unions prove to be unable to soften the blow of globalization for workers. The TTIP between the EU and the US had already faced considerable criticism within Europe before the Trump administration decided to not pursue it. Reconciling increased public criticism of free trade with the demands of globalization will be a key challenge for the EU in the future.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.50"
"4.644","Shrinking Space for Civil Society","","In many parts of the world, legal systems have been used to stifle dissent, and prevent members of civil society from speaking out on issues and mobilizing constituents. When civil society organizations question policy implications, or undertake advocacy to directly influence government action, they tend to face challenges to their legitimacy. That in turn can have implications for the private sector. In Turkey, the non-governmental organization Freedom House has noted that since 2013, many critics of the government have been subjected to intrusive tax and regulatory inspections, and companies in the country associated with the outlawed Gülen movement have been confiscated - particularly following an attempted coup in 2016. According to media reports, negative perceptions of the Turkish government’s ability to balance its authority with the effective management of the economy have hurt the value of the country’s currency, with the lira falling to record lows compared with the US dollar during 2018. Venezuela has faced similar issues, according to Freedom House, which noted in its 2018 Freedom in the World report that property rights in the country have been affected by price controls and nationalizations, and politicized hiring within state-owned enterprises is common. A robust civil society is usually an indicator of a correspondingly healthy business environment, with greater transparency, lower levels of corruption, and more robust rule of law. That’s because a vocal civil society can be a barometer of a government’s confidence and stability - which is likely important for businesses looking to invest in a particular region or country. The economic effects of squelching civil society can be far-reaching, and dramatic. According to blog post published by the American think tank the Center for Strategic & International Studies in 2017, Hungary’s government has moved in recent years to diminish the independence of democratic institutions like the media and the judiciary, as a means of solidifying control. During the same period, Hungary’s regional economic competitiveness has declined, according to a report published by the US Department of State’s Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs in 2017. In industries including media and retail, unpredictable regulatory policies in Hungary have favoured national and government-linked companies, according to the report, while the Hungarian government’s withdrawal from the transparency-focused Open Government Partnership has raised concerns, and its strong anti-migrant rhetoric has made it more difficult for Hungarian subsidiaries of US multinationals to obtain approval for new investment in the country.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.33"
"4.645","Skill Building for Infrastructure","","Delivering infrastructure may be vital for economic growth and improving standards of living, but it is being hindered by a talent shortage. The gap between the investment in infrastructure that the world needs, and what is actually being invested, is projected to grow from about $500 billion per year in 2020 to $800 billion just twenty years later; much of that lag results from a lack of appropriate skills in both developed and developing economies. According to a report published by the African Development Bank in 2018, most pension funds in Africa lack the technical skills to assess complicated infrastructure projects, for example, and public-private partnership agreements are often poorly structured and drafted due to a lack of relevant skills among government employees. In developed economies, companies are finding it challenging to attract talent, in particular to the engineering and construction field. Companies that develop infrastructure are often perceived as innovation laggards in a world where tech and finance have become more prominent. According to a report published in 2017 by the construction company Kier Group in the United Kingdom, construction, development, and related services are all having trouble attracting people to fields perceived as muddy, manual, male dominated, poorly paid, and non-academic. To help developing economies build the skills base they need to work with international partners and deliver infrastructure projects, programs have been developed recently including the Africa Infrastructure Fellowship Programme, which is led by the World Economic Forum, the Global Infrastructure Hub, which was created by the G20, and Meridiam, which trains African civil servants on public procurement best practices. In developed economies, the private sector has taken the lead. AECOM, one of the world’s largest engineering firms, said in a report published in 2018 that one quarter of the “civil infrastructure decision makers” in North America that it surveyed cited skills and talent shortages as obstacles to progress, and one fifth of those surveyed said difficulty finding the right talent caused major delays. In response, the company created its “Skills 2030” manifesto to try to help spur industry-wide change, disrupt traditional management and training practices, and attract the engineers it needs for the future.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.79"
"4.646","Smart and Innovative Cities","","The increased use of technology and data analysis is enabling the development of “smart” cities, and revolutionizing urban settings. The nature of urban transportation and logistics is changing rapidly as a result of the sharing economy, for example, while e-commerce and e-payment systems are shifting more businesses out of brick-and-mortar real estate and into the virtual realm. This phenomenon has triggered the so-called ""retail apocalypse"" in the US, which began roughly a decade ago and has involved record numbers of brick-and-mortar store closures; there were 8,500 store closures in the country during 2017, according to a report published by Cushman & Wakefield, surpassing the number closed during the Great Recession, and closures during 2018 were expected to meet or exceed that level. One key element of smart cities is cashless payments - which bring with them a need for enhanced security and governance. Overall, the general increase in the interactivity of urban services necessitates smart planning that can enable maximum efficiency. Co-working spaces, ubiquitous science and technology parks and “knowledge corridors” will likely become the norm for cities everywhere. The increasing speed with which know-how is disseminated via these developments will likely further revolutionize how we think about ways to best enable efficient use of real estate space in the future.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.112"
"4.647","Smarter Infrastructure for Mobility","","Throughout the 20th century, countries focused on the development of physical infrastructure like roads, ports, and railways in order to boost economic development. Now, the focus has shifted to digital infrastructure needs. Still, even as digital and other types of infrastructure are recognized as essential for the movement of people and goods, and for the basic functioning of economies, infrastructure the world over has languished - resulting in a global annual total infrastructure funding gap of close to $800 billion, according to a McKinsey Global Institute report published in 2016. That came even as the world had spent $9.5 trillion (equivalent to 14% of global GDP) during the prior year on infrastructure - primarily related to transportation, social infrastructure like education and healthcare, and real estate, according to a subsequent McKinsey Global Institute report. Transportation alone accounted for nearly $1.1 trillion during the year, according to the subsequent report, and a number of impending technology disruptions promise to shape transportation in ways that cannot yet be predicted, like increased electrification and autonomous vehicles. The better integration of emerging digital infrastructure into the broader infrastructure landscape will be key for developing smart and sustainable mobility systems. However, the cost of developing digital infrastructure remains high; the launch of a single satellite can require several hundred million dollars. As a result, there is an increasing need to attract more private funding. In addition to digital infrastructure, there is a corresponding need to develop dependable, basic infrastructure geared for fostering the burgeoning digital economy. According to a report published by the consultancy BCG, about 3 billion people and organizations were already using the internet every day to shop and interact by 2015. Amazon alone has been the source of hundreds of warehouses, and tens of thousands of delivery vans, and is now estimated to deliver nearly half of the orders made through the site on its own; recent additions to its delivery capability include the rental of dozens of Boeing jets. Amazon’s Prime service in particular, which involves faster and free shipping for members, has spurred an expanded need for infrastructure - and resulted in increased wear and tear.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.62"
"4.648","Social Cohesion","","France has a long history of immigration, beginning in earnest during the second half of the 19th century. Although the size of France's foreign-born population is on par with that of other European countries, it has one of the highest proportions of immigrant descendants. However, French law prohibits the collection of official statistics based on ethnicity - which makes it difficult to draw an accurate picture of the country’s true diversity. While only 25% of French people perceive social cohesion in the country as being strong, according to the Directorate for Research, Studies, Evaluation and Statistics, 93% of citizens report feeling integrated. A joint survey conducted by two national institutes found that the vast majority of the children of immigrants in the country have obtained French citizenship, and demonstrate a strong sense of national identity; yet nearly half of immigrants with French nationality, and one-quarter of the children of immigrants, feel they are not perceived as French. Clearly, diversity has not yet been fully incorporated into the idea of “Frenchness.” The arrival of many thousands of asylum seekers to France since 2015 has turned immigration policy and asylum for migrants into hot political issues. Despite the country’s equality imperative, France granted refugee status to only about 13,000 people in 2017, according to the European Council on Refugees and Exiles, compared with nearly 124,000 for Germany. As a result of growing levels of wealth and income inequality in France, globalization is increasingly perceived as only benefiting the few. According to the French Observatory of Inequalities, a private organization, the richest 10% of the population receive more than 25% of overall income, while half the population enjoys only 8% of the nation’s wealth. The limited possibilities for upward social mobility are increasing tension and weakening social cohesion, which contributed in 2018 to an outpouring of public anger by the gilets jaunes (“yellow vests”) - a broad movement that has successfully opposed some of President Emmanuel Macron’s economic reforms. In order to try to bring together social, political, and economic actors in France to revamp civic participation - and increase local participatory democracy - President Macron announced in early 2019 plans for a “grand debate” on issues like taxes, climate change, and public services. In order to succeed, this approach must take into account rural areas of the country, where significant concerns include gaining better connections to major hubs, access to digital tools, and adequate public and social services. The Russian Federation’s middle class has grown significantly, but much of the recently-created wealth in the country has been unequally distributed. Thanks to greater mobility and connectedness, Russians have increased expectations for their socioeconomic well-being, and there is growing popular discontent with the delivery of public services. Perceived impediments to professional success and restraints on political and press freedoms add to discontent, while also fuelling nationalism and a distrust of outsiders. Some metrics reflect significant improvements for Russian society. Average life expectancy in the country reached 71.9 years in 2016, according to government statistics. That is a significant increase from 67.8 years as of 1992, though still lags behind the European Union average of 83.3 years as of 2015. Other metrics are less encouraging. While the Russian Federation’s birth rate per 1,000 people had been roughly even with its number of deaths per 1,000 people in 2016, for the first half of 2017 the number of deaths per 1,000 people was 12.9, compared with 11.3 births, according to data published by the country's Federal State Statistics Service.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","['1.56', '1.116']"
"4.649","Social Entrepreneurship","","Social enterprises can be non-profits (like Goodwill thrift shops in the US), for-profits (like Ethiopia-based fair trade footwear maker Oliberté), or a hybrid of both. They are entrepreneurial organizations designed to solve problems in innovative ways, and produce benefits that blend positive social and environmental impacts with financial returns. They also try to provide innovative solutions for big, societal problems in a self-sufficient way by using market-based mechanisms - and tend to maximize resources for the greatest possible impact, while placing a social mission at the core of their business. Much like traditional entrepreneurs, social entrepreneurs often have a unique ability to sense and act on opportunities by applying creative thinking, and they can benefit from a tireless determination to create new products, services, and markets. What distinguishes a social entrepreneur is his or her targeting of underserved populations, and their commitment to disrupting the status quo by generating social impact at a grand scale.  Social enterprises deploy a diverse range of models and focus on a variety of different areas. In their 2008 book The Power of Unreasonable People, John Elkington and Pamela Hartigan, founding partners of the consultancy Volans Ventures and leading figures in the field of social innovation, defined several possible models for social enterprises: a Leveraged Non-Profit makes innovative use of financial and other resources in order to respond to social needs; a Hybrid Non-Profit is willing to use profits generated by some activities to sustain other operations that have a social purpose; and a Social Business Venture is set up as a for-profit business designed to spur social change. Because the public sector is the primary provider of social services to the poor, many social entrepreneurs partner with governments in roles such as service providers, providers of technical assistance to public employees while teaching them new skills, and as advocates that help craft new laws and policies. While the field is growing, social entrepreneurs still face significant challenges. They are often plagued by a lack of funding, a shortage of business skills, problems with scalability, and a dearth of supportive regulation. Because their business ideas include bold, novel concepts, investors often assign them a high-risk profile.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.118"
"4.650","Social Fragmentation in Pakistan","","Pakistani society is a blend of cultures, languages, ethnicities, beliefs - and social classes. Since the 1980s, the country has been transformed into a state that values security above all else, in contrast to the vision of Pakistan’s founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah - who sought to establish a people-centric, inclusive welfare state where all are treated as equal citizens. This has led to fragmentation and deprivation. The country’s ruling elite does not seem ready to accept the fact that if society remains fragmented along ethnic, social, economic, gender, and religious lines, it will lead to conflict, social exclusion, and exploitation, often motivated by religion or politics. However, if society is tolerant, and pluralistic in approach, it will be strengthened by greater social cohesion. Social bonds in Pakistan seem weak, as the divide between haves and have-nots has widened. The government’s Economic Survey of Pakistan 2017-18 showed that the country’s poverty rate had declined to 24.3% from 50.4% in 2005-06; however, independent sources suggest the rate is actually much higher than 24.3%, based on the situation on the ground and how poverty is being defined. The exploitation of the poor, and related structural imbalances, sustain social polarization. While the government led by Prime Minister Imran Khan has taken on a reform agenda, the electioneering that led to the formation of the government aggravated fragmentation and sharply divided people along political lines; social media helped to fuel related abuse. Meanwhile religious fanaticism is on the rise, which has damaged the fabric of Pakistani society. More active promotion of inclusion and tolerance could help. To that end, the government in 2018 launched the ”Paigham-e-Pakistan” initiative (“paigham” means “message” in Urdu), condemning all forms of religious extremism and acts of terrorism, and calling on all citizens to be tolerant. It is backed by thousands of religious scholars across the country, in addition to many other stakeholders, and may eventually help to bridge divides based on ethnicity and religion. Ultimately, however, Pakistan needs to build a culture of political tolerance and interfaith harmony from the ground up, and put an end to social deprivation by expanding engagement with, and influence over, society and politics.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.105"
"4.651","Social Impact-Driven Entrepreneurship","","In recent years, there has been a significant increase in social entrepreneurs who are driven by a desire to help the disadvantaged, solve social problems like access to affordable health care, and alleviate poverty. A number of tech-savvy entrepreneurs are applying their skills to business models that can have a positive impact - and in a financially sustainable way. That’s an important new twist on the traditional social enterprise, which largely relied upon charity or public funding. This new class of entrepreneurs is enabled by so-called impact-investors and venture-philanthropists, who apply the discipline of the traditional venture capital investment model, but are also willing to accept lower financial returns in exchange for having an impact. The proliferation of socially-conscious consumers in advanced economies should accelerate the development of social-impact driven entrepreneurship. New organizational forms, such as the so-called ""B Corps"" and ""Benefit Corporations"" that are certified to meet a standard of social and environmental performance and take into account both the financial and social bottom lines, also support this trend. There are thousands of registered benefit corporations in the world, including ice cream maker Ben & Jerry's, and e-commerce website Etsy.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.47"
"4.652","Social Inclusion and Development in Argentina","","Poverty and inequality have continued to be serious problems for Argentina, even after the country enjoyed a significant increase in household income during the first decade of the 21st century. Real median household income in Argentina rose from $4.78 per day in 2001, to $12.35 per day by 2011, according to a 2015 Pew Research Center report. In addition, there was a decrease in the portion of the population with unmet basic human needs from 37% in 2003 to 23.1% in the first half of 2017, according to the Socio-Economic Database for Latin America and the Caribbean. However, the percentage of Argentinians affected by poverty rose slightly in the first half of 2018 compared with the second half of 2017, to 27.3%, according to data from the National Institute of Statistics and Census (INDEC). In addition, income levels for the top 20% of earners in the country have been nearly 10 times higher than those for the bottom 20% - a discrepancy that is more than twice as high as the average for advanced economies, according to a report published by the World Economic Forum. In light of its ongoing issues, and despite the country’s difficult recent fiscal situation (Argentina received an International Monetary Fund bailout in 2018), the country had continued to distinguish itself in terms of progressive social spending - though that may now end in the face of austerity measures, according to an Oxfam report published in late 2018. Argentina was ranked 34th on Oxfam’s 2018 Commitment to Reducing Inequality index for 2018, one notch behind Switzerland, though that did not yet reflect the impact of austerity measures. In spite of Argentina's fiscal situation, its bailout agreement with the IMF does include a social safeguard that guarantees a floor for social spending - which would increase by an equivalent of an additional 0.2% of GDP if socio-economic conditions worsen. As it focuses on poverty reduction, the Argentinean government must also contend with a relatively high rate of youth unemployment (nearly 19%, according to INDEC data). However, it remains unclear how much the government will be able to spend on related mitigation efforts; the IMF has projected that late 2018 would mark a peak for Argentina's government debt level, at the equivalent of 81.2% of GDP.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.11"
"4.653","Social Inclusion in Brazil","","Brazil has made significant progress on reducing poverty and inequality since the beginning of the 2000s. However, the recession that lasted from 2014 to 2016 revealed that many of these social gains cannot be sustained without corresponding productivity growth, and some level of economic dynamism. Also essential: efficient public spending that genuinely improves the quality of public services, and benefits the most vulnerable. In 2017, Brazilian respondents to the Latinobarometer survey ranked “improving social policies and social inclusion” and “ensuring equal opportunities for all” as the two most important development issues for the country. According to data from the country’s National Household Sample Survey compiled by the Institute for Applied Economic Research, the portion of Brazilians living in poverty declined from 35.7% in 2003 to 13.3% in 2014. However, according to a report published by the World Bank in 2018, related progress came to a halt in 2015. Between 2015 and 2016, the mean labour income for the poorest 30% of the population actually decreased, even as it increased for everyone else. Inequality in Brazil decreased significantly between 2000 and 2014 thanks to higher employment rates, higher real wages, and redistributive social assistance programs. According to a World Bank working paper published in 2014, Decomposing the Recent Inequality Decline in Latin America, Brazil’s improvement in labour income had accounted for nearly half of the reduction in inequality up to that point, as measured by the Gini coefficient; meanwhile government policies directed at education, health, and social assistance accounted for much of the improved conditions for Brazilians living in poverty during the period. Recent reductions in labour income, caused by a slowdown in economic growth, may therefore undermine efforts to maintain and advance equality in the country. Bolstering structural elements that can support long-term, sustainable improvements in living standards, such as the quality of education, the amount of household savings and investment, and the allocation of labour and capital markets, will be critical for spurring healthy economic growth and sustainable development.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.26"
"4.654","Social Inclusion in Latin America","","Latin America’s economic growth and public policy-making resulted in considerable social gains from the beginning of the 1990s to 2016; extreme poverty decreased by half, the rate of infant mortality dropped by 65%, and average life expectancy at birth increased by nearly eight years, according to a report published by the Inter-American Development Bank. Income inequality also declined during the period, while primary school attendance became practically universal, the availability of safe water expanded to reach nearly 96% of households in the region, and two-thirds of women of working age began actively participating in the labour market. These positive changes have increased demand for quality products and services, including those that are provided by the public sector. However, the region’s ageing population is threatening the long-promised “demographic bonus” (in the form of large numbers of young people entering the workforce) that once characterized Latin America - and the social security systems meant to support the elderly are becoming a heavy burden for young people paying into them, who often lack economic and employment opportunities. One of the biggest challenges for the coming decade will be to preserve the lingering momentum behind positive social transformation in Latin America, and to do so in a more difficult economic environment - particularly for countries still relying heavily on the export of commodities that have lost value on global markets.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.92"
"4.655","Social Progress in Sri Lanka","","Sri Lanka has made significant economic progress following a long civil war that ended in 2009; the percentage of the country’s population living in extreme poverty fell to 0.7% by 2016, from 3.8% in 2006, according to the World Bank, while the percentage of people living below the national poverty line slipped to 4.1% from 15.2%. However, Sri Lanka has been less successful in addressing regional disparities, and pockets of poverty dot the country. Income inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient, where zero equals perfect equality and 100 is perfect inequality, rose from 32.4 in 1990 to 39.8 in 2016, according to World Bank data. In addition, about 60% of the country’s workforce was employed in the informal, or unregulated, economy as of 2015, according to the Department of Census and Statistics, and the general population is projected to have an unusually large share of over-60-year-olds by 2050 for a developing country. A 2015 United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific report found that only 13% of those over 60 in the country were covered by a social security scheme, while 42% of the working age population was not enrolled in a pension scheme.  As Sri Lanka seeks greater economic growth and technological progress, it will result in increased demand for skilled workers, widened wage gaps, and new sources of inequality. Reforms must be enacted that enable sufficient public funding to improve access to, and the quality of, education, health care, and social protections. An inadequately educated workforce was listed as among the most problematic factors for doing business in the country in the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report 2017-2018, as was poor public health. Attention must also be paid to increasing social harmony by strengthening institutional governance structures, the rule of law, and basic human rights. The World Report 2018 published by Human Rights Watch noted that action had stalled on the country’s pledges to the United Nations Human Rights Council to address accountability and political reconciliation following the civil war. For Sri Lanka, a country with a recent and intense history of socio-political conflict, economic growth that is both inclusive, and sustainable, is essential.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.121"
"4.656","Social Protection","","Adequate safety nets can offer people at least short-term buffers against periods of unemployment, obsolete skills, and the emergence of new forms of work. These protections are critical for ensuring human dignity in the face of large-scale economic and social disruption. Currently, however, only 29% of the world’s population has adequate social security coverage for weathering labour market disruption, according to the International Labour Organization’s World Social Protection Report 2017-2019. The relationship between learning, earning, and working has undergone a major shift during the past decade, and will see further transformation amid the changes brought about by the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Given the wide-scale changes underway, it will be critical to review safety nets where they exist in order to ensure that labour market changes do not worsen levels of inequality - and to better ensure the efficiency and utility of employee benefits, which have generally suffered as workers now switch jobs with greater regularity, and have become more likely to take on part-time gigs. Current systems vary in terms of the ways in which they balance the responsibility for workforce protection between employers and governments. Government-provided social safety nets, where they exist, are often outdated. Employer-based systems for health insurance, unemployment insurance, and retirement savings are likewise not well suited for new modes of work, where workers are no longer closely affiliated with a single employer throughout their careers. Labour market shifts call for more agile and portable social safety nets, which can support workers during career transitions and during moments of need, and which apply equally to those employed in both traditional and new forms of work. People engaged in independent forms of work often have less access to affordable healthcare, family leave, and retirement savings plans, for example - while people with more traditional employment can contribute to benefit accounts with paycheck deductions. The development of new instruments and new incentives could lead to greater related innovation. Critical indicators of the success of these new tools would include the ability to ensure minimum income security and to guarantee human dignity. A key question for many policy-makers looking to reform existing approaches will be how to introduce efficiencies while re-structuring broader, existing benefits systems.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.135"
"4.657","Social Welfare Programs","","In light of increased longevity and declining birth rates, current financial and healthcare systems are no longer relevant or sustainable. Government policies and systems require structural changes, and more opportunities to engage the private sector must be explored. Pension reform is essential; a rapidly aging global population means there will ultimately be more people past traditional retirement age than those still working, threatening the solvency of existing pension models particularly in countries where the official retirement age is not increased. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development report OECD Pensions Outlook 2014, defined benefit pension funds, which guarantee employer-funded amounts at retirement, are exposed to risk because they rely on historical life expectancy calculations that undershoot more recent projections - so accumulated assets will not cover liabilities. For defined contribution pension funds, which rely on employee contributions, assets have also been accumulated based on outdated expectations for longevity. Adjustments to official retirement ages, and a changing conception of retirement, could better reflect reality and address impending shortfalls. In addition, personal pension plans obtained outside of work will likely become increasingly important. Policy-makers play a central role in ensuring financial protection for consumers, as they coordinate with financial institutions to assess the changing retirement landscape. The long-term sustainability of annuity products, in particular, which can help consumers manage longevity risk, must be addressed by providing incentives that encourage appropriate risk management on the part of annuity providers, and consistent parameters to ensure a level playing field. Every country must be committed to increasing financial literacy, and to informing individuals both about public pension systems and tools such as private pension plans. Governments should also address access to quality health care services, and aim to enable everyone to access the medical services and medicines they need without undue financial hardship. This includes access to rehabilitation services, which are becoming increasingly important due to the prevalence of non-communicable diseases among ageing populations. There should be a focus on prevention, not just on treatment, and on serving the most vulnerable populations - which increasingly include older adults. Streamlining and harmonizing regulatory processes can contribute to greater efficiency and help avoid duplication. To better map the sustainability of healthcare systems, governments should work together to identify proven, successful healthcare financing frameworks that can meet the needs of an ageing global society.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.7"
"4.658","Social Welfare Spending","","Concerns linger about the South African government’s ability to effectively administer social welfare programmes - particularly as there is no sign that a heavy public dependence on these programmes will decline any time soon. This, along with an unfavourable economic growth outlook, could means that South Africa will come under increasing strain as it seeks to provide adequate social protection. According to the non-profit fact checking organization Africa Check, the number of social grants disbursed in South Africa increased from an estimated 4 million in 1994 to more than 17 million by February 2017. Social security spending amounted to R165 billion (roughly $11.4 billion) for the 2016-2017 fiscal year, and accounted for around 15% of all government expenditure during the period - a level where it is expected to remain for the next five years. It is questionable whether this level of spending on social welfare is sustainable for the long term. Regardless of their financial cost, grants have had a noticeably positive impact on poverty in South Africa. They have been well targeted at very poor households, with 76% of government spending on social grants received by the poorest 40% of the population. Between 2005 and 2010, more grants for the elderly and child support were added, significantly increasing expenditures for the poor. The child support grant has meanwhile had a positive impact on women’s empowerment in very poor communities (where 96% of beneficiaries are women), as well as on school attendance and access to health care. According to the Development Policy Research Unit (DPRU) at the University of Cape Town, South Africa’s persistent income inequality across households would be even more severe in the absence of social grants; if they were not made available to the poor, income inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient would have been 0.74 in 2010 (where a score of 1.0 equals maximum inequality), instead of the actual figure of 0.70. In addition, during the period between 1995 and 2010, had grants not been available, real household income would have declined significantly. Concerns have been raised about the South African Social Security Agency’s takeover of the distribution of grants from a private service provider. A failure to actively discharge these responsibilities could leave the more than 17 million South Africans who receive social grants, and their households, without necessary government support.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.119"
"4.659","Society and Governance","","The ability of public programs and policies to improve collective well-being and prosperity ultimately depends on how the intended beneficiaries respond. The design of health, safety, financial, education and other public systems and services may benefit from taking into account the psychological traits of the people these systems are meant to be assisting. Past approaches to policy-making often relied too much on financial rewards and punishments, though the behavioural science toolkit has expanded significantly since the early 2000s; it now includes social incentives and so-called “nudges,” or subtle changes in the environment that gently push people to make better decisions, while retaining their freedom of choice. These behavioural tools take into account the fact that decisions do not always result from a purely rational weighing of cost versus benefit, but are instead often influenced by simplistic reasoning, intuition, and social motives. Behavioural designs are often more effective, and less costly, than traditional approaches that rely on financial incentives or persuasion. For example, millions of people in the United Kingdom and the US have increased their retirement savings in response to a simple change in the way certain pension plans are being presented to them. These new “Save More TomorrowTM” plans, developed by behavioural economists Richard H. Thaler and Shlomo Benartzi, have people commit to allocating a portion of future salary increases towards their retirement savings. The sting of these paycheck reductions is dulled, as they only kick in after raises, making people much more willing to agree to them. Behavioural science can also help increase civic participation, by motivating people to volunteer, donate, sign petitions, participate in rallies, interact with their government representatives, and vote. Leveraging people’s sense of identity can increase voter turnout, for example. In a study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2011, researchers demonstrated that when items in a pre-election survey were phrased to invoke the respondent’s identity (by asking, “How important is it to you to be a voter in the upcoming election?” as opposed to, “How important is it to you to vote in the upcoming election?”), respondents expressed greater interest in registering to vote, and were in fact more likely to vote, according to records associated with two state-wide elections in the US. Another study on increasing voter turnout, published in 2010 in Psychological Science, was based on the 2008 US presidential election; it showed that if calls made to potential voters not only encouraged them to vote but also prompted them to make a specific plan for casting their ballot, turnout increased among single-eligible-voter households by 9%. Other ways that the behavioural sciences can inform the design of better-functioning societies include motivating people to pay their taxes, preventing people from dropping out of college, increasing vaccination rates, and promoting recycling and the consumption of healthier food. Further collaboration between behavioural science researchers, governments, and civil society institutions could foster a more successful journey through the Fourth Industrial Revolution.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.20"
"4.660","Soft Power","","The regional upheaval that followed the Arab Spring prompted the UAE to more than double its military spending between 2007 and 2017, or the fastest rate of increase during the period in the world, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. In early 2017, however, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and the Emir of Dubai, launched a “Soft Power Council” - in recognition of the limits of traditional power. In late 2017, the council published a “Soft Power Strategy” that involves efforts to burnish the UAE’s global reputation through investment in education, sports, tourism, culture, art, and science. UAE Deputy Prime Minister Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al Nahyan has suggested that the country’s strong economy and world-class infrastructure could help it to “leapfrog” into a leading global position when it comes to soft power. The opening in 2017 of the Louvre Abu Dhabi (under a 30-year contract with France’s Louvre Museum) made headlines around the world. Two other significant local museum launches are planned: the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi, designed by Frank Gehry, and the Sheikh Zayed National Museum (supported by a 10-year contract with the British Museum). In 2017, the UAE became the world’s top provider of development assistance per capita, by dedicating 1.31% of its total economic output to aid - a significantly higher rate of giving per GDP than those of traditional humanitarian powers like Sweden and Norway. Abu Dhabi and Dubai’s sovereign wealth funds collectively control an estimated $1 trillion in assets around the world, and the country’s financial clout may help it to further project its soft power globally. Meanwhile Dubai is preparing to host Expo 2020, a world fair expected to last for several months and to draw 25 million visitors, while showcasing the UAE as a global hub for technology and innovation and potentially positioning Dubai as a leading cultural centre. Regionally, the UAE has been able to draw the attention of a relatively young population; for several consecutive years, the country has topped the Arab Youth Survey as the most desirable place to live. While the UAE has increased its focus on soft power, however, it is also pursuing more traditional means to develop its geopolitical influence - the country plans to have a spacecraft orbiting Mars by 2021.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.128"
"4.661","South African Governance","","In 1994, following the end of apartheid in South Africa, institutions were established to protect people from government abuse, including the Public Protector, the South African Human Rights Commission, and the Commission for Gender Equality. Between 1948 and 1994, South Africa’s decentralized governance system had been racially-segregated into white local authorities, and black local authorities. White authorities enjoyed a high degree of fiscal autonomy, while black authorities were severely resource-constrained. Post-1994, the central government wanted to provide services in disadvantaged areas, and the resulting strategy involved amalgamating apartheid-era municipal structures in order to benefit black authorities. Overall service delivery has since improved, although backlogs remain - particularly in rural areas. In addition, due to low levels of economic activity in most non-urban areas, these areas rely heavily on federal government transfers. Meanwhile the post-1994 task of transforming state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in South Africa so that services can be provided equally has been difficult. According to a presidential review committee, SOEs accounted for 8.7% the country’s GDP in 2016, or nearly half the amount accounted for by all government services. While SOEs present an opportunity for economic growth, they also face challenges related to corruption - particularly when it comes to procurement. Corruption poses a threat to public trust and sustainable development. Forms of corruption particularly prevalent in South Africa include cronyism, and abuses of both government tender processes and of Black Economic Empowerment policies (designed to redress apartheid era policies). Transparency International's 2018 Corruption Perceptions Index assigned South Africa a score of 43 out of 100 (where zero equals highly corrupt), compared with Botswana’s score of 61 and Sierra Leone’s 30. Former South African Public Protector Thuli Madonsela’s state capture report published in 2016 provided evidence of corruption among senior officials; evidence has shown that private sector companies have been complicit in this corruption, which needs to be addressed through the rule of law. The experience of apartheid has made South African society more in need of a transparent and accountable government than it would be otherwise. Non-profit organizations like Corruption Watch have played a positive role in this regard, along with other civil society organizations and the news media's active coverage of related stories. Better addressing crime that impacts the cost of doing business will be key for South Africa, if it wants to avoid further economic stagnation.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.119"
"4.662","Space Conflict","","As space-based technology becomes increasingly critical, the unwillingness of space powers to play by a common set of rules is a potential source of problems. In 2014, roughly one year after China test fired an anti-satellite missile to the height of geosynchronous orbit, or an altitude of about 30,000 kilometres, the US declassified details about a similar program - and launched a pair of satellites capable of rendezvousing with other satellites at an altitude of about 30,000 kilometres. In late 2018, Russia launched an object perceived by some US officials to be capable of destroying satellites (though some experts are not convinced), and perhaps the most serious possibility of conflict in space arose when the Trump administration announced plans that same year for a ""Space Force"" meant to secure US dominance. The US effort comes as Russia and China are developing an ability to disable or destroy US satellites, and as space becomes a war-fighting domain like land, sea, and air. However, the Space Force is believed to a bad idea, because it could encourage other countries to follow suit, lead to a space arms race, and worsen space debris.  Until recently, questions about the basic rules governing conflict in space could be settled by the relatively few states wealthy enough to have access to space. Now, the situation is more complex; roughly 60 countries have satellites in space, and both low- and high-Earth orbits are brimming with scientific and commercial activity. In 2018, delegates to the UN General Assembly’s First Committee explored new rules to help keep outer space conflict-free; South Africa’s speaker expressed concern about an arms race in space, while Egypt’s representative (speaking for the Arab Group, the African Group, and the Non‑Aligned Movement), said space must not be allowed to turn into another battlefield. In 2018, the US deviated from past practice by voting “no” on all resolutions dealing with space conflict and security adopted by the First Committee (it used to vote for resolutions on transparency and confidence building measures, and abstain from those calling for the prevention of a space arms race). While international cooperation on preventing space conflict has been regressing, since 2016 a team of international experts has been developing the McGill Manual on International Law Applicable to Military Uses of Outer Space (MILAMOS), an effort that may dissuade the use of force and help avoid future conflict (and, potentially, future wars).","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.120"
"4.663","Space Policy and Governance","","The United Nations-initiated Outer Space Treaty, which entered into force in 1967, holds governments responsible for the actions of private entities in space. Many countries have therefore established laws to regulate space-related companies. Those laws have become increasingly important amid a proliferation of firms such as communications satellite developers like Intelsat and Eutelsat, and commercial ventures seeking to explore and exploit space resources. Still, there is a lingering reluctance on the part of governments to develop international, legally-binding rules for space. Instead, governments tend to prefer non-binding agreements - though these generally include imprecise guidelines, and rights and obligations cannot be firmly established through non-binding promises. An all-inclusive, rules-based global space governance system is therefore called for, composed of binding treaties, best practices, and a means to coordinate national regulations and policies - in order to ensure that everyone is aware of their responsibilities.   Outdated regulation is another issue. When the American firm DigitalGlobe was able to capture full-quality images of forest fires through dense smoke in Alberta, Canada in 2016, the company was nonetheless prohibited from providing them to Canadian firefighters - because of a US regulation requiring such images to be degraded before their release to commercial customers. This regulation is a relic from an era when most countries (much less companies) had not yet built Earth observation satellites, and it unnecessarily hinders competition. There is no single, global institution that oversees space-related matters, though it is worth considering whether the UN’s influence should be expanded - or if a new international organization should be created. Without the establishment of international norms, an increasing number of unilateral actions that run contrary to the interests of other countries is possible, similar to the US SPACE Act of 2015, which allows American citizens to explore and exploit space resources, and a similar law that was passed in Luxembourg in 2017. These two actions threaten global governance mechanisms like the Outer Space Treaty, which has been signed by more than 120 countries. During the 2018 session of the Legal Subcommittee of the United Nations Committee on Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, several countries raised concerns that the actions could lead to misunderstanding and devastating conflict.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.120"
"4.664","Spatial Integration","","South Africa’s history of racial segregation and marginalization has resulted in significant, spatially-biased economic disparities. Until the 1990s, there was extensive government intervention in the process of urbanization, including racially discriminatory controls on land ownership and restrictions on access to urban areas for non-white South Africans - who could be forcibly removed. While these restrictions have been lifted, spatial planning in South Africa remains as a remnant of apartheid. The majority of poor, non-white households are in rural areas or on the periphery of cities and economic hubs. These places are characterized by high rates of poverty and unemployment, poor service delivery, and generally poor living conditions. Spatial-based transformation could therefore function as a driver of economic development, and reduce inequality. Although there have been improvements to the country’s spatial issues, significant negative aspects remain. There is a glaring mismatch between where a big part of the labour force lives, and where much of the productive economy is located. In addition, the quality of service delivery is highly uneven, resulting in significant disparities in the quality of life across regions. “Spatial mismatch” refers to a state where large distances separate substantial segments of the labour market (in the case of South Africa, non-white populations) from job opportunities. Workers living far from economic hubs face high transportation costs, and long commute times. South Africa’s relatively poor transportation systems present further challenges, including a lack of safety and reliability. The challenge of spatial mismatch is heightened by a lack of affordable housing in urban centres. According to South Africa’s National Treasury, the limited access in rural areas to basic municipal services such as water, sanitation, and electricity, and the lack of good quality social services such as education and health care, compound the challenges already presented by poverty and unemployment. The provision of more reliable, affordable, safe, and extensive transportation infrastructure will be key for overcoming spatial mismatch. Increased access to affordable housing in and around economics hubs could also improve employment and welfare outcomes for workers and their households. In addition, improving services delivery in rural, peripheral communities could improve welfare outcomes in these areas, specifically in terms of health care and education.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.119"
"4.665","Spurring Growth via Space","","The total value of the space-related industry may grow from roughly $350 billion as of 2018 to about $2.7 trillion during the following 30 years, according to research published by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. This is being made possible by the declining cost of access to space, and by increasing amounts of financing from more than 80 different countries, according to the research. Already, people in virtually every country utilize satellite telecommunications for everything from TV entertainment to emergency communications. In developing countries, satellites provide an essential link to telecommunications network nodes - the important equipment that take the raw data being received and send it along to internet users or TV viewers. They are also a key element in most maritime and aviation communications systems for both civilian and military services, and are vital for safety and navigation - in addition to simple online booking for anyone trying to take a flight or rent a car. Satellite companies such as O3b Networks and OneWeb seek to provide internet connectivity even in remote locations (for companies operating in these places, this can mean better communicating with staff and exchanging information). The growing web of space-based communication is made up of hundreds of high-altitude geosynchronous equatorial orbit satellites, and thousands of low-Earth orbit satellites - in addition to constellations of small satellites that can weigh less than 10 kilograms. According to a 2018 report published by National Sky Research, 6,500 small satellites are expected to be launched by 2027, yielding $37 billion in cumulative revenue. However, it remains challenging to develop cost-effective launch vehicles. India has positioned itself as a low-cost service provider; the Indian Space Research Organization has used a launch vehicle to put hundreds of small satellites including those from other countries into orbit. In 2017, a single launch in India included 104 satellites (103 of them weighed less than 10 kilograms), and most were from Austria, Belgium, Latvia, Lithuania, and Slovakia. The global space industry is also an important catalyst for other industries, like telecommunications, transportation, banking, and mining. As of late 2018, according to the Brookings Institution, for the first time ever more than half of the world’s population had attained at least middle class status - and the space industry played a significant role in making that happen.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.120"
"4.666","Sri Lanka's Digital Transformation","","Sri Lanka is at an early stage of digital transformation. In 2017, the country’s Telecommunications Regulatory Commission reported an internet penetration rate of 27% of the population; meanwhile the think tank Freedom House reported that the smartphone penetration rate as of 2017 was 36%, up from 20% in of 2014. As the country develops its digital potential, it is also fostering a more digitally savvy workforce. Sri Lanka’s adult literacy rate as of 2015 was 92.6%, according to United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) figures. Meanwhile the overall national computer literacy average was 27.1%, according to Department of Census and Statistics figures - and 58.7% for those aged between 15 and 19, which bodes well for the future. The country ranked 63rd out of 139 economies in the World Economic Forum’s Network Readiness Index 2016, ahead of other South Asian peers. The value added to Sri Lanka’s economy from telecommunications activity rose 12% in 2017 compared with 2016, according to the annual report published by the country’s Central Bank. Meanwhile IT programming consultancy and related activities rose 4.2% in 2017, according to the report - a slowdown relative to 7.1% growth in the prior year. Growth in private consumption expenditure on communication in Sri Lanka also slowed in 2017, to 4.4% from 9.8% in the prior year, according to the central bank’s report, though the import volume and value of telecommunication devices increased during 2017, and overall internet connection growth remained roughly steady, at about 20% compared with the prior year. Sri Lanka excels in software development, as well as in information technology-enabled services such as business process outsourcing. In 2017, the country ranked 11th in A.T. Kearney’s Global Services Location Index, which evaluates locations based on financial attractiveness, available talent, and business environment. However, digital transformation also introduces social, political, and economic issues. Now is the ideal time to begin regulating this area in a way that addresses the needs of all stakeholders - including customers and employers. Related, forward-looking policy initiatives include Sri Lanka’s Right to Information Act, implemented in 2017, which enables citizens to access data held by authorities. In addition, e-government digitalization initiatives were commenced in 2018.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.121"
"4.667","Sri Lanka's Trade Competitiveness","","Sri Lanka’s government has sought to better integrate the country into the global economy, due to its limited domestic market of 20 million consumers and modest per capita income. In 2017, Sri Lanka regained a significant trade concession from the European Union, the GSP Plus, which removes import duties on Sri Lankan exports such as textiles in exchange for a commitment to implement international conventions on human rights and labour conditions. The Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement, which was implemented in 2018, covers trade in goods, services, and investment relative to telecommunications, e-commerce, government procurement, competition policy, intellectual property rights, and transparency. Sri Lanka is also negotiating comprehensive trade agreements with India and China, while considering agreements with Bangladesh, Malaysia, South Korea, and Thailand, and a proposed Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement could deepens links to India. These developments have been accompanied by measures to mitigate the adverse effects of trade liberalization, such as the Anti-dumping and Countervailing Duties Act and efforts to deal with import surges. The government has also formulated a New Trade Policy framework, which aims to increase competitiveness. The country’s Board of Investment, an investment promotion agency, is taking steps to accelerate the investment approval process, and improve coordination among government agencies. A comprehensive national export strategy launched in 2017 focuses on sectors including wellness tourism and boat building, and aims to increase Sri Lanka’s value of exports in goods and services to $28 billion by 2022. The Trade Information Portal launched in 2018 collects regulatory information relating to cross-border transactions in one place, while the National Single Window should enable the entry of standardized documents at a single point. These have been developed in order to fulfil Sri Lanka’s commitments under the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA), which came into effect in 2017. The government is also gradually phasing out para tariffs, which are fees charged in addition to tariffs. While the country’s international trade situation is improving, there are still a number of domestic challenges, such as a relatively high cost of production, and a lack of skilled labour.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.121"
"4.668","Sri Lankan Agricultural Reform","","Sri Lanka’s agricultural sector is comprised of a well-developed, export-oriented plantation sector that produces tea, rubber and coconut on medium- and large-sized estates, and a less developed, only partially market-oriented food crop sector that produces rice, vegetables, and fruit via generally small land holdings. Agriculture remains a vital sector for the country’s economy, as it provides income, foreign currencies, food, and essential raw materials. It accounts for nearly a third of all employment in the country, primarily in the production of rice and tea. Agricultural land made up nearly 44% of the country’s total land area as of 2015, according to World Bank data - compared with 60% in India, and 47% in Pakistan - and is the backbone of the rural economy. However, the domestic agricultural sector as a whole is plagued by low productivity, inefficient resource use, food insecurity, poor market linkages, and unsustainable practices, while the plantation sector in particular is in crisis owing to volatile commodity prices and high production costs. In addition, the looming threat of global climate change means that agricultural industry growth should be low-carbon and climate resilient. The government in Sri Lanka is aiming for inclusive and sustainable economic growth, while ensuring food security. The Department of Agriculture’s national food production programme for 2016-2018 consists of promoting the production of rice and other food crops, and home gardening. The government has also initiated programmes for developing the dairy industry, modernizing fisheries, developing agricultural “mega zones” (designed to better integrate smallholder farmers into value chains, and enable them to access larger markets), developing public-private producer partnerships, and modernizing irrigation. The Agriculture Sector Modernization Project for Sri Lanka, a World Bank-funded development scheme, aims to increase agriculture productivity and help the country close the gap between it and South and East Asian peers in terms of developing competitive exports. A number of development initiatives have also been undertaken to mitigate climate risks and enhance resilience in agriculture, and to ensure sustainable food production systems. These include micro irrigation programmes and an index-based agriculture insurance programme (which is different from traditional, loss-based insurance, in that it pays out claims based on environmental conditions measured via satellite).","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.121"
"4.669","Stabilizing Economies, Keeping Protections","","The global financial crisis roughly a decade ago, and Europe’s subsequent debt crisis, abruptly pushed governments around the world into a situation where large parts of their economies and financial systems had to be restructured. This was often done in ways that drew criticism from people who felt their social benefits and protections were being unfairly sacrificed as a result. In Greece, for example, where officials at one point were forced to disclose that the deficit was twice as high as what had previously been announced, controversial austerity measures were implemented beginning in 2010 that slashed government employee salaries and pension payments. According to a study subsequently published by researchers at the University of Portsmouth, for every 1% decline in Greek government spending, there was a 0.43% increase in suicides among men - and more than 500 men had killed themselves solely because of austerity during the early stages of the measures. In addition to financial bailout programs, Greece, like other countries following the financial crisis, also restructured its sovereign debt - that is, it pressed creditors to trade in existing sovereign bonds for new bonds with far lower face value, granting the country much-needed fiscal relief.      Many other countries have pursued sovereign debt restructuring. However, the process has created some controversy, as poorer countries may have difficulty enforcing terms of a restructuring deal on large investors; this can ultimately hinder the ability of these countries to use the process to fully recover financially. In addition, ""vulture” investors can cheaply buy up old bonds that a country is seeking to exchange, and then pursue litigation with that country in hopes of ultimately receiving 100% of the bonds' face value. A restructuring first implemented by Argentina after its sovereign default in 2001 was only fully resolved in 2016, after a lengthy legal battle with investors. In a policy paper published in 2016, the scholars Martin Guzman and Joseph Stiglitz noted that since 1970, more than half of restructuring episodes with private creditors were followed by another restructuring or default within five years. The scholars called for a “soft law regime” to govern sovereign debt restructurings built on United Nations principles, and reliant on social norms and market acceptance rather than legal force. In 2018, Guzman noted in an article published by the Institute for New Economic Thinking that the framework for restructurings remained fraught with perverse incentives.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.111"
"4.670","Stormy Financial Seas","","Almost as soon as voters in the United Kingdom approved a 2016 ballot proposal to leave the European Union, speculation about the resulting impact on the UK’s vaunted financial services industry - not to mention on the global financial system - began in earnest. The financial services industry accounts for about 7% of the UK’s GDP, directly employs more than 1 million people in the country, and contributes a significant portion of overall tax revenue, according to a survey co-published in 2018 by the Association of Foreign Banks. Some foreign banks operating in the UK that participated in the survey reported that the local talent pool had shrunk following the Brexit vote, and that they were receiving fewer applications to work in the country. One quarter of the banks reported spending as much as £2.5 million on Brexit preparations, even as they had a lack of clarity on the ultimate shape of the split. There are also financial issues related to the UK’s trade position post-Brexit to consider; the EU accounted for more than half of UK imports in 2017, and 44% of exports, according to a parliamentary briefing.    Regardless of the eventual outcome of the UK-EU divorce, the unease it has already triggered demonstrates how populism can upend ways that finance, business, trade, and monetary systems are managed. In addition, in several European countries successful populist political movements have questioned retaining the euro. Populist parties have attacked the common currency for destabilizing their country’s public finances (mostly in the North), or for directly causing economic crises (mostly in the South), according to a report published by CESifo Group in 2017; the report noted that in Eastern Europe, even countries that have enjoyed relative economic progress during the past decade, like Hungary and Poland, have seen populists come to power. Meanwhile in the US, Donald Trump, who won election as a populist, has criticized Federal Reserve policy members as they have raised interest rates in a bid to keep the economy on an even keel (raising rates can disrupt stock market gains as they cool an economy). Trump has also expressed a desire to “win” on trade, particularly with China. As they vie geo-economically, countries often seek out technology-based competitive advantages; when it comes to financial technology, for example, China has now surged ahead of the US, with half of the top ten entries in KPMG’s list of the most innovative fintech firms published in 2018.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.52"
"4.671","Strategic Industries","","Countries tend to consider an industry to be strategic either because it is critical for an economy, such as energy, or because it adds a military advantage; examples include the production of materials and technologies used to make stealth aircraft or submarines. When it comes to the strategic use of energy, in the 1970s, for example, oil-rich OPEC nations manipulated global oil supply to pursue foreign policy interests. More recently, developments like fracking have unlocked new sources of energy, curbing OPEC Rare earth elements can be critical for the production of high end technologies, like jet engines or semiconductors - and can therefore also become the subject of geo-strategic gamesmanship. In 2010, it was reported that China had blocked the export of minerals used in hybrid cars and guided missiles to Japan, as a result of a dispute over Tokyo's detention of a Chinese fishing boat captain (Beijing has denied the claim). So-called “dual use” technologies, which are developed for civilian applications but can also be used militarily, have become a concern for public officials wary of related foreign investment. Meanwhile foreign investment in basic infrastructure, like ports or telecommunications networks, is increasingly being subjected to political intervention. European governments, for example, have been divided on the issue of when it is appropriate to block foreign investment from Chinese and Russian investors on the basis of national security. Of course, it is also debated whether or not national security is a genuine motivation in the case of intervention, or if it is being used as cover for more mundane protectionism.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.64"
"4.672","Strongman Politics","","Populism has spread globally. In Latin America, leftist populism has been more widespread, while in Europe right-wing parties have achieved both popularity and significant electoral victories - including in Turkey. Populist governments, regardless of their ideological inspiration, have at least two things in common: an appeal made to “ordinary” voters as opposed to elites, and an effort to exploit problems related to inequality and corruption. Populists also frequently attempt to convince voters that their fight against elites requires a strong leader, and that an erosion of checks and balances is therefore justified. For many observers, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s rise to power in 2002, and the political transformation he has overseen in since then (including in the wake of an attempted coup in 2016), represents this sort of backsliding of democracy (an EU Commission report published in 2019 cited “serious backsliding” on human rights, the rule of law, and economic policy). To be sure, as is the case with other instances of populist transformation, inequality has declined in Turkey as a result (as measured by the Gini coefficient) - but at a cost.   According to Freedom House, Turkey’s “Democracy Score” has consistently decreased since 2010 - and in 2018, the country’s status was changed from “partly free” to “not free” for the first time since Freedom House began its assessments. In 2019, Freedom House said the government’s “authoritarian nature” had been fully consolidated, following the attempted coup - which was itself followed by a 2017 constitutional referendum that saw voters approve a system that increased executive authority. Strongman politics is a common reaction to public frustration with inequality and corruption, and involves the empowerment of elected authorities; in the case of Turkey, this took on a legal form with the referendum, and a resulting shift from a parliamentarian system to one where the president now enjoys greater influence over other state institutions including parliament and the judiciary. In fact, Turkey fits in with a broader global trend towards strongman politics, as evidenced to varying degrees in places like Russia, the Philippines, Hungary, and the US.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.127"
"4.673","Structural Rigidity","","The Republic of Korea (South Korea) is home to a dynamic society and has set a pace of development that is the envy of many other nations. However, further progress is being inhibited by a deeply rooted rigidity, both in terms of socioeconomic structures and mentalities. The bulk of South Korea's economic productivity is highly concentrated within a few large corporations, known as “chaebols,” which has limited the competitive potential of local startups. In addition, the country’s labour market is sharply divided, with unionized, highly-protected workers on one end, and a growing number of more vulnerable workers in non-regulated areas of the economy on the other, which blunts the vitality of the economy and hinders social cohesion. In the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index 2017-2018, South Korea ranks 26th out of 137 economies overall, but 73rd in terms of labour market efficiency. Relative ethnic homogeneity in the country is becoming a source of concern, at a time when openness to diverse new talent and a rethinking of immigration policy could enable greater economic growth. In addition, the country’s ruling elite has been destabilized by controversy; the parliament voted to impeach former President Park Gyun-hye in late 2016, she stepped down in 2017, and in 2018 she received a 24-year prison sentence for abuse of power, bribery and coercion. Now, as the country regains its footing, it must continue to seek to break away from its structural rigidity and embrace new ways of thinking.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.113"
"4.674","Supply Chain Disruption","","Since the advent of the first industrial revolution, manufacturing has spawned global activity that increasingly feeds into layers of dispersed and multi-tiered supply chains. Now, new platform business models are challenging and disrupting these established supply chain structures. These digital platforms connect suppliers, buyers, technology developers, and service providers so they can exchange capacity (like computing power), capabilities, products, and services directly - avoiding any middle men. Amazon’s Amazon Web Services offering, for example, connects vendors directly to on-demand cloud computing services. Amazon Web Services, or AWS, is now one of the company’s fastest-growing businesses; the unit reported 41% net sales growth in the first quarter of 2019 compared with the same period a year earlier, and its customers include Volkswagen and Lyft. Microsoft’s Azure business, a rival to AWS, reported a 73% gain in revenue in the first quarter of 2019.  Platforms enable the gig economy, which includes ride-sharing companies like Lyft and where independent workers who offer up their talents for limited periods and can help address specific production issues. Increased data sharing via platforms has facilitated more open innovation, whereby companies that may have once operated in isolation are tapping into external technology - while also making their own innovation externally available. However, with increased connectivity there are increased cyber risks. High-profile ransomware attacks including LockerGoga (2019), WannaCry (2017) and NotPetya (2017) have targeted industrial firms including Nissan, Mondelez, and many others. In March 2019, a LockerGoga attack on Norwegian aluminium manufacturer Norsk Hydro had such a swift, severe effect on operations that it forced the company to shift its modern factories back to manual operation.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.3"
"4.675","Supply Chain Sustainability","","Businesses are coming under increasing pressure from regulators, shareholders, employees, and customers to make their supply chains more sustainable; environmental aspects merit particular attention in light of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, declared in 2015. The wider societal impacts of supply chains were explored in detail in the World Economic Forum’s 2014 report Beyond Supply Chains, which examined ethical issues related to sourcing, production, distribution, working conditions, impacts on local economies, and the empowerment of decision-makers to meet social and environmental objectives. Many firms’ corporate social responsibility policies now address these subjects, and specifically include supply chain sustainability. Logistics is responsible for significant pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, noise, and accidents. In many countries, the situation has improved. Decades of tightening controls on exhaust emissions from new trucks in North America and Europe substantially improved air quality, for example, though the adoption of such measures in the developing world has been slow (and the US announced plans in April 2018 to ease vehicle-emissions standards). One particularly encouraging sign: globally, the maximum sulphur content permitted in ship fuel will drop from 3.5% to 0.5% in 2020. The decarbonization of logistics will be difficult, because of expected growth in freight traffic and a heavy dependence on fossil fuels. Modelling by the International Transport Forum at the OECD suggests that the total amount of global freight movement may increase three-fold by 2050. Dramatic reductions in the average carbon intensity of logistics will therefore be required, in order to meet the demands of the Paris Agreement signed in 2015. The Science Based Targets initiative, a collaboration between the United Nations Global Compact and other organizations, is helping logistics companies set carbon reduction targets in line with the latest climate science. Some companies are setting ambitious targets; DHL, for example, aims to be carbon neutral by 2050. Meanwhile the International Maritime Organization aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping in half between 2008 and 2050. The greening of supply chains can be achieved in many ways: by rationalizing patterns of freight movement, improving the energy efficiency of freight vehicles, switching freight to lower-carbon modes, raising vehicle load factors, and using cleaner energy sources. Many of these measures can be justified on economic as well as environmental grounds - though they alone are unlikely to deliver the cuts in emissions needed over the next few decades.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.122"
"4.676","Supply Risk and Recovery","","Supply chains are vulnerable to a broad range of threats, including extreme weather, cyberattack, political and military crises, and bankruptcies. A 2017 survey conducted by the Business Continuity Institute (BCI) found that 65% of responding companies had had at least one supply chain disruption during the previous year, with one quarter incurring a loss of over €1 million from a single incident. The vulnerability of supply chains has been highlighted by major incidents such as the collapse of Hanjin Shipping in 2016, which stranded $14 billion worth of cargo on its vessels, the Petya cyberattack in 2017, which severely disrupted the operations of shipping giant Maersk and the TNT division of delivery firm FedEx, and the multiple hurricanes that hit the US in 2017 causing an estimated $200 billion in damage. Ironically, the susceptibility of supply chains has been heightened by what have long been considered good business practices. The single sourcing of supplies, inventory centralization, just-in-time replenishment, and the concentration of freight traffic at hub ports and airports all improve economic performance, but also create greater risk exposure and lower resilience. As a result of the globalization of supply chains and the tighter coupling of logistical processes, the damaging effects of disruptions now spread much further and faster than before - and increasingly prevalent security threats are having a broader impact. The human cost of supply chain disruption can also be high. In addition to the direct loss of life during natural disasters and military conflicts, death and suffering can occur when supply chains relied upon to deliver medical and essential supplies are fractured. Humanitarian-related logistics activity is steadily increasing, partly in an effort to improve the living conditions of those who have been geographically displaced. In the corporate world, the management of supply chain risk is being given greater priority. Risk auditing and business continuity planning are now widespread, particularly among larger companies. 74% of the companies that responded to BCI’s 2017 survey had business continuity arrangements in place for their supply chains. In some countries, publicly-traded companies have a regulatory obligation to monitor and report business risk. However, strategic risk is not always adequately addressed at an operational level - and there is little evidence that companies are effectively reversing the long-term trends that have made their supply chains more vulnerable.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.122"
"4.677","Sustainability","","Rampant growth in global tourism has had a negative impact on the environment, which must be mitigated in order to both help address the effects of climate change and to ensure the industry’s long term sustainability. Air travel presents some of the most pressing related challenges - the total number of air travellers is expected to jump to 7.8 billion by 2036, from about 4 billion in 2017, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), producing a related increase in particulates contributing to climate change. According to the United Nations Environment Programme, the tourism industry overuses water resources on things like swimming pools and golf courses, resulting in shortages and the generation of greater volumes of waste water. The number of cruise ship passengers is projected to grow to more than 25 million by 2020 (from about 18 million as of 2010), according to the organization TourismConcern - which also reported that older vessels used for cruise tourism generate more greenhouse gas emissions per capita than other forms of travel, as they power on-board facilities such as laundry, refrigeration and air conditioning.  The travel and tourism industry is working to find solutions to reduce its oil dependency, by improving aircraft and airport operations, aircraft design, and its use of materials - and by considering alternative sources of energy. The IATA has set targets to reduce carbon emissions by 2050 to half of what they were in 2005, and to build zero-emissions aircraft by 2057 (based on a 50-year goal set in 2007). The Air Transport Action Group, a coalition of industry organizations and companies, has committed to an annual average improvement in fuel efficiency of 1.5% between 2009 and 2020, and to stabilizing net aviation emissions in 2020. Meanwhile the International Tourism Partnership (ITP) has launched the Hotel Carbon Measurement Initiative, a tool to measure and report on carbon emissions. The ITP estimates that the hotel industry must reduce its carbon emissions by 66% by 2030, in order to contribute to the widely-held goal of limiting global temperature increase to below 2°C higher than pre-industrial levels.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.16"
"4.678","Sustainability and Behaviour Change","","The need for more sustainable use of the planet’s resources calls for a long-term, global perspective. Humans often struggle to act in their own future selves’ best interests, or in the interests of those outside of their physical vicinity. They may aspire to consume less, save more energy and water, and purchase more sustainable products, but they nonetheless often fall back on bad habits and preferences. Traditional approaches to tackling this so-called “intention-behaviour gap” often fail. Simply informing people about the importance of sustainability is often not enough to affect their behaviour, as decision-making is often guided by more ephemeral influences like mood, short-term desire, or habit. More often than not, people are also lazy, in the sense that they do not consider all available information when making decisions, or prefer convenient and accessible options over rational ones. To circumvent this, behavioural scientists investigate not only how persuasion can be more effective, but also how subtle changes to one’s environment, or so-called “nudges,” can make it easier for people to act in line with their aspirations. Such nudges always allow for the retention of consumers’ freedom of choice. For example, the Flemish government in Belgium was able to increase sales of local regional and seasonal foods by up to 30% simply by placing them at eye level for shoppers. Meanwhile presenting smaller portions of meat next to larger sizes resulted in a decrease of meat purchases by 20%. Defaults can also work as powerful nudges; a 2008 study by researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Human Development and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology published in the Journal of Environmental Psychology showed that the proportion of people choosing a green, sustainable energy source over a less expensive, less sustainable source like coal can be substantially increased by simply making the green option the default in a registration form. People do not like deviating from what is displayed as the default, possibly because they think it indicates a recommendation, or prevailing norm. Information about established norms is also effective in nudging people to behave more sustainably. A 2008 study published in the Journal of Consumer Research described guests at a US hotel re-using their towels more frequently, if a sign informed them that the majority of guests in the same room had re-used their towels. Meanwhile a 2011 study published in the Journal of Public Economics showed that providing US citizens with monthly reports about their energy consumption, alongside comparisons to that of their neighbours, reduced their energy consumption by about 2% relative to a baseline. Even small, behaviourally-informed changes to the environments in which we make our decisions, or to the narratives we use to make sense of the world around us, can help us better act in accordance with the planet’s best interests.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.20"
"4.679","Sustainability of Social Protection","","By the year 2050, the portion of the global population aged 65 or older will double from 10% to 20%, and about 80% of the elderly will be living in low-income countries, according to figures published by the World Bank in 2018. Yet, only about one third of the collective population in these low-income countries currently has formal retirement income, according to the figures. The dynamic created by an ageing population and a lack of available retirement funding is also concerning in developed countries; about half of the workforce in private industry in the US has no private pension coverage, while there will only be 2.2 active workers for each Social Security beneficiary by 2035, down from 2.8 workers currently, according to a bulletin published by the Social Security Administration. China’s population ageing problem is even more severe than those in other countries, due to its one-child policy which was discontinued in 2016, according to a study published in the Journal of Policy Modeling. If the Chinese government does nothing to reform its social security system, the accumulation of related debt will be explosive, according to the study. As public finances around the world are impacted by population ageing and fiscal crises, it raises questions about how public systems will be able to continue providing protections for large numbers of people. Governments everywhere are faced with difficult decisions. Social protection systems were designed around the idea of a single, full-time employment relationship; according to a report published in 2018 by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, it is unclear how growing numbers of those who are self-employed or change jobs regularly fit into standard frameworks. According to the OECD report, one interesting approach to this is the so-called artists’ insurance scheme in Germany, which covers artists and writers for health and pensions - but not for unemployment. More broadly, untying social protection from employment (by granting entitlements based on residency) could close future coverage gaps, according to the report. Countries receiving significant numbers of migrants must also determine how best to offer protections to these people; more than one in five labour migrants is not covered by a social protection scheme, according to a briefing published by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation in 2017, while more than half of migrants cannot take social protection benefits back to their home country.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.111"
"4.680","Sustainable Communications Infrastructure","","The amount of electricity consumed by information and communications technology networks rose 31% between 2010 and 2015, while related operational carbon emissions rose 17%, according to a study published in 2018 by the Centre for Sustainable Communications at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology. That trend is expected to continue unabated, as internet users, devices, and data rates increase, and networks expand. More energy-efficient infrastructure can directly result in a reduction in carbon emissions; this is a particularly pressing need as the world braces for the fourth industrial revolution, which is a result of a combination of emerging technologies related to digital communications, including cloud computing, data analytics, artificial intelligence, and drones. This mix of technologies may also lead to a related mix of standards - and to a resulting fragmentation of valuable resources and capacity. Greater adaptability of infrastructure, in a world of diverse wireless standards, is essential; however, current, state-of-the-art communications networks, including emerging Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks, are based on rigid, centralized architecture. Blockchain-style distributed networking, where users are able to communicate through direct, peer-to-peer links, could improve service quality by reducing latency, and cut energy costs. Software-defined networking, which enables a network administrator to quickly manipulate traffic and services independent of hardware, and network functions virtualization, where things like intrusion detection can be done through software rather than having to rely on hardware, are being touted as the future of networks. According to a white paper published by the World Economic Forum in 2017, these technologies are being used to replace traditional, hardware-based platforms, and increase efficiency while reducing both operating costs and energy consumption. Another way to cut energy consumption, and to increase environmental sustainability, is to replace telecom networks powered by the electricity grid and batteries. Renewable energy can be problematic due to the intermittent nature of the related energy supply. However, due to the evolution of advanced power storage technologies, sustainable power generation is expected to emerge as a reliable alternative to fossil-fuel-based power in the near future. When it comes to Internet of Things networks, for example, energy harvesting sensors can provide a sustainable alternative to battery-powered sensors. The digital communications industry should make efforts to optimize accordingly.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.39"
"4.681","Sustainable Community Design","","Designing for a climate-challenged environment necessitates a systemic shift; an ability to absorb and recover from disaster is now paramount. In Los Angeles, a dry city where water must be transported over long distances to reach the population, an initiative called Divining LA engages city planners and low-income residents in identifying stormwater capture opportunities. Meanwhile in the Philippines, the “Design Against the Elements” competition was launched in 2010 to solicit designs for multi-use structures that can withstand increasingly-prevalent extreme weather events. Destructive storms, heatwaves, polluted air and drought caused by global warming exacerbate environmental injustices that have often located highways, power plants, hazardous waste landfills, and polluting industries in poor neighbourhoods. Yet, design can also act as a catalyst for positive change; Detroit Future City, for example, is a non-profit group stewarding a 50-year plan to use blue infrastructure (landscapes that capture and clean stormwater) and green infrastructure that harnesses nature to transform neglected parts of this shrinking, post-industrial city. In addition, in Detroit and other cities the Farm Hack online platform supports a more resilient food system by sharing best practices and designs for open-source, affordable farming tools. By addressing pollution, designers can also generate economic activity. The political and architectural practice Estudio Teddy Cruz + Fonna Forman, for example, working in partnership with local residents, has proposed functional public spaces for under-used areas along the Tijuana-San Diego border that can clean and protect the river and estuary in the area. In Kibera, a large informal settlement in Kenya, the Kibera Public Space Project was formed in 2006 to design and develop micro-enterprises, a community pavilion, a playground, and composting gardens on once-polluted areas. Innovative related forms of ownership are also sprouting up; inspired by the Mondragon Cooperatives in Spain, which prioritize people over profits, Cleveland, Ohio-based institutions including universities and hospitals are engaged in a bold experiment to create returns from the green economy for low-income residents by opening employee-owned Evergreen Cooperatives that offer these residents living-wage jobs. Meanwhile in the western US the Oglala Lakota Nation has designed a more regenerative community to counteract decades of poverty, diminishing life expectancy, and inadequate housing. Based on self-sufficiency, economic self-determination, and environmental resilience, this community is a living laboratory for developing ways to overcome systemic poverty. This key issue was curated in partnership with Cynthia E. Smith, Curator of Socially Responsible Design at Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.76"
"4.682","Sustainable Consumption","","There were about 3.2 billion people in the middle class as of 2016, already spending a total of roughly $35 trillion annually - and roughly 140 million people are now joining the middle class every year, according to a 2017 report published by the Brookings Institution. Nearly 90% of these new entrants are in Asia, according to the report. Consumers in emerging economies in Asia and elsewhere aspire to high-consumption, western lifestyles. Efforts to encourage sustainability therefore need to expand beyond a focus on production, and pay greater attention to this growing consumer group. Only about 13% of consumers are willing to pay more for green products, according to the results of a study published in 2017 by the Network for Business Sustainability. Meanwhile about one third of the food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted globally (or about 1.3 billion tons per year), according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Companies must try to shift consumer behaviour towards greater sustainability. The World Economic Forum’s Engaging Tomorrow’s Consumer project spawned the “Collectively” digital platform, which featured founding companies including Coca-Cola and Unilever and was designed to inspire young people with stories about a more sustainable future. According to data published in the Forum’s Engaging Tomorrow’s Consumer Project Report 2015, 93% of millennials say they would buy a product because it is associated with a cause. The Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is being fuelled by converging strains of rampant technology innovation, is enabling business models that can better drive sustainability - such as the so-called sharing economy model exemplified by Uber’s ride-hailing service, or Airbnb’s rental service. The sharing economy is expected to grow in value from $14 billion as of 2014 to $335 billion by 2025, according to the Brookings Institution.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.9"
"4.683","Sustainable Development and Universal Coverage","","The World Health Organization has estimated that about 1.2 billion people around the world are living in extreme poverty - a significant cause of poor health outcomes, as people with limited resources face greater exposure to risks and disability due to inadequate sanitation, food, shelter, and medical care. The cost of health care is also a major contributing factor to poverty; according to a 2016 WHO fact sheet, 100 million people were being stricken with poverty due to health care costs every year, and 150 million people were suffering financial catastrophe every year because of out-of-pocket expenditures on health services. In addition, a 2017 report published by the World Bank estimated that roughly 800 million people are spending more than 10% of their household budget on health care, while nearly 200 million people must spend one quarter of their household budget on health care. The cyclical nature of poverty and sub-optimal health outcomes is evident in both high- and low-income countries. A major contributing factor is the rise of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as cancer or diabetes, and related risk factors that can burden individuals, their families, and entire communities; these include impoverishment from long-term treatment and care costs, and a loss of income due to reduced productivity. In 2015, the United Nations adopted Sustainable Development Goals in order to help the global community address complex, interconnected issues related to poverty, global health, human rights, economic growth, environmental sustainability, and equality. The third development goal features targets including the reduction of the burden of NCDs, and achieving universal health coverage by 2030 - including access to quality health services, effective and affordable essential medicines and vaccines, and protection from related financial risk. In a progress report on the Sustainable Development Goals published by the UN in 2017, it noted that it will be necessary to avert an anticipated shortfall of about 18 million health workers by 2030, if it is to remain possible to achieve and sustain universal health coverage by that point; major shortages of such workers are a serious concern in nearly all of the countries in sub-Saharan Africa, according to the report.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.69"
"4.684","Sustainable Digital Transformation","","In every industry, digital transformation is pushing companies to re-evaluate their business models, and new, technology innovation-driven market entrants are transforming the strategic landscape. Dramatic levels of disruption in media, entertainment, communications, and retail in recent years highlight the susceptibility of other sectors including healthcare, insurance, banking, energy, and automotive. How they will respond to digital disruption is an existential question for organizations around the world; successful transformations are rare. In 2018, more than $1.2 trillion will be spent by companies on digital transformation efforts, according to Our Shared Digital Future, a report published by the World Economic Forum in 2018, and only 1% of these efforts will actually achieve their goals. In addition, as much as 70% of new value created over a ten-year period is likely to be based on data-driven, digitally-enabled networks and platforms. With most digital assets in the hands of the private sector, it is the behaviour of the global business community that will shape the new digital social contract that is poised to emerge. According to the 2018 Edelman Trust Barometer, a survey conducted in 28 countries, public trust in the technology sector declined slightly compared with the prior year. In a supplementary report published by Edelman, the public relations firm noted that trust in technology among the “informed public” actually fell sharply in regions including the US, Hong Kong, and France; according to the supplementary report, a fear of fake news being used as a weapon was on the minds of seven in 10 respondents, and trust in newer, emerging technologies such as blockchain and self-driving cars commanded less public confidence than more established technologies. In addition to privacy and security concerns, there are broader ethical questions about the ways that organizations have used digital technology in a way that threatens to erode trust in institutions. There are also concerns about the effects of new digital technologies on the environment, related to power-hungry data centres, electronic waste, and the significant amounts of energy needed to power blockchain. Establishing new norms of ethical behaviour regarding digital technology, and attaining higher levels of customer trust, will be critical for a successful digital transformation.

"4.685","Sustainable Energy in the US","","As the US approaches energy independence, thanks to record levels of domestic production, a key issue will be how, and how much, to incorporate renewables into the overall mix. Renewable energy has long been poised to impact the way Americans work, drive and play. The International Renewable Energy Agency reported in 2015 that the US was the second largest energy consumer in the world, and according to US government data, the country’s production and use of biofuels and non-hydroelectric renewable energy sources doubled between 2000 and 2014; about 10% of the energy consumed by Americans in 2014 was derived from renewable sources. However, there are concerns about the future of sustainable energy policies in the US. The Donald Trump presidency will have a decisive impact on how - and even whether - the US energy system will continue to evolve in the coming years. In 2017, Trump announced the US would withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, an international accord that aims to combat climate change. (In addition, in 2018, the US Environmental Protection Agency disclosed plans to ease vehicle emissions standards so that new cars sold would have to average about 36 miles per gallon by 2025, rather than the previously-mandated 50 miles per gallon). The renewable energy industry has proven its ability to create new jobs, and the general rise of renewables has created an economic ripple effect across US industries. The Union of Concerned Scientists 2009 report Clean Energy, Green Jobs noted that by 2025, national renewable electricity standards could generate $263.4 billion in new capital for renewable technologies, $13.5 billion in new biomass production revenue and wind land lease payments, and $11.5 billion in additional property tax revenue at the local level. A switch to renewables could also stabilize electricity prices, and lower prices (and demand) for natural gas and coal by increasing competition. Another critically important implication of this potential change to renewable energy: the US would rely less on foreign sources for its energy needs.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.130"
"4.686","Sustainable Growth in Bangladesh","","Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to the impacts of climate change. In the southern region of the country, 40% of productive land is projected to be lost if sea levels rise 65 centimetres by the 2080s, according to a World Bank study. A government study noted that changes in crop production due to the impact of climate change will increase the number of people living in poverty, and about 20 million people in coastal areas are already affected by salinity levels in drinking water. Rising contamination of both groundwater and surface water are causing widespread diarrhoea outbreaks in some regions and the country, where only about 11% of the land was covered by forests as of 2015, is losing precious forest land. In order to achieve United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (established by agreement in 2015, to guide responsible global development until 2030) in Bangladesh, the country has implemented a number of new initiatives; the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan was formulated by concerned stakeholders, and the National Sustainable Development Strategy was prepared with support from the United Nations Environment Programme. The government’s Seventh Five Year Plan, an economic growth program, emphasizes the sustainable use of resources - for example, by promoting the use of surface water instead of ground water for agriculture, and by supporting investment in agricultural research on crop varieties resistant to salinity, flooding, and cold. While measures have also been put in place to incentivize the import and use of environmentally-friendly technologies, Bangladesh must further strengthen its climate change adaptation and mitigation. Some positive signs include the establishment of the Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund, to address food security, social protection, health, disaster management, infrastructure, mitigation, and institutional strengthening. Steps have also been taken to promote so-called social forestry, and to establish new forests. Still, environmental groups have questioned land-use policies in the country, in addition to its energy strategy (which still relies heavily on fossil fuels), its lack of measures to protect water bodies, insufficient regulation of industrial waste management, and lack of protection for forests including the Sundarbans - the world’s largest mangrove forest. Bangladesh needs to better avail itself of assistance from the Green Climate Fund (a UN mechanism), and must boost its institutional capacity for implementing and enforcing government plans.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.17"
"4.687","Sustainable Land Use","","About one quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions result from agricultural activity on the nearly 50 million square kilometres of land now under cultivation - an area roughly the size of Asia. Growing and increasingly wealthy populations in developing countries will require even more agricultural acreage, often obtained through the sort of deforestation that adds to greenhouse-gas emissions. Supply must be increased to meet these demands, while at the same time land degradation is curbed and forests are somehow preserved. A tally published in the journal Nature in 2015 counted 3 trillion trees on Earth, which were being cut down at a rate of about 15 billion trees per year (researchers have estimated that the global count has dropped by nearly half since the advent of agriculture). Tropical Forest Alliance 2020, a global partnership of governments, corporations, and civic organizations, promotes sustainable forestry by subtracting deforestation from the process of cultivating products like palm oil, pulp and paper. Innovation could further reduce the environmental impact of land use, while bolstering carbon storage, water flow regulation, and biodiversity. However, in developing countries where land and water resources are under the most stress, financing new innovation is constrained by limited public budgets, and private sector investment is needed. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has found that investment in land-use R&D can generate rates of return that are between 30% and 75%. Innovation that promotes sustainable land use is a key part of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, an era when technologies like satellites, drones, and autonomous vehicles with advanced sensors can monitor soil and water conditions and crop health, big data can be analysed by software capable of sending timely recommendations to a local farmer’s mobile phone, biotechnology can breed more resilient crops, renewable energy generation can be distributed, and financial technology (or “fintech”) can be delivered to communities. The World Economic Forum’s New Vision for Agriculture, in partnership with the G7, has engaged roughly 600 organizations to work towards the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Effective innovation and collaboration, promoted through the Forum’s Innovation with a Purpose initiative, are essential for creating sustainable land use that helps mitigate climate change while feeding the world’s growing population.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.34"
"4.688","Sustainable Production and Operation","","The aerospace industry consumes a significant amount of fuel and materials, and the rate of production of aircraft only continues to increase. This growth should be sustainably managed for the long term; the increased use of biofuels, lightweight materials, and electrical propulsion to reduce emissions could help make this a reality. One example of lightweight material is the latest iteration of aerogel, which is able to withstand high temperatures and offers superior sound-proofing. A significant reason for the growing interest in biofuels is aviation’s substantial carbon footprint. Supplementing aviation fuel with greater amounts of biofuels could help cut down significantly on air pollution, and achieve a more sustainable mode of transport. Hybrid electrical propulsion is also being invested in by industry players, both big and small. Equipping short- to medium-range commercial passenger jets with hybrid technology could provide numerous benefits, including increased fuel efficiency (though on-board generators will likely still exist, in order to top-up batteries for electric engines), noise reduction, and simplified maintenance.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.5"
"4.689","Sustainable Society","","Demographic trends are on course to pose serious challenges to Korean society. In 2015, the Republic of Korea (or South Korea) had the lowest fertility rate in the world, according to World Bank data: 1.2 births per woman, down from 6.1 in 1960. The country also has an ageing population, according to the data, with 13.1% over 65 years of age as of 2015, compared with the global average of 8.27%. Women are poorly integrated into the labour force, per the data: 50% of women over the age of 15 are in the workforce, compared with 72% of men. These trends paint a picture of a country likely to struggle to sustain its economic growth. Greater immigration could provide a solution. Integrating foreigners into a highly homogenous, relatively closed society would likely be a challenge. Still, the country’s desire to continue on a positive trajectory makes more inclusive growth imperative.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.113"
"4.690","Swiss Education and Talent","","Switzerland features four languages (German, French, Italian, and Romansh) and distinct cultures, and connects surrounding European countries via its historic traffic routes through the Alps. It has developed a strong education system that combines world-leading post-secondary institutions with a unique vocational training (apprenticeship) system. The Swiss education system represents a healthy balance between bottom-up (market-driven) and top-down (federal) initiatives. While the vocational system is predominantly driven by professional organizations, the post-secondary system is driven by cantons (the state jurisdictions within Switzerland) and by the federal government (when it comes to the federal institutes of technology). The education system is funded by a mix of federal and cantonal subsidies, industry financing, and student contributions. According to the World Economic Forum’s Global Human Capital Report 2017, Switzerland benefits from the high quality of its education system, strong vocational training and a high level of skills diversity. The country ranked 3rd in the overall Human Capital Index (behind Norway and Finland), and was rated best in terms of know-how, and second-best in terms of development. The strength of the Swiss education and training system was demonstrated during the financial crisis, when youth unemployment rates soared in many European countries but remained relatively stable in Switzerland, Germany, and Austria. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Switzerland’s market-driven, vocational and professional education and training system benefits from the strong influence of employers. However, vocational and on-the-job training is becoming less attractive for young people. As a result, various initiatives have been launched to promote dual-education and fight youth unemployment. According to the 2016-2017 Times Higher Education’s World University Rankings and ShanghaiRanking’s Academic Ranking, Swiss institutions such as the two Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology (ETH Zurich and EPF Lausanne) are among the best worldwide. This has contributed to a relatively high proportion of international faculty members and students, which further strengthens the system. However, it has been projected that Switzerland will suffer from a significant lack of skilled employees in the near future. Changes in the job market and dramatic shifts in skills requirements have played a role. The skills mismatch is not unique to Switzerland; the World Economic Forum’s 2017 white paper Realizing Human Potential in the Fourth Industrial Revolution recommends addressing the situation by ensuring there is a sufficient science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education to deliver strong digital skills.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.125"
"4.691","Swiss Trade Trends","","In 2016, Switzerland’s trade openness, measured as the sum of imports and exports of both goods and services, amounted to 120% of the country’s GDP, or six percentage points higher than it had been the previous year. Switzerland’s economy is among the most highly developed in Europe, with a trade openness that ranks behind only Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands. Switzerland’s trade surplus shrunk from 12% of GDP in 2013 to 8% of GDP by 2016, as a result of the growth of imports relative to exports. The country, which is home to pharmaceutical giants such as Roche and Novartis, engineering giant ABB, several watchmakers, and other large manufacturers, had exports as of 2016 that were concentrated in chemical and pharmaceutical products (44.8% of the total), machines and electronics (14.7%), and watches (9.2%). In real terms, exports declined by 0.8% between 2015 and 2016, with the decline most pronounced for the struggling watch industry (watch exports fell 15.3% in real terms). The destinations of Swiss exports changed substantially between 2005 and 2016; the share headed to the European Union fell from 63% of the total to 48% during the period. Within the EU, Switzerland`s key export destinations in 2016 were Germany (14.3%), the United Kingdom (10.7%), and France (6.1%). Outside the EU, Swiss exports mainly went to the US (12.1%) and mainland China (9%). The origin points of Switzerland’s imports have changed dramatically since 2005, when 80% came from the EU; by 2016, that figure fell to 56%. Meanwhile Switzerland has increased imports from the United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong, and the US. Data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development show considerable production sharing between Switzerland and Germany as of 2011 (the most recent available). This reflects a significant amount of intermediates being traded between Germany and Switzerland for further processing, and highlights the intricate supply chain network binding the two countries. Production sharing also takes place between Switzerland and Italy, though to a much less significant degree.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.125"
"4.692","Synergies and Collaboration","","The inflow of talent to many industries has been threatened by a decline of interest in careers related to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), particularly in countries that have well-established legacies and capabilities in the materials field. This trend may only become more prominent, if universities and other places where our work forces are developed fail to recognize that increasingly interconnected professional fields require a new type of professional who is capable of thinking, creating, and operating in a collaborative fashion, devoid of the boundaries that may have traditionally protected an industry like materials. This in-demand ability to work as part of a dynamic ecosystem poses challenges to the supply of talent not only in technical disciplines; it is particularly important when working to develop smarter regulation, more effective risk management, and more productive stakeholder relations. Only a truly dynamic and nimble regulatory system can provide the support and oversight necessary for the fast past-paced technical progress anticipated in the materials field. This is especially true in the case of biological materials, where extended approval processes may have not only a detrimental effect on the time to commercialization for innovations, but more importantly, may dis-incentivize truly disruptive innovation to begin with, by discouraging risk-taking. It may also result in developers cutting corners and compromising on the quality of the discovery process. In parallel, schemes that can facilitate the more effective deployment of capital at all stages, whether it is for funding basic research, or for scaling up entrepreneurial, emerging businesses that fuel disruption in the form of venture capital or other private equity financing, should also better adapt to the growing complexity of risk presented by the blurring boundaries that once safely separated disciplines. These challenges call for the establishment of more collaborative platforms, where the protection of investors, consumers, and others all along the value chain receives a greater amount of resources (financial and otherwise), and the attention of a broader range of actors. Ultimately, risk must be more carefully distributed according to each actor’s ability and role, and must not be allowed to blunt the tireless search for new business models.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.4"
"4.693","Synthetic Biology","","Civilization has largely set course for a more resource-efficient and sustainable global economy. One of the ultimate goals is to reconcile demand for chemical materials needed to treat human disease, develop sustainable agriculture and fisheries, bolster food security, and power industrial applications with the need to ensure biodiversity and environmental protection. In order to help achieve this, many countries have leveraged advances in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering by using natural biological processes to produce important chemicals - and making use of standardized, intelligent “cell factories” (collections of microbial cells, often built from bacteria or yeast, that can function like a chemical production facility). The consequences of this could be as significant as the impact of alchemy on chemistry millennia ago, with enormous and as perhaps unimaginable implications for medicine and materials science. The range of potential applications is vast, encompassing, and not limited to: diagnostics, therapeutics, sensors, environmental remediation, energy production, and biomolecular and chemical manufacturing. Studies have shown, for example, the potential to deploy bacteria-based cell factories to sustainably produce ethanol and butanol - which could in turn be used to de-carbonize transportation. Following the emergence of recombinant DNA technology, which mashes up DNA from different species to produce combinations that have value for medicine or industry, biological systems have become widely used in industries such as chemicals and pharmaceuticals. However, the cell factories underpinning these processes often encounter systemic failure and suffer from instability. Synthetic biology and metabolic engineering can be applied to these problems by developing cells specifically designed for predictable, efficient, and streamlined production. Synthetic biology and metabolic engineering also enable the development of new biological systems capable of efficiently producing industrial chemicals and materials while consuming relatively less time, labour, and money. Some examples of this trend include reported advances in the microbial production of gasoline, terephthalic acid (an organic compound used to make clothing and plastic bottles), 1,4-butanediol (used to make fibres such as Spandex), and aromatic polyesters. In 2016, systems metabolic engineering was selected as one of the Top 10 emerging technologies by the World Economic Forum, for the ways that it can be used to more sustainably and affordably produce chemicals by using plants instead of fossil fuels.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.22"
"4.694","Systemic Risk and Resilience","","Just as a country with extensive borders must fortify a relatively greater number of potential points of entry, the growing expanse of digital networks has multiplied the amount of digital ground that must be placed under surveillance. It is now easy to become overwhelmed by the amount of security data being received, and by the frequency of false alarms produced by computer sensory systems. So-called data fusion, or methods by which organizations can collect, filter, and identify disparate intrusion information, must be constructed in such a way that they maximize cyber-situational awareness. Governments and businesses can use data fusion to test defense systems and more accurately identify cyberattacks, in order to rapidly respond. Meanwhile the people analysing raw cyber security data can benefit from greater automation - which can highlight data patterns that indicate a potential intrusion. However, this presents new challenges, as cyber security professionals now have to determine just how precise their warning systems are; automation that produces false alarms, and fails to detect actual threats, jeopardizes cyber security. In order to properly mitigate security risks and maximize resilience, information must be efficiently and accurately processed. Computer scientist George Tadda has outlined specific metrics that can be used to continually examine automation procedures and calculate a system’s purity, cost utility, and timeliness - such as recall, precision, and fragmentation. By making incremental changes to pattern recognition and human assessment, organizations can optimize their system resilience. A report published by the World Economic Forum in 2017, Advancing Cyber Resilience; Principles and Tools for Boards, outlined a cyber-attack in 2016 that blocked access to services including Twitter and the New York Times’ website; the attack took advantage of specific strategic choices that had been made by the companies involved, including a “speed-to-market” strategy for hardware that made a significant number of devices vulnerable to hackers, and a decision to concentrate resources on one or a few servers rather than spreading the load across several. The report laid out a series of principles for bolstering resilience, including having corporate boards accurately gauge risk appetite, and ensuring that one, fully-authorized corporate officer is accountable for reporting on the organization’s capability to manage the implementation of cyber resilience.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.38"
"4.695","Systems Change","","Social entrepreneurs have posted a string of successes, whether it has been through VisionSpring’s provision of eyeglasses to millions of poor people in developing countries, or the more than 160 million books and other essentials provided to educators of children in need by First Book. Yet, the social innovation sector is coming to terms with the limits of incremental growth, according to Beyond Organizational Scale: How Social Entrepreneurs Create Systems Change, a report published by the World Economic Forum in 2017. Society’s needs are significant, and models for scaling up in size to meet them are still too narrow, or take too long to implement. While simply replicating private sector service delivery models is often ineffective, some forward-thinking social innovators are moving towards a model of systems change - meaning, transformation on a broad scale that even small organizations can help facilitate. True systems change requires an inclusive approach that focuses on the connections that link an ecosystem together, rather than focusing on delivering a predefined solution to intended beneficiaries. Social innovation has helped transform beneficiaries into actors who can help expand a business, as clients or employees. Social innovators need to adapt to the local environment. A continuous flow of data and evidence is necessary in order to create feedback mechanisms in systems, according to the Forum’s report; the monitoring and evaluation enabled by this flow can serve as tools for continuous improvement and reassessment, potentially enabling social entrepreneurs to alter course as needed. Systems change also requires developing a shared understanding of problems facing a multitude of different stakeholders, with differing motivations. For systems change to occur, social innovators must convene these disparate players, who are often from sectors that may not have worked together previously. Governments, in particular, can be a crucial partner for achieving large-scale, systemic change. Social innovators therefore need to develop skills such as coalition building, and negotiating legislative reform - and organizations need to either create new roles for people who have these skill sets, or invest in educating existing employees.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.118"
"4.696","Systems Leadership","","“Systems leadership” is about leading in a situation where power is diffused, and where the consequences of decisions are magnified and less predictable as their impact progressively ripples across domains. It requires cultivating a shared vision for change, and empowering innovation and collaborative action. According to a report published by Harvard Kennedy School’s Corporate Social Responsibility Initiative in 2016, systems leadership is needed to address complex problems related to food security, climate change, and gender equality - which cannot be solved with a top-down, pre-planned approach that focuses on one area to the exclusion of others. Instead, these problems call for the engagement of diverse stakeholders from multiple sectors. Systems leadership done right also means balancing short- and long-term goals in order to optimize value for everyone, not only for the loudest, wealthiest, or most influential. By cultivating a shared vision, according to the Harvard Kennedy School report, nimble systems leadership can galvanize a diverse array of interested parties and help ensure that their efforts align, potentially producing better results in faster way than would otherwise be possible. The attributes of an individual “systems leader” include humility, integrity, an interest in the system over one’s self, and an ability to facilitate constructive dialogue. The Harvard Kennedy School report cited as an example the World Economic Forum’s New Vision for Agriculture initiative. Following the food crisis of 2007 and 2008, which saw the price of food staples like rice, corn, and wheat rise dramatically to the detriment of many people in the developing world, the Forum’s initiative brought together stakeholders from business, government, and civil society to build greater resilience into the food supply chain - a highly complex, fragile system vulnerable to external shocks, over which no single actor can exercise meaningful control. As part of the initiative, 17 companies, including food manufacturers, commodity traders, and beverage producers, came together with key government representatives and civil society members in a neutral space to map out issues, system linkages, and opportunities for action. More than 500 different organizations are now participating in related efforts, according to the report; these include working with farmers’ groups to build more sustainable value chains for specific commodities, and sharing farmers’ needs with financial institutions so appropriate credit and insurance products can be developed.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.93"
"4.697","Talent Patterns","","The global competition for workers with desirable skills is intense. China’s strategic focus on developing a highly-skilled, science- and innovation-focused workforce will place increasing pressure on the ability of other countries to tap related talent, for example. Meanwhile Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member states, including Qatar and Saudi Arabia, are seeking to fill entire market sectors with migrant workers, both unskilled and skilled. As governments re-think their migration and labour policies, it can have far-reaching effects. The GCC’s Council of Labour and Social Development Ministers, for example, has announced plans to unify the bloc’s labour market, and to provide avenues for the naturalization of migrant workers. And in Bahrain, which has seen irregular flows of migrant workers mostly from South Asia since the 1970s, and where an estimated more than 60% of the country’s workforce is made up of overseas workers, the government opted in 2016 to implement a regularization program intended to curb the abuse of migrant workers and of the country’s work visa system, in part by providing tens of thousands of official work permits to foreign workers without sponsors. Another example is Malaysia, which relies heavily on migrant workers from countries including Bangladesh, and has sought to bolster its regulations on foreign labour in order to conform with the standards of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement. In the US, there has been increased scrutiny of the use of so-called H-1B visas - which are issued to skilled workers from abroad (many in the technology sector), and have been criticized by President Donald Trump as a tool for American firms to use relatively cheap foreign labour. Proponents counter that the visas help companies tap the best possible talent. The percentage of H-1B visa petitions that are rejected rose to 41% in fiscal 2017 (ended in June 2017), from 13% in the prior year, according to US Citizenship and Immigration Services data. Most beneficiaries of H-1B petitions, or 247,927 out of a total of 336,107, were from India, according to the data, while the next-largest group of petitioners was from China. It remains to be seen whether multi-national corporations and governments will ever be able to fully exploit technology in order to realize decades-old conceptions of a virtual global workforce - which could enable people to reap the benefits of migration remotely, without being affected by political trends.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.98"
"4.698","Targeting the Poor","","In 2014, the World Bank reported that despite Bangladesh spending the equivalent of roughly 2% of its GDP on social safety net programs, about 70% of the country’s poor people were still not receiving any safety net support - largely due to shortcomings in identifying beneficiaries, and weak administration. In developing countries, the design of social insurance and poverty alleviation programs must enable the accurate targeting of the poor, and the adequate enforcement of related regulations. This is particularly true in regions where employment in the unofficial, grey economy is extensive, and where information for targeting purposes is therefore limited. In Iraq, for example, where development has been undercut by decades of conflict and economic decline, overall progress towards poverty reduction stalled after 2007, according to a report published by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development in 2016. The report noted that a targeting system in Iraq for providing cash transfers to nearly 1 million households resulted in only 11% of the poor receiving their benefits. In response to Iraq’s challenges, according to the report, the World Bank coordinated a knowledge exchange program with other countries including Turkey and Lebanon, which shared details about their respective cash transfer and targeting programs. Iraq has now developed a Social Protection Strategic Roadmap through 2019, according to the report. The need for better targeting is not confined to developing economies. According to an article published by Eurostat, the number of people in the European Union at risk of poverty or social exclusion in 2016 was higher than it had been in 2008 - despite a European target of reducing this population by 20 million, by the year 2020. Within individual EU member states, the effectiveness of social benefit programs for helping those at risk of poverty varied greatly, according to the article; while Finland was able to use such social transfers to decrease its poverty rate, in Romania transfers were far less successful, according to the report. Differences in the effectiveness of social protection spending can result from the underlying poverty levels before related programs begin, but they can also result from the design of that spending, according to the report.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.111"
"4.699","Taxation","","In its World Economic Outlook published in late 2018, the International Monetary Fund noted that a recent US tax overhaul was likely to widen the country’s fiscal deficit - which had already been under pressure due to spending on support for the country’s ageing population. While deficit expansion has provided a short-term boost to economic activity in the US, according to the IMF report, it has also piled onto already-unsustainable public debt, and created elevated risk not only for the US economy but for other global economies as well. In early 2018, the US Congressional Budget Office projected that the country’s deficit will surpass $1 trillion by 2020, two years sooner than had been previously estimated. The fiscal pressure comes as the US administration has signaled that it would like to move ahead with long-planned and significant spending on infrastructure. A country’s priorities, fiscal policies, and ways that its government collects taxes and spends public resources can all play major roles in boosting sustainable development, reducing poverty, and addressing inequality. However, priorities vary significantly from country to country. While France spent the equivalent of 31.5% of its GDP on social spending (defined as resources redistributed to low-income households, the elderly, the young, the unemployed, the disabled, or the sick) in 2016, South Korea spent the equivalent of 10.4%, according to data published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; the OECD spending average for 2016 was 21% of GDP, while the figure for the US was the equivalent of 19.3% of GDP. Taxation can provide a means of directly addressing market inequalities, as long as it is designed to minimize loopholes, ensures a progressive system where high earners pay a larger share, and provides for funding to reach those most in need without dampening their incentive to work. Meanwhile government-funded social safety nets can mitigate the effects of external economic shocks, and help the chronically poor benefit from growth. For the most vulnerable groups of people with no other means of adequate support, such as single-parent households and the disabled, cash transfers can be a viable option. One example of a cash transfer program, in Zambia, was cited by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations for reducing extreme poverty by reaching about 150,000 households between 2003 and 2014.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.58"
"4.700","Tech and Connectivity in Latin America","","Advancements in terms of information and communications technology vary across different parts of Latin America; infrastructure development and penetration rates differ greatly between countries, between urban and rural areas, and between multiple urban areas within the same country. According to the World Bank, as of 2017 there were 107.4 mobile cellular subscriptions per 100 people in Latin America and the Caribbean, compared with the global average of 104.5. Digital literacy among the region’s population remains low, however, and most of the technology being used is imported. According to a report published by the GSMA in 2018, 57% of people in Latin America are covered by a mobile broadband network but do not subscribe, while one in 10 people live outside of mobile broadband coverage. In addition, mobile internet service in Latin America often lags in terms of quality. According to a report published by the Inter-American Development Bank in 2018, only an average of 17% of the populations in Latin American countries has adopted 4G technology - which is at least 10 times faster than previous mobile technologies and is essential for accessing most applications and services, including secure online payments. Low broadband quality also limits access to cloud-computing services, which could enable companies in the region to access higher computing capacity at lower costs. Young people in Latin America who are online are relatively active, and hungry for both new information and outlets for expression; yet, their digital economy skills are falling behind employer demands. Private initiatives with government support aimed at addressing this gap could help ensure that Latin America fully benefits from the digital economy.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.92"
"4.701","Technological Arms Race","","Major world powers are concerned about a new arms race. Chinese President Xi Jinping told China's second World Internet Conference in 2015 that ""each country should join hands and together … fight against a cyberspace arms race"". At the 2016 meeting of the G20 in Hangzhou, China, US President Barack Obama warned that while the US has significant offensive and defensive capacities for cyber warfare, the country’s intention is not to escalate into an arms race, as had happened in the past. The China-US agreement on cyber intrusions reached in 2015 has been hailed as a good first step, but progress on international accords in other fields, such as lethal autonomous weapons, is moving very slowly. The United Nations discussion on Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems held in 2016 resulted in a suggestion that states agree to establish a group of experts to make further recommendations. Meanwhile, even though killer robots may be some way off, a degree of autonomy (enabled by artificial intelligence – AI - software) is creeping into platforms that deliver lethal effects. The Anti-Submarine Warfare Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel, under development at the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), is a drone designed to track and ultimately destroy an enemy submarine. A new Long Range Anti-Ship Missile is being developed to semi-autonomously track and destroy enemy targets at long ranges. There is a growing awareness that technology can disrupt strategic stability when new types of weapons offer a way to level the playing field or tip the balance in another direction. For example, a swarm of autonomous drones might neutralize a super-power`s nuclear deterrence capabilities, and create conditions where a sudden conventional attack might succeed. Research on the military potential from bioengineering, gene therapy, nano-engineering and neuroscience may be less visible, but history suggests that it has not escaped attention. Ethical concerns that might otherwise be a restraining factor are often compromised when it comes to defence. When science fiction predicted the invention of the aircraft could lead to mass bombing, the notion was rejected on the basis that people would never be so immoral as to target civilians en masse. Even after the end of the Second World War human beings were used as guinea pigs for the development of chemical, nuclear and biological weapons.   It is important to note that competition to develop new technologies has benefits. Aerospace and defence industry investments in research into new forms of energy for their platforms have the potential to deliver advances in green energy. Much of the technology relevant for security is dual purpose, and this creates problems that can only be solved by effective public-private partnership. That requires a common understanding that just as technology has the potential to re-shape war, security policy will also be shaping the development and use of new technologies. Technology may offer ways to control and even tame conflict. Miscalculation is always a factor in war, and belligerents seldom start a fight knowing they will lose. But superior analytical accuracy from big data and machine learning could demonstrate – both to decision-makers and to those they represent - that the costs of war are likely to exceed the potential gain. For instance, Integral Mind Technologies, an AI company, recently introduced cogSolv, an AI system designed to understand how people from other groups view the world, simulate their reactions, and combine this with knowledge of the real world to avoid unintended offense, find persuasive negotiation win-wins and provide peacekeeping decision tools. The Fourth Industrial Revolution could deliver new forms of transparency to neutralize the advantage of surprise attacks, dispel unjustified fear and discourage aggression.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.83"
"4.702","Technological Barriers","","Virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR)  have been key technologies in niche markets such as flight simulation, automobile manufacturing and military training since the 1980s. While in the past science fiction novelists envisioned that we may one day access an alternate world based on a VR simulation, visors, and haptic devices (those that a user can virtually touch and feel), mass adoption was then unthinkable due to limited real-time graphics capabilities, computing power, and the high cost of hardware. With the democratization of high resolution displays, mobile processing, and the advancement of high-end gaming engines, VR and AR are poised to make a global impact beyond entertainment and gaming, with applications in education, health, business, retail, social media and communication in general. Facebook’s acquisition of Oculus in 2014 certainly played a significant role in accelerating the emergence of this technology. Other internet, software, and telecommunications companies such as Google, HTC, Sony, Microsoft, Huawei, Tencent, Apple and Snap are hoping for VR/AR to finally take off. In early 2016, Strategy Analytics estimated that early adoption of VR headsets would generate $895 million in revenue in the course of 2016, while cautioning that VR technology may not be ready yet. Not even a year later - in spring 2017 – Forbes reported that the interest and number of VR/AR sold units was substantially below expectation, especially when compared to predictions made for smartphones when they were first introduced. This slow growth is mainly caused by technological barriers and a lack of content and successful applications. While the price of technology will continue to drop, VR headsets are facing obvious hardware limitations such as their uncomfortable and bulky shapes and unnatural user interfaces. Insufficient display resolutions, frame rates and latency can cause cyber-sickness to the user and prevent extended usage. The development of this technology does not seem to be fast enough, and the creation of high quality virtual content is still difficult and expensive. While important progress in position tracking and optics is expected in coming years, studies reported in The Guardian and the Wall Street Journal have shown that current devices and VR experiences can cause physical side effects such as motion sickness, nausea, disorientation and headaches. Long-term effects such as seizures and poor hand-eye coordination have been documented, and researchers have raised concerns that there is still limited knowledge about how VR will affect children’s developing brains. The challenges and costs of producing and delivering enticing VR content is another critical reason for the slow adoption. Despite aggressive initiatives from operators such as Oculus, HTC and Google to engage the developer community to prioritize high-quality VR content, many producers and game publishers are not yet convinced that existing VR systems can provide a superior experience. Nevertheless, Silicon Valley and Chinese venture capitalists are not shying away from its potential, and are heavily betting on technology startups such as Jaunt VR, 8i, and Felix & Paul Studios for VR content creation. While specialized spherical 3D camera solutions and multi-view capture techniques are often involved for recording live action VR content, truly interactive and immersive experiences in VR still depend on conventional game development pipelines, which are expensive and slow. It will still take years until technologies for scalable content creation will become accessible for end consumers, but recent advances in computer graphics and machine learning are promising. In the meantime, film studios such as Disney and Fox and prominent Hollywood filmmakers such as Jon Favreau are exploring VR as a medium and tool for rapid virtual production and storytelling to increase the turn-around times in traditional film pipelines.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.133"
"4.703","Technological Competition","","In 2017, while talking to students about the “colossal” opportunities and threats presented by artificial intelligence, Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested that whoever, or whichever country, is able to become dominant in the field could rule the world. The rapid evolution of new technologies is already influencing the geopolitics of our multipolar, multi-conceptual world, where power has shifted and political ideas and values have fractured. This upheaval raises questions about how we should think about, and prepare for, war in the midst of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. In the same way that the first industrial revolution (the advent of manufacturing) created a decades-long progress gap between Britain and even its closest rivals, and the second (rapid industrialization) and third (digitalization) industrial revolutions helped spawn a period in which the US was globally pre-eminent, the Fourth Industrial Revolution and its convergence of digital technologies will have a marked influence on geopolitics. There are likely to be two primary channels for this. The first is through the economic gains that will flow to countries that emerge as technology leaders, particularly as a winner-takes-all dynamic characterizes many key technologies today. The second is through the application of new technologies to new types of weapons, and new types of conflict. For example, cyberattacks on critical infrastructure, drone swarms, or new methods of disrupting an adversary’s domestic political system could alter the global balance of power in unexpected ways. According to a McKinsey Global Institute paper published in 2018, the scramble to secure the high ground in terms of the technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution is unfolding at a frenetic pace and it has largely become a two-horse race; the 20 largest technology companies in the world are now either American or Chinese. In terms of artificial intelligence, for example, the rest of the world lags behind these two countries on key indicators such as patents, funding, and talent. And while a 2018 report written by researchers at Oxford’s Future of Humanity Institute found that China still trails the US in every AI driver except for data, this could change. The Chinese government issued a strategy document in 2017 resolving to position the country as the global leader in AI by 2030, by funnelling a large amount of public funding into the sector and by helping startups attract more venture capital.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.65"
"4.704","Technological Innovation","","Some innovation, like the development of new pharmaceuticals, has an obvious and direct link to novel scientific research; other types may result from using existing technology in a new way, or even from developments in unrelated fields. Many companies behind the sharing economy, for example, are essentially offshoots of existing internet and smartphone technologies. While emerging technologies like drones and 3D printing may create new markets and disrupt existing value networks, radical technical innovation in the form of so-called ""general purpose"" technologies has the potential to disrupt entire groups of industries; examples include the steam engine, the automobile, the computer, the internet and, potentially, artificial intelligence - all of which have had profound consequences for society. Technological innovation encompasses more than research and development. However, since research and development is key, many policy-makers have been keen to focus on ways in which it can be improved. Common areas of focus include national systems for research funding, systems for awarding and protecting patents (which are sometimes state-subsidized), the improvement of translating university research into value for the private sector; and tax incentives for innovative firms (such as R&D tax credits, or special tax regimes for revenue derived from intellectual property). R&D tends to be heavily concentrated. The Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development’s Science, Technology and Industry Scoreboard 2017 reported that the 50 largest R&D performers account for 40% of all business R&D efforts in Canada and the US, and for more than half of such efforts in Germany and Japan. In addition, according to the report, the headquarters of the top 2,000 R&D corporations worldwide are concentrated mostly in the US, China, and Japan; about 70% of these firms’ total R&D spending is concentrated within just 200 firms. Organizations undertaking technical research may not have the expertise or the desire to bring new products to market, so innovation often entails transferring knowledge and technology from universities and research groups to other entities - often in conjunction with the licensing of intellectual property. An alternative route to market, which may be preferable where no suitable organization already exists or where there is an opportunity to capture more value, is to form a startup or spinoff. In order to facilitate technological innovation in specific industries, some countries have established intermediary institutions, like Germany’s Fraunhofer Society institutes and the United Kingdom’s Catapult Centres.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.80"
"4.705","Technological Symbiosis","","Now, more than ever before, the interaction among advanced technologies plays a critical role in each of their respective development paths. For example, materials technologies and related issues are playing a defining role in the development of computing (via control of the laws of physics at the level of individual components, such as memory, circuits, or data storage devices), human enhancement (in terms of bio-compatible assemblies, optical devices, and skeletal components), and space technologies (from propulsion and communications systems to vehicle structures). Progress in advanced materials has in turn benefited greatly from rapid developments in computing, which offers powerful tools for modelling and visualization, data manipulation, and analysis, thereby enabling the bottom-up design of materials and optimization through feedback loops (where output from one effort is used as input for another). The next generation of materials development will likely incorporate emerging technologies such as robotics and artificial intelligence in integrated discovery processes - from experimental design, to rapid prototyping, to automated data acquisition and analysis, decision-making abilities, and self-optimizing pathways to solutions. Boundaries will continue to blur, and materials will evolve systemically. This is true not only of the application of, and inter-relations between technologies, but also of other important inputs to the development process. Data scientists, programmers, and algorithm designers will increasingly work hand-in-hand with material scientists and representatives of more traditional disciplines - spurring expertise deployment, and cross-nurturing. However, while a virtuous cycle may be formed among certain technologies and their paths to progress, deceleration or arrested development may compromise systemic evolution. For example, overly stringent regulations governing the use of materials may hinder other, adjacent sectors’ abilities to confront and conquer their most pressing challenges. These risks can be greatly minimized by working to increase the efficiency of collaboration, by broadening the education and interests of scientists and engineers, and by involving all stakeholders (public and private) in decision-making.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.4"
"4.706","Technology Access and Inclusion","","More than half of the global population is now using the internet. However, digital access and adoption have not been evenly distributed; according to the International Telecommunications Union, only 24.4% of Africa’s population was online as of 2018, even as Europe boasted a 79.6% internet penetration rate, while in the Americas penetration registered at 69.6% (more promising statistics show that growth during recent years in both mobile cellular subscriptions and mobile broadband subscriptions has been driven by countries in Asia and Africa). Creating more inclusive digital communities is essential for reducing this digital divide - by not only bolstering affordability and public access, but also by increasing digital skills and awareness. Greater digital inclusion can also improve public services and participation; for example, Maputo, Mozambique, which has a serious solid waste management problem and where a majority of residents live in informal settlements, has deployed a participatory monitoring platform (MOPA) and encouraged citizens to use it to report waste issues and to keep track of waste management services - in a bid to help improve service delivery. By gaining access to increasing amounts of digital content, people can become better able to understand and navigate the digital systems increasingly relied upon to deliver services related to health care, education, employment, and civic participation. Vulnerable communities like the exploding population of refugees and internally displaced people (as of June 2019, the UN Refugee Agency estimated there were nearly 26 million refugees worldwide, and more than 41 million internally displaced people) can particularly benefit from greater digital inclusion. Mobile phones are essential for refugees to coordinate travel and communicate with family; in 2016, Turkcell, a Turkish telecommunications company, launched its Hello Hope (“Merhaba Umut”) mobile app to help Syrian refugees in the country with basic language training and the provision of important basic information in Arabic and Turkish. Greater digital accessibility also presents an opportunity to better empower communities with more specific needs, like indigenous people, rural communities, people with disabilities (via assistive technologies like voice-recognition software), women and girls, and young people who have been historically disenfranchised.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.76"
"4.707","Technology Adoption","","Ethiopia’s performance in this area of the Index shows the greatest room for improvement in terms of fibre internet subscriptions, where it has a progress score (ranging from a poor mark of zero to a top mark of one hundred) of 0.70, resulting in a rank of 106th out of 114 countries; and in terms of fixed-broadband internet subscriptions where it has a progress score of 1.10 that results in a rank of 115th out of 140 countries. One indicator reflects a better performance: mobile-cellular telephone subscriptions, where it has a progress score of 49.70 that results in a rank of 130th out of 140 countries.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","['1.49', '1.53', '1.91', '1.126']"
"4.708","Technology Governance","","Powerful digital tools like artificial intelligence are swiftly disintermediating entire markets - which has taken influence away from traditional regulators and unskilled workers, and given it to corporations and skilled labour. Governments are being challenged to move beyond simply understanding major technological advances, to mitigating, shaping, and harnessing them in order to govern better, and to become more accessible, transparent, and trustworthy. Soon, governments will be forced to entirely change their approaches to creating and enforcing regulation, not least in order to better stimulate rather than stymie innovation. Potentially, governments will have to create brand-new instruments to cope with the spread of new technologies, either by nurturing internal expertise or working with the private sector. Governments that are agile will be able to find ways to reinvent themselves so they can better understand what they are regulating; close collaboration with businesses and civil society organizations will likely be necessary to make that happen. Faster, 5G networks are making digital communication more ubiquitous, while increasing processing power and storage capacity are boosting the scope of knowledge immediately available to any computer user. This, coupled with the increased availability and quality of data communicated through visualization and other analytic techniques, has the potential to fundamentally reshape public services so that they can respond more directly to citizen needs. But there is also a dark side to be managed. According to Cisco’s 2018 Annual Cybersecurity Report, cyber attackers targeting governments have developed increasingly sophisticated and threatening malware, and can cover their tracks with encryption while exploiting new vulnerabilities in cloud computing and the Internet of Things. Rules such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, which came into effect in 2018, are critical for managing the consequences of such threats - but will also introduce new complexity to governing.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.8"
"4.709","Technology Investment in Turkey","","Compared with other countries, Turkey has come up short when it comes to developing and integrating new technologies. According to World Bank data, despite steady improvement over the years, R&D spending as a percentage of GDP had only reached 0.88% by 2015 - far short of the 4.3% registered for Israel that year, and the 3.3% for Japan, and still well short of both the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average of 2.4% and the global average of 2.1% (though more recent data from the OECD show Turkish investment climbing to 0.96% of GDP by 2017). One bright spot might be procurement, an area where Turkish companies are close to the European average in terms of how many processes have been digitized, as the country has demonstrated significant “investment appetite” for related technologies like blockchain, according to a report published by the consultancy PwC in 2019. About 43% of service sector procurement in the country is digital at this point, compared with 63% in Belgium, 52% in Italy, and 45% in France, according to the report. Turkey is home to dozens of artificial intelligence-related startups, and the Turkey Artificial Intelligence Initiative was established in 2017 as a common platform for promoting AI applications and improving local awareness. Cybersecurity has also become a major focus; according to an International Telecommunication Union Global Cybersecurity Index report published in 2018, which measures the cybersecurity “commitment” of member states, Turkey ranked 20th - one slot ahead of Denmark, and one behind Finland. This level of commitment is merited; the number of cyberattacks in Turkey rose by 24.9% in the first half of 2018 compared with the same period a year earlier, which followed a 21.9% annual increase during 2017, according an executive from Kaspersky Lab cited in Turkish media. In 2017, the Turkish government established the Turkish Cyber Security Cluster project in order to foster cooperation and healthy competition in the cybersecurity market. The project has attracted hundreds of members, including electronics and appliance maker Vestel, KoçSistem (a digital division of the conglomerate Koç Holding), and military electronics maker Aselsan.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.127"
"4.710","Technology Leadership","","The Fourth Industrial Revolution, a new era characterized by emerging technologies fusing the physical and digital worlds at a potentially disconcerting pace, is opening up competitive gaps among economies and global businesses. Seven of the world’s 10 largest companies by market capitalization are now technology firms, most of which were founded less than a generation ago, and all of which are based in just two countries: the US and China. As they shred old assumptions about how businesses can create value, the ascendance of these market-dominating, often technology-driven firms appears inexorable, creating unforeseeable economic and political consequences. The uncertainties and opportunities that major technological advances generate will have a dramatic effect on the legitimacy (and effectiveness) of both private sector and political leaders. “Technology leadership” describes the way that these leaders can harness change, in order to meet strategic goals, generate value, and create an inclusive economy. Technology leadership is not only an ability to operate in the space between technology development, and traditional public and private structures; it is about being comfortable delving into both realms. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, for example, must not only understand the nuts and bolts of his product, but also grasp the impact that this platform has on free speech and news dissemination. The International Telecommunications Union estimates that less than half of the global population is now connected using some form of internet-enabled device. This reflects the stubborn digital divide separating those with internet access from those who remain without. Connectivity growth has been moving in the right direction in the world’s least developed countries, however, with internet user penetration in these areas projected to reach 17.5% by 2017, from 15.6% the prior year, according to an ITU report. The varying pace at which powerful tools like internet access and artificial intelligence are spreading sharpens existing divides and creates challenges for regulators - by removing parts of existing markets from under their purview, and creating new, unregulated sectors (traditional economic actors and workers are also affected). In addition, the blurring of traditional boundaries separating sectors imposes demands on leadership teams, which must go beyond simply understanding major technological advances to understanding how to mitigate their impact on traditional organizational structures.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.93"
"4.711","Technology and Digitalization","","Technology and digitalization have transformed our lives, and have often made them more efficient, comfortable and connected. Technology also continues to be an important force for enabling changes in behaviour, particularly in terms of boosting productivity and supporting active lifestyles. Fitness trackers can help motivate people to exercise, for example, especially when paired with social media platforms. Brightly-coloured graphics and tactile interfaces enable the gamification of challenges that otherwise might be more difficult to overcome. One example: the sudden and dramatic increase in the playing of “Pokémon go” several years ago, which managed to get millions of people off of the couch and outside, even if just for a little while. In order to reap the maximum benefit of these technologies, their design must encourage seamless interaction. The so-called “uncanny valley” effect of human representations that are less than 100% convincing, for example, can cause feelings of revulsion. Behavioural sciences can inform the design of technologies - mobile apps, avatars and robots, and driverless cars - based on knowledge about how users think and make decisions. Which designs appeal to humans? Which can be intuitively understood? By providing answers to these questions, the interplay of humans and machines can result in maximum benefit. In addition, behavioural scientists can help provide answers to pressing questions about the risks of increasing digitalization, such as what is the cost of monitoring and quantifying every aspect of our personal lives, how will this affect our well-being, and will we feel like autonomous beings any more if technology takes over so many of our daily tasks. And, of course, will we feel more disconnected as human interaction increasingly moves from physical to virtual, and what are the consequences of the digital footprints we leave behind. According to a 2013 academic paper, Private Traits and Attributes are Predictable From Digital Records of Human Behavior, artificial intelligence can predict, with a high degree of accuracy, private traits like sexual orientation or political and religious views, from just a few Facebook likes. This is potentially alarming, given that in some parts of the world people can be legally prosecuted for their homosexuality or political views. A 2017 paper by faculty at the University of Nottingham suggested that artificial intelligence could do a better job than established algorithms in predicting, based on medical records, the likelihood that a patient will suffer a heart attack - potentially making it easier to educate at-risk populations about precautionary measures. Artificial intelligence’s potential to be a curse or a cure depends in large part on whether policy makers manage to adequately define the boundaries of its use.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.20"
"4.712","Technology and Innovation for Production","","The development of a web of interconnected technologies is swiftly transforming production systems. Connectivity technologies like Wi-Fi and ZigBee, artificial intelligence technologies like speech recognition and biometrics, and flexible automation (equipment that can be refigured according to what it is being used to make) allow for radical innovation when it comes to production and related business models. Meanwhile concepts including the Internet of Things and mobile computing, and developments in data storage and processing, are enabling companies to access and analyse data from across their supply chains nearly in real-time. Managing this tsunami of accessible data will be a key challenge for the advanced manufacturing sector going forward; according to current estimates, only between 1% and 5% of all data collected is currently being utilized, which is an amount poised to increase drastically in the near future. This need to make better use of data creates a corresponding need for effective governance of key enabler technologies, such as 5G networks. Over the course of the past decade, the cost of sensors has been cut in half, bandwidth costs have become 40 times cheaper, and processing costs have become 60 times cheaper. Now, by integrating “big” data (the fast, efficient analysis of massive sets of data in order to generate insights) into their operations, manufacturers should be able to cut their product development and production costs in half, according to a McKinsey Global Institute projection. Meanwhile developments in flexible automation have spawned entire networks of multi-purpose machines, capable of outperforming single-purpose machines in terms of quality, speed and agility. In addition, additive manufacturing (commonly known as 3D printing) is reinventing production processes. According to a report published in 2016 by the consultancy EY, about a third of plastics, automotive, aerospace, pharmaceutical and medical companies were already using 3D printing to make actual components or products, as opposed to limiting their use to rapid prototyping. In order to take advantage of related opportunities, governments and manufacturers need to swiftly identify how to best leverage such new technologies.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.3"
"4.713","Technology and the Law","","As cyber threats evolve, public officials must stay up-to-date. Lawmakers are struggling to keep up with the realities of 3D-printed weapons, for example, and drone interference with aircraft, not to mention the staggering rate of change in terms of increased global internet use. An inability to stay ahead of the curve creates the risk of abuses (through ignorance or malice) with no legal recourse - and may leave entire nations without the ability to make an informed response to cyberattacks. Unlike many other areas, such as traditional security, government officials are often not well-versed in the nuances of cybercrime and cyberwarfare. This lack of understanding is exacerbated by the already challenging task of identifying a suspected party and their intent. The process of identifying the cause, scope and perpetrator of an attack falls under the category of cyber forensics, which involves numerous legal hurdles. For example, cloud computing, or using remote servers to host data online, has become a major obstacle to prosecuting cybercrime, as it creates a jurisdictional nightmare. As a team from the University of Glasgow noted in a 2014 article in the International Journal of Digital Crime and Forensics, it is now incredibly easy for malicious agents to store incriminating digital evidence on servers that physically exist outside of the reach of investigators. Even if evidence of a crime can be obtained in the cloud, the related chain of custody can be difficult or impossible to preserve - making evidence potentially inadmissible in court. Those in charge of implementing the law must be aware of these difficulties, and work with cybersecurity experts in government, industry and academia to minimize them. Not-for-profit groups such as the National Cyber-Forensics & Training Alliance in the US and Canada facilitate this sort of collaboration, by bringing together experts from different domains. Traditional borders mean little to cybercriminals, and the laws they break must transcend physical boundaries. Standards must be developed to harmonize different legal definitions of cybercrime, and to facilitate cross-jurisdictional cooperation among nations. Evolving technology must be continuously monitored, and legislators must be properly informed regarding cybersecurity in order for them to create logical and effective laws and policies. The time to establish precedent is now, before cybercrime becomes more problematic. Failure to do so may result in legal quagmires and long winded debates over issues that should have already been settled, as regulators struggle to play catch-up.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.38"
"4.714","The Asian Century","","Public debate about the relationship between Australia and the US, and how a pivot to Australia’s regional neighbours in Asia should be balanced with traditional ties to the world’s dominant superpower, has intensified. Australia’s relationship with the US will remain the bedrock of the nation’s foreign policy for the foreseeable future. However, the hardening of US policy in relation to longstanding allies under the presidency of Donald Trump presents challenges. A choice does not need to be made between the continued special relationship shared by Australia and the US, and greater engagement with Asia. Rather, it is a question of in which direction Australia should turn at any given time for the most dynamic economic opportunities. The backdrop for this is the notion of the coming Asian Century, when the region promises to emerge as the world’s foremost economic powerhouse centred on China and India. Over the past 20 years or so, these countries have increased their economic size almost six-fold, and tripled their share of the global economy. If this momentum is maintained, by 2050 Asia will be home to most of the world’s middle-class consumers, and could account for half of all global economic output. As a wealthy, well-regulated country on Asia’s doorstep, Australia has the potential to make a significant regional contribution. A government paper has noted that Australia is the only major developed economy with preferential access to all major North Asian markets. China’s $1 trillion Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to link Eurasia, Africa, and Oceania via massive investment in infrastructure, presents tremendous economic opportunities. While dozens of nations have signed up to the initiative, Australia has yet to do so. Critics fear increased Chinese political influence. Still, in the roughly 40 years since Gough Whitlam became the first Australian prime minister to visit China, the country’s relations with Asian countries have become more open. The country receives more tourists from China than the United Kingdom and the US, and as of 2017 roughly 2.4 million Australians were of Asian descent, while all but 3.5% of the nearly 700,000 international students in Australian schools and universities were from Asian countries. Still, while the majority of universities in the country have courses or institutes for Asian studies, the number of students learning an Asian language remains small - despite government efforts to increase interest.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.14"
"4.715","The Case for Gender Parity","","While the economic case for gender parity has been made again and again since the release of the first edition of the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report in 2006, more attention must be paid to the issue - in order to ensure adequate, wide-scale support for addressing inequalities. There is a clear, values-based case for promoting gender parity: women make up half of the world’s population and deserve equal access to health, education, earning potential and economic participation, as well as to political decision-making. Gender parity is a fundamental part of thriving societies, and increased gender parity in education can lower infant and child mortality rates, increase labour force participation and earnings, and foster greater investment in children’s education. Meanwhile in the political sphere, women’s engagement in public life has been proven to have a broad, positive impact on social inequality. In an effort to determine the most pressing gender-related issues that need to be addressed, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development distributed questionnaires in 2016. The following year, the OECD published the results; the most commonly-selected issue was violence against women, which, the OECD noted, remains a pandemic, as an estimated 35% of all women worldwide have experienced physical or sexual intimate partner violence, or non-partner sexual violence. According to the OECD, the second-most-commonly selected issue in the questionnaire was women being paid less than men for the same work. As highlighted in the Forum’s 2017 edition of the Global Gender Gap Report, ensuring the full participation of half of the world’s talent pool affects the economic growth, competitiveness, and future-readiness of businesses and entire economies. According to PwC’s Women in Work Index 2017, achieving economic gender parity could add an additional $250 billion to the United Kingdom’s GDP, $1.75 billion to that of the US, $320 billion to that of Japan, and $310 billion to the GDP of Germany. China, meanwhile, could add $2.5 trillion to its GDP by 2020 by closing its gender gap, according to a report published by McKinsey & Company in 2015. For business leaders, addressing barriers to gender equality can unlock new opportunities. In the Forum’s 2016 Future of Jobs survey, for example, business leaders reported that addressing parity issues within their workforces could better match the changing gender composition of their customer base, and therefore enhance corporate decision-making and innovation.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.63"
"4.716","The China Effect","","China is now the largest market for the chemical and materials industry, and the most important source of growth for chemical demand. By 2013, China accounted for one third of the global chemicals market, and that figure is expected to reach 40% by the year 2020. At that point, in terms of total value, China’s chemicals market is expected to be worth roughly $2 trillion (out of a total of roughly $5 trillion in global market value). The chemicals behemoth that would result from the anticipated merger of China’s Sinochem Group and China National Chemical Corporation (ChemChina) would control more than $100 billion in assets, and boost the already substantial role of China in the industry. Despite the country’s ongoing trade friction with the US and broader economic deceleration expected for 2019, the near-term outlook for the chemicals industry in China appears to be solid - and it is expected to remain the world’s largest and fastest-growing. Not long after ChemChina’s $43 billion purchase of Swiss agrochemical giant Syngenta in 2017, marking China’s biggest overseas takeover at that point, a number of countries began to more aggressively limit their openness to acquisitions by Chinese firms. Germany and other European Union countries have established mechanisms to review foreign investments, and in late 2018 Germany implemented rules that enable the government to intervene in the public interest if a non-European purchaser buys a stake in a domestic company of 10% or more. China’s chemical and materials industry is delving into more specialized markets and is becoming more selective about growth (a growing number of domestic Chinese companies are entering the specialty chemicals market). In addition, the tightening of environmental regulation, and more importantly of the implementation of this regulation (with the backing of the emerging urban middle class), is profoundly influencing the industry’s strategic decisions. Meanwhile the localization of production, procurement, and especially research and development are likely to continue to create greater value and locally-adapted products, and further boost competitiveness.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.28"
"4.717","The Common Good","","There are positive signals to be found in surveys of young people. Survey results published by the consultancy Deloitte in 2017, for example, based on questions posed to people born after 1982 in 30 different countries, showed that 74% believed multinational companies have the potential to help solve global challenges, nearly nine in 10 believed the success of a business should be measured by more than just its financial performance, and more than half felt personally accountable for the protection of the environment. Increasingly, and particularly among young people, the notion of a narrowly defined shareholder economy, based on investor demands and the bottom line, is being replaced with the concept of a broader, multi-stakeholder economy, where the interests of workers, consumers, community groups, governments, and environmental advocates all have a say in economic decision-making. Companies that pursue positive contributions to society are acting on more than a desire for global well-being; evidence suggests companies that actively value more than just profit find it easier to recruit and retain staff, and can also financially outperform businesses whose sole stated purpose is to maximize shareholder value. According to a study published in 2017 by the consultancy BCG, consumer packaged goods companies with socially-responsible sourcing had gross profit margins that were 4.8 percentage points higher than their peers, while biopharmaceutical companies that were top performers in terms of expanding access to drugs had margins that were 8.2 percentage points higher than peers. Individual business leaders stand to benefit from an association with social or environmental responsibility; in 2015, the Harvard Business Review began factoring in an “environmental, social and governance,” or ESG element in scoring for the publication’s annual Best Performing CEOs in the World list. The winner for 2017, Inditex CEO Pablo Isla, was elevated to the top spot thanks to his ESG score (ESG-rating rating firms had singled out for praise Inditex’s transparency when it came to managing, monitoring and auditing its supply chain).","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.131"
"4.718","The Cost of Climate Change","","The environmental impacts of climate change are already evident in Australia, in the form of an accelerating increase in average seasonal temperatures, the vulnerability of coastal areas, and a growing number of extreme weather events. Climate change has brought an increase in flooding and violent storms, more intense tropical cyclones, and a greater number of hot days that have wrought out-of-control bushfires. Meanwhile shifting patterns of rainfall have been linked to prolonged drought. These changes have exceeded natural variability, and their effects on agricultural production, cattle and sheep farming, water and energy supplies, and housing and infrastructure have ranged from severe to catastrophic. For example, the Millennium Drought in South Eastern Australia, from 1996 to 2010, has been described as the worst in the country’s recorded history. The region’s inland river system collapsed into a series of sandy, shallow ponds, and has yet to fully recover; crop production declined dramatically, and the normally lucrative cotton-growing industry suffered; populations of native and farm animals were decimated; and the densely-populated eastern seaboard resorted to rationing water. There were also increasing incidences of drought-related suicides and mental illness, especially in rural areas. Ultimately, federal government funding for drought assistance amounted to AUD 4.5 billion. In 2016, Australia ratified the Paris climate change agreement and the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol, after having submitted a self-designated target for the reduction of emissions by 2030. Australia’s government has implemented a “Direct Action Plan” for the phasing out of potent synthetic greenhouse gases (including hydrofluorocarbons in refrigerators and air conditioners), the planting of millions of trees, mandating more efficient cars, and improving the utilization of sustainable energy. However, Australia’s climate change researchers have almost unanimously condemned the government’s Direct Action Plan as falling short of necessary emission reduction targets. The Climate Council, an independent, Australia-based non-profit, has pointed out that government calculations mask the bleak realities of climate change. The organization has advised that in order to have a 75% chance of staying below the widely-recognized threshold of a two degree centigrade rise in temperature above pre-industrial levels, Australia would need to reduce its emissions by 60% by 2030. Anything greater than a two degree increase could mean a melting Greenland ice-sheet, which may result in the inundation of most of Australia’s major cities. According to researchers, imaginative initiatives are needed that build on existing renewable energy technologies, and can navigate political and financial obstacles.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.14"
"4.719","The Cost of Precision Medicine","","Although Precision Medicine, also referred to as Personalized Medicine, is unlikely to significantly reduce health care costs in the near future, there have been notable exceptions that provide a glimpse of its potential. The genomic characterization of certain cancers, for example, has led to improved molecular diagnostics and specific therapeutics that target unique tumour susceptibilities, illustrating a path forward to delivering more cost-effective, high-quality care. The increasingly routine use of genomic data, accurate clinical phenotyping (measuring the interaction between one’s genetic makeup and the environment), novel biomarkers of disease, and precise target-based therapies all promise to transform the healthcare sector. That in turn should improve health outcomes, lead to a better understanding of disease risks, and eliminate the use of imprecise, expensive diagnostic procedures and ineffective therapies. Ultimately, these changes will likely decrease overall health care costs, and enhance value. However, we have yet to develop a reliable way to routinely integrate these technologies. While the capability and cost of generating high-quality DNA sequence information has improved exponentially, the annotation of genes, regulatory elements, DNA variants, and post-translational protein modifications lag behind. In addition, our understanding of the complex molecular pathways occurring within cells and organs, and their relationships to human development, ageing, disease, and environment remain rudimentary.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.109"
"4.720","The Demography, Skills and Migration Nexus","","Germany has a particularly weak demographic outlook; its population is not only shrinking, it is also getting older. According to the World Bank, 21.5% of Germany’s population was aged 65 or older by 2017 (surpassed only by Japan and Italy), compared with 14.6% of the population in 1987. Key factors behind Germany’s greying population are one of the world’s lowest annual population growth rates - slightly less than 1.2% as of 2016, according to World Bank data - and an above-average life expectancy of nearly 82 years as of 2015, which was above the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average of 80 years. According to the United Nations’ 2017 revision of its World Population Prospects report, Germany’s fertility rate, or live births per woman, is projected to be 1.47 between 2015 and 2020, below the average level of 2.1 required for replacement of the population. Germany’s overall population is expected to fall to about 71 million by 2100, according to the report, from about 82 million in 2017. However, the UN report also noted that Germany will be among the top six countries in the world in terms of net receivers of international migrants between 2015 and 2050. This could alleviate pressure on a shrinking workforce. It would also significantly affect Germany’s ethnic makeup. Amid a recent surge in immigration fuelled by conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa, Germany granted more than 524,000 positive decisions on asylum applications in 2017, or 60% of the total for all European Union members that year, according to Eurostat. While Chancellor Angela Merkel may have spearheaded the so-called “Wilkommenskultur” (welcoming culture) for refugees, domestic opposition and popular dissent have tempered this stance. Controversy tied to immigration has persisted; it contributed to a disappointing result for Merkel’s Christian Democrats in 2017 federal elections, and ultimately helped lead to her resignation as party leader in 2018. The Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian sister-party of Merkel’s Christian Democrats, heads the federal Interior Ministry and oversees immigration matters - and has been willing to jeopardize the governing coalition in order to demonstrate a tougher stance (though this strategy led to poor results in the 2018 Bavarian regional elections, and to the party leader’s resignation).","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.66"
"4.721","The Digital Age","","The digital revolution has ushered in a new era in which power, and the means to acquire and retain it, is being drastically redefined. Europe has largely missed out; the absence of European champions that can vie with the likes of Facebook or Uber, or hardware firms that make the most popular mobile phones, is glaring. A few European stars, such as Spotify or e-commerce firm Zalando, may address this imbalance, though when it comes to “unicorns,” or start-ups privately valued at over $1 billion, the European Union lags behind both the US and China. Many EU member states have reacted to this dynamic with protectionism, by either forbidding or extensively regulating services such as AirBnB and Uber in order to protect existing industries and interest groups. But this is not a long-term answer. The internet has become the most important infrastructure element of the global economy. Within the next five to ten years, the internet will also be the infrastructure upon which all other infrastructures are based, and digital influence has become both a force in foreign policy and an economic mainstay. The European Commission has estimated that an effective digital single market could annually contribute €415 billion to Europe’s economy.  One area in which the EU appears strong is data protection. The EU-US Privacy Shield, and the General Data Protection Regulation implemented in 2018, have built a foundation for protecting the online rights of EU citizens. However, the EU lacks compelling vision for the internet and the digital economy. Because it is still not a fully integrated digital market, the EU is ill-prepared to compete on geopolitical and geo-economic issues. Innovation is the most important aspect of future economic growth in the EU, as it seeks to address the shrinking size of its workforce. Young people need the technology skills necessary to adapt to changing employer needs, and there is a case to be made for flexible education models that allow for life-long learning. The World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index for 2017-2018 pegged Europe’s median score for innovation well below its performance in areas such as health and infrastructure. In light of the speed of technology-driven change occurring around the globe, Europe must embrace its digital future sooner rather than later, in order to maintain its global competitiveness. The creation of a single digital market, for example, could present new opportunities for growth and job creation.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.50"
"4.722","The Disempowered Citizen","","New technology tools for expressing views and demanding public accountability are increasingly finding their way into the hands of an opinionated populace. However, the corresponding indifference of governments and policy-makers has led to the advent of the so-called “(dis)empowered” citizen. A study published by the European Commission in 2016 showed that 81% of public services in the European Union had been made available online, while Twitter has garnered more than 300 million monthly active users and provides a popular platform for people advocating for everything from Black Lives Matter to presidential succession in Zimbabwe. Yet, while individuals may feel empowered by technology that makes it easier to gather information about issues, communicate, and organize social movements, they also increasingly feel unable to have their voices heard by traditional institutions. According to the 2018 Edelman Trust Barometer, a survey conducted in 28 countries, less than half of the general population expressed trust in government institutions and the media, while only slightly more than half expressed trust in businesses and non-governmental organizations (in the US, the portion of the general population expressing trust in government tumbled to 33% from 47% in the prior year). The disempowerment of a citizenry making increased use of technology can also take the form of disinformation. In early 2018, it was revealed that Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm that uses data to influence behaviour and had been hired by Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, was able to improperly keep and use data about Facebook users; allegations have meanwhile been raised about Russian efforts to manipulate US voter opinion online, including on Facebook. In order to counter the negative effects of disempowerment, public officials and institutions have developed potential solutions designed to enable people to take a more active role in public life. So-called “citizen science,” for example, can help people actively participate (offline and online) in collecting and assessing the information that is ultimately used to develop policies. In the US, NASA, for example, said in 2018 it had selected a handful of citizen science projects for development, which should enable volunteers from the public to collect observations to be shared with established researchers as open data; an animal biodiversity project, for example, uses mobile phones to record bird sounds, which are fed onto a cloud-based platform and combined with satellite data in order to produce maps of species’ presence, and assess how fires affect bird communities.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.33"
"4.723","The Economic Value of Digital Identity","","In a study of seven countries published in 2019, the McKinsey Global Institute estimated that providing digital identities could result in added economic value equal to as much as 13% of GDP by 2030, save 110 billion hours via e-government services, and help the estimated 1.7 billion people who remain without access to formal financial services - often as a result of a lack of documentation. Businesses could meanwhile benefit from improved efficiency, lowered costs and fraud reduction, and save up to $1.6 trillion thanks to digital identities, according to the study. Estonia, for example, facilitates public services including healthcare, banking, and voting via a digital identity system; in 2014 alone it was used over 80 million times for authentication and 35 million times for digital transactions, it saves people an estimated five days per year that would otherwise be spent dealing with bureaucracy, and it cuts costs equivalent to 2% of GDP. Meanwhile India’s “Aadhaar” digital identity system is a centralized, national means to promote social inclusion and access to government services - as of 2017, it covered 95% of the population and had saved the government an estimated $9 billion by reducing fraud, according to Deloitte and the Center for Global Development. The travel and tourism industry in particular should see economic benefits from the use of digital identities. As international air arrivals increase by an expected 50% between 2016 and 2030, according to the World Tourism Organization, concepts like Known Traveller Digital Identity, developed by a group of governments and businesses, could ease the pressure by using biometric and biographical data to quickly assess risk and verify identities. In the supply chain industry, digital identity can help combat counterfeit goods, which constitute about 3% of global trade, according to the OECD; companies including BMW and IBM are members of the Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative, for example, which uses blockchain to reduce the use of counterfeit replacement parts in order to enhance safety and increase transparency. Digital identities can also be used to verify businesses online; Singapore created “CorpPass” to help facilitate digital transactions between businesses and the government, and the governments of British Columbia, Ontario, and Canada created the “Verifiable Organizations Network” to digitize government-issued credentials for businesses like registrations, permits, and licenses. Stakeholders in every sector and industry should be investing in digital identity as a foundational infrastructure, designing flexible solutions, and unlocking more identity use cases.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.41"
"4.724","The Environment and Oil","","Environmental concerns are driving energy-related public policies aimed at addressing climate change by decarbonizing. The Paris Agreement on climate change, ratified in 2016 as hundreds of national governments made voluntary related commitments, could have a broad impact; however, the Paris Agreement commitments are widely seen as insufficient to achieve the deal’s stated goal of capping temperature rise well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. This in turn has spurred calls for more policy action (there is growing interest in carbon-pricing policies like a carbon tax or carbon-permit trading, for example). The COP24 global climate talks in Poland in late 2018 did not do much to address concerns raised by the Paris signatories related to a report that had just been published by the UN scientific panel on climate change - which warned of dramatic consequences from just 1.5°C of warming. These concerns were tied to efforts by oil and gas exporters Russia, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the US to weaken a statement endorsing the UN panel’s report, to the need to reduce fossil fuel use in countries where alternative energy supplies may be unavailable, and to a need for the developed world to help fund decarbonization in the developing world. Local environmental concerns have prompted policies that have attracted international media attention - like the targets set in France, the United Kingdom, and Norway to entirely eliminate internal combustion engines in the next few decades. Efforts with a similar intent can vary widely, however, depending on an individual country’s level of development, degree of economic diversification, and existing energy mix. Local sentiment will have a big influence on the types of policies that can be adopted; the gilets jaunes (“yellow jackets”) protests that pushed France to scrap a fuel tax increase in late 2018, and the failure of the state of Washington in the US to pass a carbon tax, underlined the fact that people are deeply concerned about the personal cost of cleaner energy and a cleaner environment. Major international oil and gas corporations increasingly recognize the importance of transitioning to more sustainable energy in the future. Spurred by shareholders and public sentiment, these companies have invested greater amounts in renewable energy, and have launched initiatives to promote more sustainable and environmentally responsible oil and gas development and production (such as the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, an effort organized by the World Economic Forum in partnership with more than a dozen oil and gas companies).","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.104"
"4.725","The Flowering of Financial Technology","","There has been an explosion of investment in financial technology, or fintech, designed to digitalize and democratize everything from payments to lending. Global investment in fintech companies totaled $57.9 billion in the first half of 2018 alone, according to a report published by KPMG; that included a single, $14 billion round of funding round for Chinese payments firm Ant Financial. Investment was distributed around the world, according to the report, with a firm in Brazil reaching $1 billion-valuation-status and top venture deals in Europe spread across five countries - though much of the activity was centered in China. That country saw four different, $100 million-plus venture capital rounds in fintech firms in the first half of 2018, according to the report, and local fintechs have started shifting focus to Southeast Asia as a next growth step. On the flip side of this entrepreneurial activity, many established banks have begun making efforts to tap into novel facets of fintech - by partnering with accelerator programs that foster startups, for example, in order gain exposure to talent and develop pilot programs based on artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and robotics.   Quantum computing, which involves manipulating quantum bits that can store more information than standard computer bits, has drawn particular interest from banks (and other companies) due to its potential to crunch information hundreds of thousands of times faster than traditional computing. Banks including JP Morgan Chase, Barclays, and Mizuho have joined IBM’s Q Network, a quantum computing system unveiled in 2017 that can potentially be used to accelerate trading and risk analysis. Distributed ledger technologies, like blockchain, have also drawn significant interest. Blockchain, which can provide a comprehensive record of transactions where every change is recorded for all to see, is being explored by banks including UBS, which together with other institutions founded a blockchain-based global trading platform called Batavia. Meanwhile HSBC announced in 2018 that together with ING Bank it had successfully executed a live trade financial transaction using blockchain tied to the shipment of soybeans from Argentina to Malaysia. Ultimately, many institutions are interested in using multiple technologies to create platforms - which strengthen every time they draw in a new user. Successful examples of platforms include Stripe, the payments service that provides technology and fraud prevention infrastructure.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.52"
"4.726","The Future of Democracy","","Much political debate in Australia is centred on the issue of whether democratic norms continue to form the bedrock of the country’s cultural life. According to doomsayers, the liberal values and attitudes essential to a healthy democracy are in terminal decay. It is true that the mood of voters is one of alienation from traditional political parties, including the centre-right Labor Party, the conservative Liberal Party, and the centre-left Greens. While voting in Australia is compulsory, there has been a decline in turnout. This reflects growing public sentiment that parliamentary leadership is self-serving and directionless, and incapable of crafting a hopeful vision of the future. For pessimists, the widening of fault lines in democratic governance is reflected in a corresponding decline of trust in institutions such as the church, trade unions, political parties, universities, the media, and major banks, all of which have historically been looked to as emblematic of an open, stable culture. Only about 8% of the population attends church weekly, amid findings by a government commission of institutional corruption and paedophilia. Trade unions and banks are meanwhile perceived as vulnerable to corruption and the abuse of power. The mainstream media, which must compete for attention with social media, is widely regarded as superficial. Meanwhile universities are often deemed to be out of touch and preoccupied by revenue demands. Overall, there is a perception that contemporary Australia is now fragmented, and that it is more sympathetic to the xenophobic, racist views of extremist political parties such as One Nation. Many Australians, however, perceive conservative nostalgia for a secure past that never was as nonsense. They see democracy as a dynamic process of backsliding and advances. Like other countries, Australia has a long history of racism and homophobia, which have been addressed by anti-discrimination legislation. In 2017, a plebiscite on legalizing same sex marriage saw around two thirds vote in favour. Meanwhile there has been widespread condemnation of Australia’s offshore detention of asylum seekers. While many Australians may share a perception that their country is badly governed, this does not necessarily indicate they are alienated from democracy. Rather, it calls for more imaginative policies. After all, Australians are generally a talented, adaptable people who have managed to navigate the global economic and political upheaval of the last quarter century relatively unscathed.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.14"
"4.727","The Gamification of Life and Reality Distortion","","Augmented reality (AR) means that our daily life has the potential to expand beyond what is visible to the human eye. In his concept film, Hyper Reality, designer Keiichi Matsuda explored how the contours of urban environments can extend beyond physical structures to include a superimposed virtual layer made up of digital information. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook posited that AR games would have a more enduring commercial appeal than virtual reality ones over time in a February 2017 interview with The Independent. He may have been thinking about the immense success of Niantic’s Pokemon GO augmented reality game, released in mid-2016. The game, which turned people’s everyday lives into a playing field, sparked both positive and negative media coverage. Some heralded the software as clever for reintroducing physical activity into our often sedentary digital lives; others highlighted how nefarious figures were taking advantage of and robbing the immersed game players. Game designer Raph Koster has called for virtual and augmented reality game designers to heed the lessons of games past because in creating a game, a designer is actually creating a virtual community or society, and without a well-thought out design, there is the potential for human behaviour to go awry. In 2017, the social media company Snap extended its popular face filters with a new feature called, World Lenses, in which game-like 3D stickers can be added into video messages, blending real and virtual content seamlessly for the purpose of communication and experience sharing. As computing power continues to grow and new algorithms are being developed, visual effects-quality AR alterations are foreseeable in the near future. In a few years, we will no longer need a traditional expensive visual effects pipeline to create any type of content for AR. Also, when this technology becomes widely-available – for example, perhaps as widely available as any smartphone integrated video editor - the lines between physical and virtual reality will continue to blur. In the meantime, researchers from the University of Southern California, Stanford University and the University of Washington are advancing video manipulation techniques to alter facial expressions, lip motions and dialogues, fostering the ability to generate believable fake news and cyber propaganda.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.133"
"4.728","The Geo-economic and Trade Impacts of 5G","","5G is designed to be a foundation connecting billions of devices and enabling better ways of doing things. The total number of 5G subscriptions is projected to reach 2.6 billion by 2025 - prompting optimism about its practical uses, and a need for device manufacturers to adapt strategy. Those countries able to take a leading position in the deployment of 5G are expected to enjoy relatively greater economic growth - though exact implementation will depend on unique national priorities and challenges. According to a report published in 2019 by GSMA, a trade organization for mobile operators, 5G services provided on millimetre wave (“mmWave”) spectrum should increase GDP by $5.2 billion in Sub-Saharan Africa by the year 2034, by bolstering vital functions like port logistics and helping to better coordinate the movement of goods. 5G can also be one of many (potentially unrelated) factors behind trade tensions and geo-economic positioning; in 2019, for example, China established a two-year action plan to promote the purchase of consumer goods including 5G handsets as a means to offset the impact of an escalating trade war with the US. In a related geo-economic move, legislation was introduced in the US in 2019 intended to boost the presence of American firms in global industry standards bodies - in a bid to check China’s influence on future 5G networks. 5G is a key factor behind tensions between the world’s two largest economies; the US has expressed security-related concerns about China’s status as a leader in 5G technology development and implementation, and about its acquisition of related intellectual property rights. China is likely to be the first nation to launch a 5G telecom network at scale, and as it plays a significant role in setting global standards both Huawei and ZTE have been among the biggest filers of related patents. Overall, China holds a significant percentage of 5G-related technology patents, and a far higher share than was the case with 3G or 4G at a comparable stage in development. Eventually, China may come to hold nearly a third of global 5G-related patents, according to one estimate, and it continues to participate actively in international standards-setting bodies like the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.1"
"4.729","The Geopolitics of Mining","","A growing popular resistance to globalization and free trade is altering politics, and directly affecting the mining and metals sector. For example, policy-makers in the places where mines operate are increasingly trying to enact local content laws and regulations, which require minerals to be processed (and therefore gain in value) before they are exported. Meanwhile import restrictions on semi-finished products such as steel and aluminium have triggered recent trade disputes; full-blown trade wars and increased protectionism would likely lead to lower global commodity demand, and disrupt mining and metals companies, while an increase in local content regulations could increase production costs for individual mining projects. On the flip side, increased protectionism could actually provide opportunities for domestic mining companies, and for those that are vertically integrated (or, in control of multiple stages of a supply chain), as they can provide solutions that go beyond the simple extraction of minerals. Best practices for navigating these and other geopolitical risks include maintaining good relationships with domestic joint venture partners where mines are located, and securing access to countries with high consumer demand. When it comes to minerals that are essential for promising renewable-energy technologies, geopolitical risk has been further complicated by market consolidation. China, for example, has secured its own supply of critical minerals such as lithium, cobalt, and rare earths, while developing a dominant market position by acquiring mining projects, forging resource-for-infrastructure deals with mineral producing countries (one example is an arrangement with the Democratic Republic of Congo to provide billions of dollars worth of infrastructure in exchange for access to copper mining), promoting domestic production, and gaining control of key components of the mineral and technology value chain. Countries that must rely on imports and are wary of supply disruptions have examined ways to hinder Chinese-backed takeovers, and to avoid having to rely on Chinese companies. Further consolidation, geopolitical manoeuvring, and muscle flexing could create challenges for companies that have so far prospered under a system of relatively free trade - while creating opportunities for domestic projects that might not be economically viable without government intervention.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.99"
"4.730","The Global Luxury Market","","By the end of 2017, the global luxury goods market was recovering from economic uncertainty and geopolitical crises, and was approaching an estimated $1 trillion in size, according to a report published by Deloitte. However, while China is expected to remain among the fastest-growing luxury markets, according to the report, the US market may be hindered by a lack of wage growth, and uncertainty looms of the United Kingdom’s market due to Brexit, a weakened pound, and declining purchasing power. These economic and political realities, along with changing luxury consumer demands, are forcing retailers to rethink both the goods that they sell and how they sell them. Luxury sales growth is now being driven by millennials and Generation Z (generally considered to include people born in the mid-90’s and after), according to the report, meaning that these groups must now be catered to with more personalized experiences that blend offline and online offerings - via means including “voice commerce” conducted through the Internet of Things, augmented reality, and artificial intelligence. One example cited in the Deloitte report is Gucci, the Italian fashion house, which saw online sales increase by 86% in 2017 and which now relies on millennials for about half of its total revenue; Gucci has reinvented itself for younger buyers via its “geek-chic” efforts, and redesigned its website in 2016 to provide visual presentations and stories, and personalized customer service through webchat. Much like artisanal manufacturers, luxury brands will need to justify the value of their products based on more than just their appearance and immediate utility. Increasingly, luxury consumers are seeking experiences in the form of travel, hotels, restaurants, and bespoke opportunities (a concept first advanced by B. Joseph Pine and James Gilmore in a 1998 Harvard Business Review article). Luxury travel provider Black Tomato, for example, offers a service that has travellers show up at the airport without knowing where they are headed - before dropping them in a mystery location where they must rely on their “wits and inner steel” in order to complete an expedition. Because what starts as a luxury for the elite often goes mainstream, experience and individuation will likely become bigger parts of the broader global retail market.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.114"
"4.731","The Great Jobs Challenge","","India now finds itself in a demographic sweet spot, as a country of roughly 1.3 billion people with more than half of its citizens of working age. The ratio of working age population to non-working age population is expected to peak around 2041, according to the country’s Economic Survey 2018-2019. According to the latest available data, India’s current workforce stands at 473 million, and about 300 million more will be added by 2040 (an estimated one million Indians join the labour market each month, according to Labour Ministry data). Meanwhile millions of people are ditching agricultural work; about 50 million people left farm work behind between 2004 and 2015. The Indian economy must provide quality jobs for new labour market entrants, as well as for those who are transitioning from agriculture. This challenge is even more acute when it comes to women who have left the workforce over the past two decades, and are now trying to get back in. Solutions must also be found for the majority of Indians who are currently either self-employed, or working in the informal, grey economy. India’s job challenge can be seen in terms of three overlapping issues: the quality of human capital, infrastructure, and labour-intensive growth (the first issue is dealt with separately within this Transformation Map). The International Monetary Fund estimates that infrastructure investment equal to roughly 1% of GDP in advanced economies produces a 1.5% GDP increase on average over four years. For India, it has been estimated that increasing infrastructure investment by 0.5% of GDP will boost growth by 1.8% in the medium to long term. So far, India has not been able to replicate the successful, employment-intensive manufacturing found in other Asian countries plugged into global supply chains, such as Viet Nam and Bangladesh. Relatively strict labour laws are one obstacle - these laws also exclude the large section of the workforce employed informally, who are neither entitled to social security benefits nor have access to training. At the same time, highly-productive enterprises are demanding less labour even as they become more capital intensive. Suggestions for reform in this area include legalizing contract labour, and extending the social security net to informal, grey economy workers.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.77"
"4.732","The Human Side of Risk","","Forces like political polarization, rising inequality, and major technological advances are both disrupting the geopolitical landscape and having a heavy impact on individuals. For many people, this is an increasingly anxious, unhappy, and lonely world. Globally, mental health problems now affect an estimated 700 million people, profoundly impacting personal lives. In the face of precariousness caused by social, technological, and work-related transformations, many are experiencing a feeling of loss of control. This has in turn made significant polarization an increasingly prevalent feature of politics in many countries (some of the potential drivers of emotional stress considered in the World Economic Forum’s 2019 Global Risks Report are social, technological, and work-related). Coupled with this increased political polarization, inequality can erode a country’s social fabric in an economically damaging way; as cohesion and trust diminish, economic performance is likely to weaken. In affluent countries, wealth affects well-being in particularly complex ways - the prevalence of anxiety disorders is higher among lower-income groups, for example. But attitudes towards money matter, too - researchers have linked reduced well-being to broad, societal shifts away from motivations related to community feeling and affiliation, and towards motivations related to financial success and social status. Technological change is always a source of stress, but the current wave of change is defined by a particularly unnerving blurring of lines between humans and technology. This is leading to rapid transformations in the workplace, and what happens at work has the potential to affect emotional and psychological well-being everywhere (according to a survey of full-time employees in 155 countries, just 15% felt “highly involved in and enthusiastic about their work”). For many people, one pronounced, recent change has been a blurring of the distinction between work and the rest of life. Work-related emails now often begin long before the start of nominal working hours, and finish long afterwards. Many families juggle multiple jobs with childcare, stressful commuting logistics, and caring for elderly parents. Profound changes in the structure of work and in its place in society are a further source of potential stress. Job security and stability are in decline in many advanced economies, with real earnings growth stagnating as less predictable, “gig economy” work proliferates. In many low-income countries, meanwhile, secure and stable employment has always been the exception; 70% of employment in Sub-Saharan Africa is classified as “vulnerable” by the International Labour Organization.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.70"
"4.733","The Human and Environmental Cost of Batteries","","More than half of the world’s cobalt, a key ingredient in the lithium-ion batteries used to power iPhones and electric cars, comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo - and about one fifth of it is mined by hand, according to a report published in 2017 by Amnesty International. Amnesty said in the report it had documented both children and adults in the country mining cobalt in narrow, man-made tunnels where they risked fatal accidents and lung disease. As the use of electric mobility becomes more mainstream, demand for the raw materials that make it possible will surge. Demand for cobalt, for example, is projected to increase to about 170 kilotonnes per year by the year 2030, according to a report published in 2019 by the International Energy Agency, while demand for lithium is expected to increase to roughly 155 kilotonnes per year. In addition to human rights concerns tied to cobalt mining, there are worries that there simply may not be enough to go around; a 2018 European Commission publication projected that the metal may be in short supply starting in 2025. Efforts are being made to better track the sourcing of the materials necessary to foster the growth of more environmentally-friendly electric transportation, and facilitate digital communication. The World Economic Forum’s Global Battery Alliance, for example, includes members like the African Development Bank, Google, and Honda Motors, and has formed both a cobalt working group focused on the Democratic Republic of the Congo that is designed to ensure small-scale mining does not employ child labour, and a lithium working group focused on Latin America. Efforts are also being made to draw greater attention to the environmental problems associated with mining the elements necessary for the batteries powering cars and electronics. Both miners in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and people living in communities near these mines are often exposed to high levels of toxic metals, and studies have shown a link between the presence of mines and birth defects, according to a report published by the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative and the United Nations Global Compact in 2018.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.19"
"4.734","The New Saudi Economy","","Saudi Arabia is committing significant resources to efforts to diversify away from oil dependence and overwhelmingly public sector-based employment, by fostering the growth of a more dynamic and innovative economy. The fiscal case for diversification is clear; the International Monetary Fund has estimated that the country's government needs the price of oil to be at least $70 per barrel merely in order to hit a fiscal breakeven point. While the price of oil recovered during 2018 so that it surpassed $70 per barrel, it has since dipped lower amid concerns about global economic growth. Saudi Arabia has made efforts to diversify away from oil in the past, though they have generally fallen short. Exceptions include the establishment of “industrial cities” at Jubail and Yanbu, which are centred on petrochemicals production. A key element of the Saudi government’s “Vision 2030” plan, unveiled in 2016, is a move towards further diversification. One option in this regard for Saudi Arabia is to develop greater oil refining capabilities, which could in turn fund the development of new industries. At a more fundamental level, Saudi Arabia needs to ensure that its education system is imparting the skills necessary for graduates to successfully pursue entrepreneurship and innovation. While many young Saudis have studied abroad in locations such as the US and the United Kingdom, the kingdom now envisions an enhancement of local educational institutions - exemplified by the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, or KAUST, which was founded in 2009 and offers graduate study programs in English. Saudi Arabia is also pursuing the development of a knowledge-based economy by developing four science and technology-focused “economic cities” in Rabigh, Hail, Madinah, and Jazan. In addition, the country is investing an estimated $100 billion to develop the King Abdullah Economic City, which is designed to draw foreign investment focused on fields including manufacturing and pharmaceuticals. Meanwhile the kingdom’s “Neom” project, unveiled in 2017, envisions a massive, metropolitan area that hosts industries including media, biotechnology, and renewable energy. The success of these ambitious projects will depend upon attracting the necessary investment and talent, fostering a culture of innovation, and successfully managing security and political risks.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.117"
"4.735","The Oil and Gas Workforce","","The oil and gas industry faces many challenges related to its workforce: difficulty in attracting and retaining the best talent, a lack of qualified technical professionals in emerging markets, gaps due to cyclical hiring tied to oil price fluctuations, and a need to re-skill its broader talent pool in the era of increasing digitalization. These issues take on varying degrees of significance in different regions around the world - but taken together they create significant amounts of general uncertainty. An adequate university education for a petro-technical professional should include technical skills, project management fundamentals, and professional skills in areas like finance, health, safety, environmental sustainability, and computer science. Analyses have suggested that the quality of engineering undergraduates varies widely based on school and region - mostly due to limited teaching capabilities, inadequate facilities, and a lack of sufficient funding and training programmes in developing countries. The oil and gas industry’s human capital challenge is exacerbated by the under-representation of women in its workforce - which results from gender imbalances in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields at universities, from negative public perception of the industry, and from proven difficulties in retaining mid-career, female talent. The World Economic Forum’s 2016 Future of Jobs report noted that while women accounted for about 35% of all STEM graduates globally, in the energy industry only 24% of junior-level employees, 19% of mid-level employees, and just 11% of senior employees were women. As it seeks to address its gender issues, the industry’s workforce will also be affected by digitalization. Some jobs may disappear, while new opportunities will likely emerge. For example, many roles traditionally filled on offshore rigs can now be done remotely, potentially improving safety while changing the nature of related tasks (well logging and directional drilling are examples of potentially affected work). The Fourth Industrial Revolution promises to require evolving digital skills, even in traditional jobs - making an ability to digitally train and re-train talent critical.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.104"
"4.736","The Paris Agreement","","The Paris Agreement was negotiated at the annual United Nations climate summit in 2015, and provides a means for participating countries to respond to the environmental, social, and economic effects of climate change. The agreement was a significant milestone, because it managed to formulate a consensus on the need to limit the rise in global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. The 181 countries that ratified the deal are expected to submit specific pledges to reduce their contributions to emissions, and to help the places most vulnerable to climate change adapt. One of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, which were adopted in 2015 to guide development for the next 15 years, encourages countries to incorporate their climate commitments into national policies, and urges companies to de-carbonize their operations and supply chains. In addition, the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol (on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer) bolsters the Paris Agreement, by preventing the equivalent of an estimated 1 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions every year (in total, about 35 billion tons of yearly emissions result from human activity). More broadly, the Montreal Protocol has helped to reverse shrinkage of the ozone layer, which protects against harmful radiation from the sun. It is an encouraging example of a multinational agreement that can solve real climate problems. Public commitments targeting greenhouse-gas emissions are generally gaining momentum, but not everywhere. In 2017, the Trump Administration announced its intention to withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement at the earliest allowed date (which under the rules would be in late 2020). Brazil may follow. In 2018, the US Environmental Protection Agency proposed new rules to weaken the emissions limits set for coal-fired power plants in 2015. Despite such setbacks, and a spike in carbon-dioxide emissions in 2017 following a two-year pause, the UN climate summit held in late 2018 in Poland ended on a positive note. Delegates from 195 countries reached an agreement on what counts towards a reported reduction of their emissions, and on assigning responsibility to monitor progress on pledged goals. Developed countries meanwhile made firmer commitments to finance efforts to reduce the growing emissions generated by developing countries, which in turn agreed to uniform tracking standards.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.34"
"4.737","The Primacy of Values","","In developed countries like Germany, Japan, and South Korea, the percentage of the population aged 65 and older is rising sharply - in Japan, that figure jumped to 27% by 2017 from 15% in 1997, according to the World Bank. Meanwhile in the developing world, including India and many parts of Africa, relatively youthful populations mean more young people are joining the workforce. It is values that will shape how governments respond to these trends - by informing how (and even whether) they provide social support and protections, education, and training for the jobs of the future. Values can therefore be essential tools for blunting the impact of populist messages that play on perceptions of inequality. Values will also play an essential role as technology generates ever-larger volumes of potentially accessible personal data; they will shape the privacy regimes determining how that data are used. Human-centred policies will be critical as governments face these kinds of daunting issues, all of which require more than simple templates. Social values will be key for prioritizing well-being as governments guide the development and use of emerging technologies that need to be addressed now, at a relatively early stage. Agility can enable policy-making that is more inclusive and human-centred by involving more stakeholders in the process, and by allowing for successive iteration until the needs of the governed are met. Agile governance can also ensure long-term sustainability by creating mechanisms to constantly monitor and upgrade policies meant to govern new technologies, as well as by facilitating burden-sharing with non-governmental actors - while maintaining necessary checks and balances. Increased agility in policy-making can also address “policy decay” - or the idea that policies inevitably lose their relevance over time, especially as technological development accelerates. Robust and rigorous public discussion about values can help build a collective capacity to assess the ethics of emerging technology, and strong education systems will be key for ensuring that values are absorbed early in life, and transmitted broadly.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.8"
"4.738","The Promise of the Internet of Things","","The Internet of Things connects appliances, gadgets, and devices, enabling them to transmit data online. The increased connectivity of ordinary objects like a dishwasher can facilitate innovation and efficiency, and create new risks. Related questions have emerged about expectations for privacy, and the appropriate use of personal data. More connected devices means that more devices need to be secured against hackers; while hacking the location of a car may be an invasion of privacy, hacking a car’s control system could be life-threatening. Current internet infrastructure was not developed with these security concerns in mind. According to a survey in the World Economic Forum’s 2015 report Industrial Internet of Things, 72% of respondents saw industrial applications of IoT as disruptive, 78% predicted the disruption would be fully felt within five years, and 88% felt businesses were not ready for it. Electronics sector players have to prepare for the increased connectivity of their products, and related risk. According to the Forum’s report, the emergence of the so-called outcome economy means that companies will shift from supplying products, to outcome-based services. This will redefine business models, blur traditional industry boundaries, create new markets and partnerships, increase human-machine collaboration, and potentially enhance efficiency. Related risks for businesses and governments include vulnerability to cyberattacks and espionage, the potential lack of inter-operability among systems, uncertain returns on investment in new technologies, a lack of data governance regulation for cross-border transactions, and a potential shortage of necessary digital skills. The implications for industry leaders are many. While technology providers can develop test beds to share best security practices and safety guidelines, policy-makers should update the rules for traditional industries in order to encourage innovation. Cross-border data flows need to be streamlined, while industry and government should collaborate more on making investments in long-term technology research and development, and in new training programmes to fill digital talent gaps. One sign of industry momentum is the emergence of associations aiming to address the growing need for collaboration on common concerns such as security and inter-operability - such as the Industrial Internet Consortium, the AllSeen Alliance, and the Open Connectivity Foundation. Going forward, telecommunications and automobile companies in particular will be uniquely positioned to influence the industry, given their millions of existing subscriber relationships and decades of experience in driving collaboration.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.45"
"4.739","The Regulatory Environment for 5G","","A number of different countries are trying to influence the regulatory environment for 5G in their respective regions of the world. Japan and China, for example, have focused their efforts on spectrum bands that can potentially ensure compatibility with the US and South Korea, while the European Union has decided to pursue frequencies between 24.25 GHz and 27.5 GHz as a pioneer 5G band. Regulators and governments may want 5G to succeed, but their interpretations of what constitutes network neutrality vary, according to a report published by PwC in 2019 - and governments need to appreciate that 5G requires a new regulatory approach. Operators should engage with regulators by putting forward real-world use cases and pressing for incentives that will justify their 5G-related investments, according to the report. According to the results of a survey published by McKinsey & Company in 2019, nearly a quarter of participating telecom operators flagged regulation as a key stumbling block for 5G rollouts. High on their lists of concerns: spectrum auctions and rollout obligations (Europe, for example, has taken a relatively slow approach to auctioning the millimetre-wave spectrum deemed necessary for very high data rates). With the advent of 5G rollouts around the world, there is an urgent need to strengthen laws related to the testing of new 5G use cases, to closely assess potential social impacts including those related to inclusion and equal access, to bolster related consumer and personal data protection, and to clarify rules for cross-border data monetization and taxation. The use of 5G for things like autonomous mobility, and flying drones in particular, will require dealings with national authorities like federal ministries on matters like air traffic control and road safety department, and with international agencies like the International Telecommunication Union on issues like harmonizing frequencies. The commercial introduction of autonomous vehicles will require timely software upgrades, for example, to ensure error-free operations in tandem with changing infrastructure in any given location. National regulators and policy-makers have a critical role to play in fostering potential 5G-related benefits for their economies, by focusing on the prompt and adequate spectrum allocation for testbeds, the proper incentives for investing in strong networks, and the crafting of helpful data and monetization policies.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.1"
"4.740","The Return on 5G Investment","","5G has the potential to contribute some $2.2 trillion to the global economy in the next decade and a half, with the bulk of that registering in the manufacturing & utilities and professional & financial services sectors, according to GSMA (a trade organization for mobile operators). However, 5G rollouts will require intensive capital investment reaching as high as $1 trillion worldwide by 2025. The practical impact of 5G has to be enormously significant in order to justify the building of ubiquitous and high-performing 5G network infrastructure (including base stations, mobile backhaul that connects different parts of a network, cloud-computing resources, the core networks themselves, and “end devices” that can include anything from phones and tablets to internet-connected cars). Key challenges for the further development of 5G infrastructure include the limited capacity and availability of fibre backhaul, the cost of deploying fibre across long distances, tapping new funding models for this deployment (and new ownership models), obtaining local permits, and dealing with the fallout of studies on the health impacts of 5G - in Switzerland, for example, the government has sought to assuage public concerns about the health impact of 5G emissions. National authorities can limit the ability of cities to regulate local 5G infrastructure, establish tight deadlines for the approval of equipment installation, or cap the fees for rights of way to access areas to build infrastructure. In terms of hardware, the range of potential 5G devices goes well beyond the smartphones, tablets and modems that underpinned previous generations of mobile networks. 5G devices will not only need to support higher performance levels, but will also have to come in a wider variety of form factors to support different uses - such as the “massive machine-type communication” necessary to power the Internet of Things. One approach designed to ensure maximum return on investment is infrastructure sharing. For example, South Korea’s mobile operators have implemented the sharing of 5G infrastructure, in the interest of saving hundreds of millions of dollars in capital expenditures, accelerating rollouts, and incentivizing the involvement of more industries. However, infrastructure sharing is not the preferred solution in everywhere; for many players, a first-mover advantage is seen as necessary to ensure a sufficient return on investment.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.1"
"4.741","The Risk of Mismatching Risk","","Attracting more private capital to projects via public-private partnerships is one of the most heavily-promoted means of closing an infrastructure funding gap that is expected to grow from $500 billion annually in 2020 to $800 billion annually by 2040, according to the Global Infrastructure Outlook, a tool developed by the Global Infrastructure Hub and Oxford Economics. However, many investors are wary of committing to projects due to what they see as mismatched risk sharing. In Asia, more than 400 million people are still living without electricity, and about 1.5 billion go without basic sanitation, according to a report published in early 2019 by the Asian Development Bank and the Korea Development Institute. And while providing minimum revenue guarantees had been an effective way to draw private sector partners to related infrastructure projects in South Korea, those guarantees created a heavy fiscal burden for the government. As a result, the guarantees were dropped for public-private partnerships in that country in 2009 (albeit while leaving in place existing guarantees worth about $3 billion), according to the report. Even in countries in Southeast Asia energetically promoting public-private partnerships for building infrastructure, like the Philippines, the pace has been sluggish due in part to a lack of public-sector capacity for assessing risk sharing and incentives, according to the Asian Development Bank and Korea Development Institute report. The need for proper risk allocation has become increasingly important, in light of the increased scrutiny placed on public-private partnerships due to high-profile failures that have soured public opinion in some countries. The Asian Development Bank and Korea Development Institute report analysed 41 public-private partnerships in the information and communication technology sector in “developing Asia” between 1991 and 2015, for example, and found that one quarter had been cancelled. While the sources of project failures often extend beyond just risk allocation, spreading risk exposure correctly is crucial. Both the public and private sector tend to believe risk allocation is slanted in the other party’s favour, and so building trust and encouraging transparency could go a long way towards better implementing risk-sharing arrangements.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.79"
"4.742","The Silver Economy","","As the global population grows older and lives longer, it presents inevitable challenges. However, there is an opportunity for the older population to serve as an economic asset, by fostering the so-called silver economy. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s definition, the silver economy is an environment in which people over 60 thrive at work, start innovative companies, are active consumers, and lead active and productive lives. Extending working lives and promoting senior entrepreneurship are increasingly perceived as economic drivers, and both can enable older people to better leverage their institutional knowledge, wisdom, and insights about their peers. In sectors including healthcare, financial services, retail, travel, and entertainment, jobs done by older people that cater to other older people can help capture massive, untapped spending power. An expert consultation organized by the OECD and the Global Coalition on Aging (GCOA) in 2014 concluded that the achievement of a silver economy is not inevitable, however. The private sector will need to create age-neutral workplaces, and life-long learning opportunities, according to the World Economic Forum’s former Global Agenda Council on Ageing’s Guiding Principles for Age-Friendly Businesses. According to the GCOA report Revitalizing Sustainable Growth in Emerging Markets: Insights on Leveraging an Ageing Population, age-friendly businesses recognize that an older workforce is not necessarily less productive, or less valuable. The right policies and programs can enable older employees to drive growth; the auto maker BMW and pharmacy chain CVS, for example, have adapted their work environments in order to better deploy their ageing workforces, and improve efficiency and customer relations. Public policies can also contribute, by incentivizing senior workers. Singapore, for example, enacted the Retirement and Re-Employment Act in 2012, which requires employers to offer re-employment to eligible employees for the first few years after they reach the national retirement age of 62. The GCOA report suggests that governments should use tax incentives, pension flexibility, strong intellectual property rights, and microfinancing vehicles in order to encourage senior social engagement, which can in turn reduce costs associated with unhealthy ageing. While public policies will be pivotal for addressing demographic changes, their success is contingent upon combating prejudices about ageing and life expectancy; as perceptions are changed, alongside policies regarding older employees and consumers, the silver economy opportunity can drive productivity and job creation.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.7"
"4.743","The Social Cost of Carbon","","The cost of carbon-intensive goods like fossil fuel-based energy should reflect the damage they cause. Even a small charge on the emission of carbon dioxide can help insure against climate risk, while providing incentives for the use of (and investment in) clean energy. Economists have identified two forms of carbon pricing as particularly flexible and efficient: emissions trading schemes (or “carbon markets”), and carbon fees or taxes, usually with proceeds that are refunded to the public. The number of related initiatives around the world has doubled during the past decade. According to the Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition, 70 national and sub-national jurisdictions are now pricing about 20% of global emissions. Barriers to taxing carbon at the consumer level, however, remain. In late 2018, France suspended a planned tax hike on gasoline and diesel fuel following violent demonstrations. At about the same time, voters in the state of Washington, one of the most progressive in the US, rejected a proposal to tax carbon dioxide emissions. Clearly, new approaches are needed to gain public support. Pricing carbon is necessary, not just for sound public policy but also for attracting private investment to renewable energy. The High-Level Commission on Carbon Prices, launched in 2016 with support from the World Bank, engages economists and climate change and energy experts in designing effective carbon pricing (a private-sector initiative led by CDP and the We Mean Business Coalition complements this effort). Institutional investors are now paying more attention to carbon risk management, and pushing companies to set an internal price on carbon, assess their exposure to climate-based risks, and allocate capital tailored to a low-carbon economy. A taskforce mandated by the Financial Stability Board has meanwhile published voluntary standards for climate-related financial disclosure, and nearly 1,400 companies reported last year on their practices and plans for pricing carbon. The standards are supported by nearly 300 financial services firms managing about $100 trillion in assets. The Financial Stability Board’s efforts go hand-in-hand with a G20 initiative to reform fossil-fuel subsidies that can lead to wasteful energy consumption. During the past forty years, our understanding of the economic forces underlying climate change has advanced considerably. In recognition of this, the 2018 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was awarded to Yale economist William Nordhaus - for his work integrating climate change and carbon pricing into macroeconomic analysis.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.34"
"4.744","The Trump Presidency","","The election of Donald Trump on a platform of ""America First"" reflected a US electorate splintered along class and racial lines, and wrestling with disruptive forces brought about by globalization and the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The election result came as voters rejected traditional candidates and embraced outsiders likely to disrupt the status quo. It has heated up the national debate on immigration, due in no small part to Trump’s stated plans to build a wall along the US-Mexico border (conflict over construction of the wall triggered a government shutdown in late 2018), and stirred anxieties about the treatment of minorities and women. Trump’s presidency has reshaped and aggravated an already highly polarized political climate. The midterm congressional elections in 2018 reflected this polarized climate, as Democrats won control of the House of Representatives while Republicans strengthened their control of the Senate. The shift in House control portended a combative period, in which Trump is now faced with new congressional investigations and challenges to his domestic and foreign policies.   Factors that led to the current political polarization include large pockets of unemployment, as blue collar jobs have been sent overseas or replaced by new technologies. Meanwhile the nature of work itself has changed, as much higher premiums are now placed on knowledge and technology know-how. These changes have contributed to increased income inequality. According to data published by Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, while real GDP per capita in the US rose sharply between late 2009 (following the Great Recession) and mid-2018, real compensation per hour in the country remained stagnant during the same period. The erosion of trust between the electorate and traditional political leaders is by no means unique to the US. A similar trend is evident around the world, brought about in part by a ubiquitous and constant flow of information - and misinformation. The fact that policy positions which until recently would have been unimaginable are now a part of mainstream political debate means that the US, and the world, may be poised for dramatic change.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.130"
"4.745","The Value of Content","","As access to digital platforms expands, media companies are striving to develop sustainable ways to create and monetize content - in order to be able to continue to invest in its quality. Both traditional and emerging media companies are exploring new business models (such as monetizing data through analytics), generating new funding sources (like crowdfunding, or advertiser-sponsored content), streamlining the process for projects like bringing a TV series to market, and diversifying into other sectors like education. Some publications have sought to eschew advertising entirely; examples include The Information, a technology industry-focused publication founded in 2013 that charges subscribers $39 per month for access, and De Correspondent, a Dutch startup that has relied on both crowdfunding and subscriptions. Both publications focus on in-depth coverage, rather than the daily news cycle, and both are focused on the concept of membership. The Information, for example, offers subscription plans that include an ability to sit in on conference calls, join a private Facebook group, and access invitation-only meetings and events. Increasingly, media organizations are developing advertising campaigns based on sponsored content - a type of “native advertising” that looks like ordinary content but is paid for and presented by an advertiser (and is marked as such). In the US, spending on native digital display advertising was projected to rise to $41.4 billion in 2019 from $16.7 billion in 2016, according to data published by eMarketer. Over that same period of time, the percentage of all display ad spending dedicated to native advertising will grow to 61.4% from less than half, according to the data. Because of its potential to be mistaken for unbiased content, native advertising has received close scrutiny. According to a US Federal Trade Commission report published in late 2017, even after efforts to improve disclosure of native ads that the FTC used in a study, a significant percentage of participants still did not recognize ads as ads. It is not only media organizations that are finding new ways to monetize content. The size of the “influencer marketing” industry, where people with large audiences on sites like Instagram earn sponsorship money for posts, is expected to grow to $8 billion in value on Instagram alone by 2020, from about $4 billion in 2017, according to influencer marketing software firm InfluencerDB.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.94"
"4.746","The ‘Customer’ Knows Best","","The noble foreign aid worker dishing out sacks of food to dazed survivors is a tired stereotype. Humanitarian givers have long had power over receivers, creating a system ripe for abuse and a lack of accountability. Now, thanks in part to models borrowed from the private sector, and to higher expectations from donors, aid recipients (the term “beneficiaries” has been relegated to the dustbin) are getting more say over how humanitarian response functions. In Jordan, for example, a UN-backed call centre handles 150,000 calls a month from refugees with complaints, questions, or requests for advice. The modest improvements long familiar to conventional customer service are gaining ground in humanitarian work, including simple suggestion boxes, self-service apps, and satisfaction surveys. Some donors require that their grantees be independently audited against humanitarian accountability benchmarks. One result: according to a survey published by aid quality analysts ALNAP in 2018, 36% of humanitarian aid recipients were able to express their opinions on programmes, make complaints, or suggest changes to aid agencies - up from just 19% in 2015. Major aid organizations gathered at the World Humanitarian Summit in 2016 pledged that a “participation revolution” would mean affected people and communities are increasingly included in the process of designing programmes meant to help them. The general aim is to make improvements based on their feedback, and to handle their complaints - including those regarding abuse by aid workers - effectively. This has taken on particular urgency, after scandals related to sexual abuse and harassment committed by aid workers were revealed by the media in 2018. An environment in which aid recipients get to design services, criticize providers, and expose failures will not happen by itself, though. Donors and agencies still tend to call the shots, and affected people are often only asked what they need, not how they need it delivered. Recipient feedback can take a back seat to other matters in an urgent atmosphere, and checks and balances, in the form of police or pharmaceutical testing, may be weak or in disarray - leading to a regulatory vacuum where the chances for waste, irrelevance, and unintended harm are high. The need for accountability is therefore acute, because beneficiaries don’t benefit from goods and services they don’t really want or need.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.74"
"4.747","Thematic Investment","","In the years following the global financial crisis, structural economic changes such as ultra-low interest rates, global deleveraging (the shedding of debt assets), and technological innovation have changed the ways that institutional investors deploy capital. The speed of that change is only accelerating, and institutional investors are questioning traditional frameworks based on relative performance - which may fail to incorporate the secular trends (long-term trends, such as the growing economic and geopolitical influence of China, for example) shaping the global economy. Institutional investors have therefore started to consider thematic investment, which goes beyond strategic asset allocation to hone in on these longer-term, structural, political, and social shifts. A thematic approach can enable investors to generate unusually high returns by focusing on areas where significant amounts of capital may be required. It also provides a flexible way to validate insights. However, thematic investing demands a relatively significant amount of research. Many investors have avoided thematic investing, because they think it is too complex to put capabilities in place to develop distinctive insights related to trends like a growing global middle class, increased lifespans, and lifestyle changes. Recently, though, more investors are creatively implementing thematic investing, usually as a complement to other models. As they gain a better understanding of particular sector exposures and then invest accordingly, institutions can increase their odds of delivering superior returns, and of helping to address pressing economic and social challenges.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.81"
"4.748","Trade Facilitation","","Importing and exporting goods are each frequently delayed by costly bureaucratic red tape - according to a study published by the World Trade Organization in 2015, related costs can be equivalent to being hit with a tariff equal to 134% of a product’s monetary value in high-income countries, and equal to more than three times its monetary value in developing countries. Trade facilitation has therefore become increasingly important in a world of crisscrossing global and regional value chains, where products cross borders several times during their assembly. First agreed upon at the Ministerial Conference of the WTO held in Bali in 2013, the Trade Facilitation Agreement entered in force in early 2017. The agreement includes provisions for accelerating the movement, release, and clearance of goods at borders, requires WTO members to accept e-payments and electronic versions of certain import and export documents when possible, and requires members to establish a National Committee on Trade Facilitation as a means to coordinate and implement the agreement according to their domestic needs.  Paperless customs, in combination with a centralized “single window” system that collects trade documentation in one place, can reduce inefficiency, delays, and uncertainty at the border. The Trade Facilitation Agreement therefore provides for greater cooperation between national customs and other authorities - and a means for developing-country WTO members to simplify, modernize, and harmonize their import and export processes and procedures. The requirements to implement the agreement are linked to a member’s capacity to do so, and a Trade Facilitation Agreement Facility was established in 2014 to ensure that necessary technical assistance is available. The Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation, a public-private partnership co-led by the World Economic Forum, also supports implementation. The WTO estimates that full implementation could reduce trade costs by an average of 14.3%, and increase global trade by up to $1 trillion per year - with developing countries benefitting most. In Colombia, for example, the National Food and Drug Surveillance Institute was able to reduce physical food inspections by 27% as a result of a GATF project, which translated into a reduction in processing time for low-risk shipments from as much as 24 hours to as little as one hour.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.84"
"4.749","Trade Openness","","Ethiopia’s performance in this area of the Index shows the greatest room for improvement in terms of the severity of tariff rates, where it has a progress score (ranging from a poor mark of zero to a top mark of one hundred) of 8.50, resulting in a rank of 129th out of 140 countries; in terms of the openness of its services sector to trade and competition where it has a progress score of 11.80 that results in a rank of 98th out of 98 countries. One indicator reflects a better performance: the complexity of tariffs, where it has a progress score of 91.70 that results in a rank of 34th out of 140 countries.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","['1.49', '1.53', '1.89', '1.91', '1.126']"
"4.750","Trade and Development","","Roughly 8% of the global population, with the majority in sub-Saharan Africa, is suffering from extreme poverty, according to the Overseas Development Institute. The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (adopted in 2015) recognize the importance of trade as an engine for more inclusive global economic growth. However, annual global trade volume growth is expected to slow to 2.6% in 2019 from 3% in the prior year, according to the World Trade Organization. And the figures for least-developed countries look particularly bleak - their share of global merchandise exports fell to 0.9% in 2016, from 1.1% in 2013, after having risen from 0.6% between 2000 and 2013, according to the 2018 Sustainable Development Goals Report. One encouraging sign has been the creation of the African Continental Free Trade Area in April, 2019, with the goal of fostering intra-African trade by reducing the many impediments in place (the biggest holdout has been Nigeria, however, which boasts Africa’s biggest economy and is home to more than 90 million people living in extreme poverty). The challenges that have mounted for the WTO are therefore worrying for developing countries that could potentially benefit from healthy, open global trade flows guided by the steadying hand of a respected international organization. The US has pursued openly protectionist trade policies, for example by slapping tariffs on billions of dollars-worth of goods not only from China but also from traditional allies such as Canada - potentially encouraging other world powers to follow suit (in addition, the US has blocked the appointment of WTO Appellate Body members, rendering this dispute settlement mechanism dysfunctional). In this context, a joint statement published by a diverse group of developing countries (from China to Uganda) declared the “pre-eminence of the WTO as the global forum for trade rules setting and governance” in 2019. This group’s view that Special and Differential Treatment provisions for developing-country WTO members must be preserved and strengthened is another area where its positions stand in stark contrast to those of the US and many other Western nations - though there may be room for related compromise, at least regarding the biggest economies that are still within the developing-country designation.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.84"
"4.751","Trade and Integration","","Since the early 1990s, Chile has committed to an increasing openness to trade, a relatively flexible currency policy, and a robust regulatory framework designed to manage foreign investment flows that first sprouted in the mid-1970s. Chile boasts a comprehensive set of bilateral trade agreements; according to the General Directorate of International Economic Relations (DIRECON), the country has signed trade agreements with 64 different partners that combined represent 86.3% of global GDP. Chile also actively participates in multilateral platforms, including the Latin-American Integration Association (ALADI) and the Pacific Alliance - an organization that the country helped to found. Chile’s open approach to international markets has supported the country’s sustained economic growth for last three decades. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) 2015 report Diagnostic on Engagement in Global Value Chains, Chile benefitted from low import tariffs and preferential trading agreements, and ranked among the best economic performers in its region. The World Economic Forum’s Enabling Trade Index 2016 ranked Chile above other OECD economies including the US, Australia, Canada and the Republic of Korea, particularly in terms of foreign market access. Still, the country is primarily a producer of basic commodities, and is particularly dependent on copper. Early success in this market, combined with the commodities price boom of the late 2000s, prevented Chile from pursuing a broader variety of exports. Diversifying Chile’s export structure, and boosting the participation of Chilean firms in more innovative value chains, will be a challenge. The Enabling Trade Index 2016 listed challenges that Chile needs to address related to infrastructure, transport services, and the use of information and communications technology. In addition, the Forum's Executive Opinion Survey 2016 identified problematic factors for the country’s exports including tariff barriers, relatively high costs and delays caused by international transportation, and access to trade finance. The OECD has recommended that Chile expand research and development spending and promotion, and export the country’s copper-related products and technology.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.29"
"4.752","Trade and Investment","","International trade and global supply chains are at the heart of the electronics industry, which sources components around the globe and divvies up production steps in many different countries. Industry leaders must work together with governments and other players to reduce trade barriers, and increase efficiencies. Fostering greater global trade can ignite job growth, create efficient and competitive markets, and put the global economy on the path of stable growth. While simply lowering tariffs can stimulate trade, that pales in comparison to the economic growth that can be created when supply chain-related limitations are reduced, or eliminated. One political complication, however, is that much of the electronics industry is concentrated in Asia; in addition, unstable or poorly functioning governments, and uncertain regulatory environments, can result in trade barriers. Another complication is the importance that national security agencies place on information and communication systems, which can influence and hinder commercial trading relationships. The World Trade Organization’s 2016 World Trade Report noted that innovation is increasingly advanced at export-oriented firms in emerging and developing markets. Shifts like this in the global trade landscape will impact traditional trading routes, influence national interests, and affect product development. As new markets arise, the electronics industry will have to adapt and adjust their supply chains, and better differentiate products for new customers. The US has managed to transform the North America Free Trade Association (NAFTA) into the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), and its trade dispute with the European Union appears to have been resolved. But the US’s trade dispute with China continues to intensify, amid disagreement over the size of current account deficits, steel and aluminium prices, and the alleged theft of intellectual property by Chinese companies (the US has lodged a related complaint with the World Trade Organization against China contesting its potential “market economy status,” a designation that would protect Chinese goods from anti-dumping duties). As it has made good on tariff threats with both traditional allies and adversaries alike, the Trump administration has cited a need to protect domestic manufacturing and fulfil campaign promises. When addressing the international business community at the World Economic Forum’s Annual Meeting in Davos in 2018, President Trump said his “America First” policy does not mean America alone. However, the US has demonstrated scepticism about multilateral agreements generally, and pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which had to be reformulated without the US in 2018 as the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership. The original TPP had been an economic pillar of the Obama administration. China is advancing its own regional goals with its massive Belt and Road Initiative, which involves more than $900 billion in infrastructure projects in various parts of the world that are either planned or underway. In 2017, Chinese President Xi Xinping announced a joint China-Russia development fund, reportedly in part to assuage Russian concerns that the initiative may encroach on Russian spheres of influence. The Chinese leadership has also signalled interest in a Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership that includes the ten Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) members, in addition to Australia, India, and Japan. Meanwhile in Europe French President Emmanuel Macron has called for the better protection of strategic trade interests; both France and Germany are wary of Chinese investment in their domestic transport, defence, technology, and engineering sectors. Some countries have made loans to other countries that create ties which can later be leveraged as needed, in order to advance political priorities or gain strategic footholds. For example, after Sri Lanka was unable to repay a reported $8 billion loan to Chinese state-owned enterprises, China was allowed to sign a 99-year lease to occupy Sri Lanka’s strategic port of Hambantota.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","['1.45', '1.64']"
"4.753","Trade and Taxation","","The growing importance of the digital economy has raised questions about the best ways to tax companies that generate their revenue online. Making related changes, however, can have broad implications for global geopolitics and economic growth. Predominantly internet-based businesses - particularly those big enough to attract a global user base - have drawn criticism for the ways in which they are perceived to avoid taxes. In Europe, for example, some governments have pressed for taxation of the largest internet firms, such as Google and Facebook, based on the revenue they make in a particular location, rather than based on the profit they recognize in relatively low-tax jurisdictions such as Ireland. Meanwhile Amazon.com, which long faced pressure from state governments in the US to charge state sales tax on purchases, has begun applying the tax not only to goods the company sells directly, but also to those sold on the site by third parties. While information and communications technology generally drives productivity growth in both the developed and developing worlds, many countries discourage adoption by imposing discriminatory tariffs and taxes on things like mobile phones, computers, and telecommunications services - which is done simply in order to increase government revenue, or protect domestic companies. Niger, for example, which has one of the lowest mobile broadband adoption rates in Africa, also has taxes on mobile broadband that are equal to 23% of average per capita income, according to a 2017 report published by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. By way of comparison, a number of countries including India, Brazil, Mexico, and Turkey all have taxes on mobile broadband that amount to significantly less than 5% of average income, according to data published in 2016 by GSMA, the industry group that represents mobile operators.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.85"
"4.754","Trade and Travel Barriers to Mobility","","Most mobility-related infrastructure, bureaucracy, and thinking is decidedly dated. Lingering barriers to mobility include the use of trade tariffs - the US-China trade war, for example, has resulted in a series of tariffs that have made parts more expensive for American manufacturers and thereby made it more difficult for them to remain competitive - and onerous visa requirements for travelers. Free trade agreements and an expansion of goods and services moving across borders can have profound economic benefits. However, recent casualties in world of free trade deals include the stalled Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), which would have created a free-trade area between the US and the European Union, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which was expected to become the world’s largest free trade deal before the US withdrew in 2017 (other signatories have since forged ahead). Much must still be done to better align the hundreds of regional trade agreements in force; according to the World Bank’s 2014 Doing Business project, a single export was liable to require up to 11 documents and 86 days of shipping due to red tape. In 2018, international tourist arrivals increased by 6% compared with the prior year, to 1.4 billion, according to a report published by the International Organization for Migration - marking the latest upswing in what has been an explosion in travel and tourism in the last few decades. However, in order to truly help many countries bolster their economic competitiveness, more must be done to make it easier for people to visit them, according to the report, which noted that only 21% of the global population did not require a visa when traveling for tourism purposes in 2018. A number of bilateral and regional agreements have been implemented to reduce travel barriers, including the Schengen Agreement, the US Global Entry program, and the APEC Business Travel Card. New technology and digitization can also help make travel a more seamless experience. However, the private sector must take a proactive role in making the case to governments that travel facilitation through technology can bring economic and security benefits.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.62"
"4.755","Trade and the Environment","","Global trade can contribute to environmental sustainability - if it is well regulated. It has a widely-recognized role to play in promoting food security, ocean health, and sustainable energy, and in combatting climate change (it underpins a number of United Nations Sustainable Development Goals). Positive related impacts can result from reducing subsidies for fisheries and fossil fuels, restricting illegal trade in minerals and protected species, and promoting technology that can be used to take climate action. The World Trade Organization provides the sole global framework for cooperation on phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, which are estimated to cost roughly $600 billion annually (though negotiations on the WTO’s Environmental Goods Agreement, which could increase the accessibility of environmental goods, have stalled). In light of often-slow progress in amending multilateral trade rules, regional trade agreements can provide an important alternative. For example, while the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) has been panned by environmental groups, it includes provisions prohibiting both subsidies for overfished stocks and illegal fishing, as well as binding commitments on implementing environmental agreements. In general, the environmental chapters of regional trade deals like this often go beyond current WTO rules. International trade has created both challenges and opportunities for environmental regulators. While WTO rules allow for environmental measures (if they are based on environmental performance), for example, domestic climate action can run afoul of the international trade regime if it favours local suppliers. At the same time, the environmental border tax adjustment (domestic environmental taxes on imports from countries without such taxes) admissible under WTO rules can help limit the incentive for countries with stringent environmental policies to outsource activity to countries without those policies; research published in 2018, for example, showed that while Britain had cut emissions within its borders, when including emissions tied to its imports the country’s carbon footprint had actually grown. Ultimately, a consumption-based approach that makes the environmental impact of production clear to consumers could not only trace the effects of international trade, it could also provide information that is at least as valuable as that included in labelling campaigns related to child labour, fair trade, and the endangerment of dolphins as a result of fishing. The desire to make this approach a more common reality has intensified efforts to publish reliable environmental footprint indicators.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.84"
"4.756","Training and Certification Systems","","A greater variety of adult training and learning opportunities will be necessary in order to ensure that the 3 billion people in the current global workforce, and their employers, are able to navigate the Fourth Industrial Revolution. People increasingly need to re-skill throughout their working lives, and can benefit from more modular, diversified learning formats. This calls for a paradigm shift away from the current, front-loaded education model to one that assumes a need for continuous re-skilling throughout a lifetime. In addition, all learning needs to involve a contemporary curriculum, which fosters cognitive flexibility, curiosity, creativity, imagination, and a passion for further learning. Most importantly, participation rates need to improve. According to a report published by the European Association for the Education of Adults in 2017, only about 11% of adults in the European Union aged between 25 and 64 were participating in education and training programs as of 2016; the figure was as low as 1.2% for Romania, and as high as nearly 30% in Sweden.   Distributing learning across lifecycles redistributes the responsibilities of stakeholders including individual learners, businesses and professional associations, examining bodies, universities, unions, community learning centres, and governments. Multi-stakeholder collaboration will be critical for ensuring that strategies aimed at re-skilling individuals are balanced and complementary. Because of shifts in skills demand and industry composition, certification should enable workers to validate their skills within a number of industries and across a number of regions. According to a report published by the McKinsey Global Institute in 2018, as much as 14% of the global workforce may need to switch occupational categories by the year 2030, due to increased digitalization, automation, and advances in artificial intelligence. However, related public spending has been slow to materialize (and has actually fallen steadily for years in most Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries), according to the report. Meanwhile a related survey conduction by the Mckinsey Global Institute in 2017 found that about 30% of executives at large companies saw addressing potential skills gaps resulting from digitalization and automation as among their top five priorities.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.135"
"4.757","Transatlantic Relations","","Since the end of World War II, Europe has looked at the world through a transatlantic lens; its relationship with the US has been cherished as its closest, and most important. Though there have been fluctuations in that alliance, it is built on the notion that the partners are fundamentally like-minded, and will always be there for each other in times of crisis. Donald Trump’s presidency could fundamentally reshape this relationship. His view of the European Union is at best ambivalent. At worst, he considers it an enemy in economic warfare. Ted Malloch, once considered a potential US ambassador to the EU under Trump, has compared the EU to the Soviet Union. Trump has made it clear that he will put “America first,” and continues to attack global institutions that the US has helped to build, as he appears to view them as imposing intolerable constraints. Since the end of the Cold War, the world has been held together by American-guaranteed security and European-inspired legal order. But America’s guarantee no longer appears to be reliable. Trump has shown that he has a transactional view of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), for example, by questioning whether the US would defend NATO members if they do not do more to defend themselves.  In May 2018, the US announced it would impose tariffs on steel and aluminium from the EU, and the EU responded in kind with its own tariff announcement - adding yet another complication to transatlantic relations. Europe fears that a Trump administration may actually be kinder to America’s traditional foes. Most challenging for Europeans is Trump’s expressed admiration for Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin. If Trump were to recognize the Russian Federation’s contested 2014 annexation of Crimea, the EU would be placed in a near-impossible position. Traditional communication channels are no longer being used, and fewer personal relationships exist between European governments and the US administration. Meanwhile, deliberations about a sort of European emancipation from the US have become more serious in Paris and Berlin. German Chancellor Angela Merkel made a remarkable speech in a Bavarian beer tent in May 2017, telling the audience - and the world - that Germany had to take its fate into its own hands. Europe will not break with America, but the time when Europeans could rely on a key ally is to some degree over, which should push Europeans toward EU reform.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.50"
"4.758","Transformation and Investment","","The South African economy is one of the most industrialized on the African continent. However, peak manufacturing levels in terms of share of employment were reached in the 1980s - and much of that was achieved due to protectionist policies implemented during the apartheid era. For much of the post-apartheid period, the trend in South Africa has been towards de-industrialization, as manufacturing has declined as a share of employment and added economic value. Manufacturing has become increasingly capital-, skill- and technology-intense, limiting the ability of unskilled labourers to enter the sector. In addition, factors that have hindered the ability of South African firms to compete internationally include the global manufacturing dominance of China. According to a report published by the World Bank in 2018, South Africa’s economic performance is closely tied to commodities that have suffered from declines in demand; coal prices are expected to dip as countries like China switch to greener sources of energy, for example, while China’s shift away from being an investment-driven economy (and towards being consumption-driven) has hurt iron ore prices, and gold prices are seen declining as interest rates are generally poised to increase.      South Africa’s reliance on commodities and commodity-based manufactured products has made it difficult for the country to diversify into other, more complex manufacturing industries. In addition, manufacturing-led structural transformation is not necessarily the only means of driving economic development and employment growth. A project commissioned by the United Nations University World Institute for Development Economics Research, Industries without Smokestacks, argues that service industries can spur employment-intensive growth. Meanwhile advances in robotics, artificial intelligence, sensors, 3D printing, automation, and machine learning, all elements of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, will likely have a significant impact on how goods and services are produced - and on the forms of employment underlying this production. These advances are typically both labour saving and complemented by skilled labour. As such, they are unlikely to positively address the unemployment challenges facing the South African economy, which has a surplus of unskilled labour. According to the World Bank report, prospects for this group have not improved; while skilled employment in the country rose 2.8% in 2017 compared with the prior year, unskilled employment increased by just 1.8%.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.119"
"4.759","Transformation of Biological Threats","","The world is under-prepared for even modest biological threats. We are vulnerable to significant harm to personal  well-being, economic activity, and national security caused by outbreaks of existing or modified strains of pathogens. In the past, naturally emerging infectious diseases have caused extraordinary health-related, economic, and security-related impacts - often fuelled by changing patterns of human behaviour. Many years of global headlines have made some of the biggest threats familiar: Ebola, MERS, SARS, Zika, yellow fever, and each year’s new strain of influenza. The frequency of disease outbreaks has been rising steadily. Between 1980 and 2013, there were 12,012 recorded outbreaks comprised of 44 million individual cases, affecting every country in the world. In June 2018 there were, for the first time ever, outbreaks of six of the eight categories of disease in the World Health Organization’s “priority diseases” list. If any had spread widely, it would have potentially killed thousands and created major global disruption. In addition to naturally occurring risks, emerging technologies are also making it increasingly easy for new biological threats to be manufactured and released - either deliberately or by accident. Driven by scientific advances and market forces, the cost of DNA synthesis has decreased at a rate faster than Moore’s Law; more and more people around the world have access to powerful biotechnologies that were once accessible only to well-established and well-funded scientists. It is possible now for a small research team to conduct experiments with potentially profound global consequences. For example, in 2018 a group of researchers in Canada demonstrated that a budget of $100,000 is enough to synthesize horsepox virus. Horsepox is benign to humans, but a close relative is Variola major, which causes smallpox - a disease that was eradicated in 1980 after having killed 300 million people since 1900. Live samples of smallpox virus now exist in just two highly secure facilities, one in the US and one in Russia. By publishing the synthesis process for horsepox virus, the Canadian research team sharply lowered the barriers to smallpox synthesis, and increased the risk of smallpox being released into the world either accidentally or intentionally. The world is at a critical juncture. If there is one area in which a turn inward by societies could be truly and needlessly destructive, it is global health security. Yet, as new risks emerge, there are early signs that important governance systems and protocols are eroding.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.70"
"4.760","Transforming Africa","","At the end of the Cold War, only three African countries were widely considered legitimate electoral democracies: Botswana, Gambia and Mauritius. Now, according to a 2018 report published by the non-governmental organization Freedom House, 61% of the countries in sub-Saharan Africa are rated as either “free” or “partly free” democracies. Highlights from the region flagged in the report included the exit of former president of Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe, and the dismantling of the family-based power structure in Angola set up by former President Jose Edward dos Santos. While the period between independence from colonial rule in Africa and the end of the Cold War had not seen a single ruler peacefully removed at the ballot box (with the exception of Mauritius), in 2016 there were 12 different presidential elections held during the year. Coupled with advances in health, education and technology, this has helped to generate a new narrative for Africa. According to UNESCO, secondary-school enrolment in the continent rose from 25% of eligible children in 1999 to 41% by 2012, as education programs were expanded and school fees were scrapped. Between 2010 and 2015, according to the World Health Organization, expanded intervention helped reduce malaria incidences by 21%, and malaria mortality rates by 31%. Average annual GDP growth for African countries is expected to reach 3.5% in 2019, according to the World Bank. A consumer explosion driven by the internet and mobile phone use has empowered Africans; Sub-Saharan Africa is home to the fastest mobile phone penetration growth of any region in the world, according to the GSMA, and its 420 million mobile subscribers is expected to grow to more than a half a billion by 2020. However, there is an urgent need to speed up the rate of structural transformation across the continent. Most African economies are still dependent on exports of primary commodities, while the share of manufacturing in national output is less than 10% on average - and is declining in some cases. There is therefore a need to better diversify African economies, with an initial focus on processing of agricultural commodities and minerals. This could kickstart a process of local industrialization, create more jobs in rural areas, and help stem rural-to-urban migration.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.6"
"4.761","Transforming Governance and Institutions","","The relative lack of transparency and high levels of corruption in many countries in the Middle East and North Africa region are obstacles to economic development. Corruption generates significant systemic, economic repercussions; the annual cost of bribery, for example (just one subset of corruption) is estimated to be as much as $2 trillion, or equivalent to about 2% of global GDP, according to a speech delivered by International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde in 2017. A lack of transparency and trust in government, financial institutions, and businesses can undermine development and deter investment. Meanwhile violence and armed conflict can compound this phenomenon, by facilitating illicit trade flows. According to the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index published in 2018, corruption remains endemic in the MENA region, which is stricken by dictatorships and violent conflict; 19 of 21 Arab states scored below 50 in the index, where zero is highly corrupt and 100 is very clean. A key challenge for governments in the region is to tackle public sector corruption, in particular - and to ensure the separation of, and independence of, the executive and legislative branches. The participation of countries including Tunisia, Morocco, and Jordan in the Open Government Partnership, a platform designed to help reformers make their governments more open and accountable, is a promising sign. Public-sector corruption can only be checked by a mobilized public, and social media can have an important related impact - by empowering citizens and informing them of their rights, and keeping them abreast of government proceedings. Because of the relative youth of the population in the Arab world, the pace and depth of the integration of digital platforms within public service broadcasting in the region - as well as the speed of development of electronic, mobile, and smart government initiatives - can prove to be key for advancing transparency. Governments themselves can meanwhile use these tools to more directly engage with constituents, and become more accessible. In the United Arab Emirates, for example, the introduction of e-governance has been part of an effort to increase transparency; it has also motivated several other Gulf Cooperation Council countries (a group that includes Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia) to launch their own, similar programs.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.97"

"4.763","Transition to a Low-Carbon Economy","","While fossil fuels like coal have helped to improve living standards around the world since the 18th century, associated greenhouse gas emissions have led to devastating global warming. In order to avoid reaching temperatures that would have catastrophic consequences for the planet, countries must decarbonize their energy systems by the middle of this century. Companies with coal mines and reserves therefore face a significant risk of stranded assets. However, for minerals considered critical for the green transition - those needed for renewable power plants, energy storage solutions, efficient housing and infrastructure, or related technology and transportation systems - increased demand is likely. With this opportunity comes a series of risks. For example, as final products based on these in-demand minerals become more modular, they will potentially become easier to recycle if the right incentives are in place. While vertically-integrated mining companies (active along the entire ""value chain"" from mining minerals to selling finished products) in the steel and aluminium sectors are already an important part of recycling systems, a thriving recycling sector might ultimately dampen any demand for minerals generated by the clean energy transition. Transitioning to a low carbon economy will require the mining sector to reduce its environmental footprint. This is especially true now, because energy and water demand related to mining are expected to increase due to declining ore grades (as more energy is needed to produce the minerals that are in demand). Mining, processing, smelting, and transportation are energy intensive, and largely fossil fuel based. Mining companies are increasingly sourcing renewable energy in order to decarbonize; electrifying their operations and investing in alternative fuels to power their equipment will be key for them. Ultimately, companies with low-emission and recycling operations can market themselves at a premium to consumers and corporations increasingly conscious of greenhouse gas emissions. Public procurement programs in OECD countries that promote greener purchasing are evidence of this, as are commitments from companies to rely solely on recycled metals and minerals. Apple, for example, outlined plans in a 2017 report to help reduce the need to mine metals from the earth by only making use of renewable resources or recycled material. The company cited related developments including an ability to melt down iPhone 6 aluminium enclosures to make Mac mini computers for use in its factories.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.99"
"4.764","Transitioning to Clean Energy","","Renewable energy accounted for about 9.5% of all global energy in 2017, a slight increase compared with the prior year, according to the 2018 World Energy Outlook published by the International Energy Agency. The renewables counted in this mix included solar, wind, geothermal, and modern biomass energy, along with traditional hydroelectric power. More importantly, however, are projections for renewables to increase electrical power as a way to decarbonize the world’s energy supply. Thanks to economies of scale, and technologies like efficient solar cells and larger wind turbines, these energy sources now compete with fossil fuels. An analysis by the investment bank Lazard shows that during the past decade the “levelized” cost of electricity from wind farms (its average cost over the farm's lifetime) has decreased by two-thirds, and from utility-scale solar farms by nearly 90%. In many places, wind and solar are now cheaper than coal and natural gas. The emergence of new renewable energy markets has meanwhile reduced operating costs. In developing countries, renewable energy mini-grids are electrifying communities, while in developed countries solar power is reducing reliance on the grid, bolstered by renewable energy credits and tax incentives. Decarbonizing transportation poses the biggest challenge. The United Kingdom, France and China are among the countries that have announced their intention to curb fossil-fuel cars or entirely phase out internal combustion engines, and the number of electric vehicles on the road is projected to increase by more than 7,000% between 2017 and 2030. Still, this will be less than 15% of the nearly 2 billion vehicles expected to be in operation by then. Aviation and shipping are on track to account for nearly 40% of carbon-dioxide emissions by 2050. A report published by the Energy Transitions Commission outlined a plan to cut emissions with smarter logistics that improve efficiency by tempering demand for carbon-intensive transport. The high cost of energy storage in batteries is the main barrier preventing widespread adoption of intermittent renewable energy; a massive improvement in energy density is needed for lithium-ion batteries to compete with liquid fuels. Just as important as scaling-up battery technology will be the cleaning up of entire product chains, from working conditions in the mines that supply raw materials for batteries, to the pollution associated with the improper disposal of batteries. The World Economic Forum’s Global Battery Alliance was created in 2017 to address these challenges.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.34"
"4.765","Transnational Actors","","International relations is not only about relations between nations. While sovereign countries remain central actors on the world’s political stage, a host of non-state and transnational actors have inserted themselves into discussions about global governance. Digitalization has reduced communication costs such that businesses, for example, can more easily organize themselves globally and adopt global issues and concerns, while even relatively small civil society groups can connect across borders in order to tackle issues with an international scope. It has become increasingly clear that problems like the negative effects of climate change, heavy flows of migration as refugees flee from armed conflict and economic hardship, a lack of adequate health care in less developed regions, and the depletion of natural resources cannot be adequately addressed within national borders - giving actors previously concerned only with local issues a greater incentive to engage with global governance. These transnational actors include corporations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), city governments, philanthropic organizations, and trade associations. Some have become extraordinarily influential, such as the Gates Foundation, thanks to its work on solving global health problems, or the C40 network of cities, due to its work related to addressing climate change. Meanwhile multinational corporations often boast annual revenue that is larger than the size of many countries’ GDPs, and large NGOs often have more delegates at international meetings than some medium-sized nations. As the capability of these actors sometimes outweighs that of nation states, it lends them decisive roles in resolving global issues. Their contributions do not necessarily come at the expense of government influence, but they have fundamentally reshaped notions about who matters in world politics. Increasingly, though, transnational actors also include dangerous entities like organized crime syndicates, terrorist networks and paramilitary organizations. Such organizations have benefited from financial globalization and digitalization, and have developed sophisticated communications strategies and clandestine, cross-border networks that can be difficult to track and confront. Particularly in those parts of the world with fragile or corrupt state organizations, these transnational entities can exploit weak governance and evade law enforcement.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.68"

"4.767","Transparency and Open Government","","Transparency is essential to hold governments accountable. But a new consensus is emerging that transparency alone is insufficient; without careful contextual considerations, it can lead to unanticipated outcomes. Improving transparency appears to be most effective in societies where corruption is fairly rare to begin with. In places where corruption is systemic, where citizens believe it is impossible to operate in government without becoming embroiled in corruption, transparency may actually engender resignation. In such contexts, greater openness is only more likely to lead to desired changes if accompanied by efforts to encourage citizen participation and alter beliefs about the inevitability of corruption. There have been improvements in terms of laws that promote transparency; the World Trade Organization’s 2013 Bali Package requires customs procedures to be more open, while membership in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative has grown (according to a 2017 paper published in the Journal of Development Studies, the initiative appears to have shielded participating countries from increased corruption). In addition, as of 2015 about 90 countries had adopted Freedom of Information laws. A study published in 2017 found that while these laws normally increase the level of perceived government corruption immediately after they are introduced, the longer they are retained the more likely perceived corruption is to decline. In order for transparency initiatives to contribute to greater accountability, information needs to be regularly updated and easy to locate. One example is the establishment of so-called Transparency Portals by the Brazilian government, which empower citizens to find data about government salaries and spending. Seoul’s OPEN system (the Seoul Metropolitan Government’s Online Procedures Enhancement for civil applications) has facilitated citizen complaints about fees being charged illegally by government officials. Armed with information, citizens can monitor gaps in the delivery of goods and services that may indicate corruption. In Uganda, data on monthly school transfers of central government education grants were published in local newspapers, empowering parents and teachers to check if their local school had received the funds it was due. This led to a reduction in money lost to local government corruption, and to higher enrolment and test scores at schools in areas with high newspaper penetration. In addition, raising public familiarity with policy-making through “participatory budgeting” has been shown, in some instances, to reduce corruption, as citizens become better placed to ask questions and exert pressure if the goods and services they are anticipating fail to appear.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.37"
"4.768","Transparency-Enabling Technologies","","Innovative technology solutions can bolster anti-corruption efforts and policies, by enabling transparency when it comes to decision-making processes, financial flows, and ownership records. Transparency and accountability rely on processes in order to be effective, while these processes increasingly rely on technology. In the same way that mobile phone technology and the wireless internet have allowed many people in developing countries to leapfrog decades of legacy infrastructure investment made by more developed peers, technology developments related to artificial intelligence, blockchain, digital identity, and the use of big data now have the potential to limit opportunities for many kinds of corruption. Examples of successfully relying on technology to address corruption have proliferated. They include e-governance platforms that enable citizens to access information about the awarding of public contracts, automated decision making that can reduce the potential for conflicts of interest and bribery, artificial intelligence that can quickly scan transactions and develop patterns to identify money laundering schemes, and blockchain technology that can be used to meticulously track the transfer of funds using a dispersed ledger that cannot be surreptitiously altered. Particularly in situations where administrative and bureaucratic infrastructures are insufficient to enforce anti-corruption rules, a greater use of technology can help make significant progress. For example, in India, since 2010, the website ipaidabribe.com has empowered citizens to anonymously detail bribes paid to government officials, including the name of the official, the amount paid, and the service for which it was paid. Even though the site has some shortcomings, there is evidence that it has helped people to avoid having to pay bribes - by enabling them to choose to register their land transactions at offices where relatively few requested bribes have been disclosed. To be sure, technology also has the potential to be misused, in order to facilitate corruption. Technology-supported decision-making processes can also create opacity, by adding complexity or by limiting the number of individuals who are genuinely able to understand how to track the flow of transactions and funds. In addition, all systems and processes that rely on connected technologies can be exposed to hacking and other cyber threats.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.37"
"4.769","Travel and Trade Barriers","","The infrastructure and daunting bureaucracy that 21st century travellers must navigate are decidedly 20th century in nature. Inefficiencies are particularly apparent when seeking to obtain a visa, or navigating an airport. Still, some progress has been made. According to the World Tourism Organization, as of 2016, 58% of the world’s population was required to obtain a traditional visa prior to departure to a foreign destination, a decline compared with 77% in 2008. Travel barriers impede growth and depress job creation. A study published in the Journal of Economics and Finance in 2016 estimated that removing travel visas at the bilateral level between countries could more than triple cross-border travel flows. Meanwhile the World Tourism Organization and World Travel & Tourism Council have estimated that improving visa processes could generate an additional $206 billion in tourism receipts, and 5.1 million jobs over the course of a few years in G20 economies. Solutions implemented to support the reduction of travel barriers include the Schengen agreement, which facilitates movement across the borders of 26 countries in Europe, and the APEC Business Travel Card, which eliminates the need for business travellers from more than a dozen countries in different regions of the world to obtain visas. Other regional agreements are in the process of being negotiated or implemented, including potentially visa-free travel within the Association of Southeast Nations (ASEAN), and possible single passports for the Pacific Alliance (Colombia, Chile, Mexico and Peru) and Africa. A comprehensive model for revamping visa and border processes could revolutionize the travel and tourism sector in the same way that the smartphone has transformed telecommunications and media. The same technologies that enable travellers to book flights and keep their boarding passes on their phones should be applied to enhance border security and travel facilitation, in the form of e-visas and trusted traveller (expedited travel for the pre-approved) programs.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.16"
"4.770","Trust Deficit","","Since the 2008 global financial crisis, the financial industry, including hedge funds and private equity firms, has been the focus of public anger and distrust around the globe. According to the 2016 Edelman Trust Barometer, the financial services industry is globally perceived as the least trustworthy of the 8 industry sectors measured, scoring only 51% on trustworthiness. The 2014 version of same survey found that financial advisory and asset management was the least trustworthy sector within financial services, scoring 46% on trustworthiness. Furthermore, the Edelman surveys of the past few years have found that distrust of financial service institutions is concentrated in the United States and Western Europe, home to developed economies that serve as headquarters to most large financial institutions. A major cause of this trust deficit can be traced back to the bank bailouts after the 2008 crisis, an increase in income inequality and the current political environment. The general public is also weary of the perceived secretive nature of financial institutions, with client information, assets under management and investment strategies often kept strictly confidential. Governance of financial institutions, both within firms and by authorities, is often opaque with different levels of required disclosure depending on size and with very little information required to be shared publicly. This trust deficit partially affects the ability of private investors to attract capital as public sentiment makes big public institutional investments in alternatives, particularly hedge funds, a political liability. A lack of public trust also increases the likelihood of heightened government oversight and more transparency requirements that many private investors argue would endanger their ability to execute their proprietary investment strategies. Finally, the public’s anger has led to a focus on the fee structure of alternative investment firms with carried interest for private equity and the ‘two and twenty’ model employed by hedge funds – wherein hedge fund managers charge 2% of assets managed and claim 20% of any profits - being singled out by both liberal and conservative politicians.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.110"
"4.771","Trust and Accountability","","Tools and platforms like Facebook and Twitter have demonstrated the power of individuals to inform and educate in a shifting media landscape. They have also showcased the pitfalls of enabling that ability. More than half of the respondents surveyed in nearly 40 countries for a report published by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism and the University of Oxford in 2018 said they were concerned about what is real and fake on the internet - with the highest percentage registered in Brazil (85%) and the lowest in the Netherlands (30%). The report also recorded the first decline in the use of social media for news after years of continuous growth - almost entirely due to a decline in the posting and sharing of news on Facebook. Journalists have a particular responsibility to adapt to this new era of communication, not least because their work is at risk of being drowned out by cacophony, and they themselves are at risk of being manipulated into spreading disinformation, according to a report published by UNESCO in 2018; journalism must distance itself from information that might interest the public, but is not in the public interest. As individuals increasingly participate in content creation and distribution, it raises questions about that content’s validity, and about who is accountable for its accuracy. Journalists are already grappling with how to regain public trust, due to a lack of transparency in the news gathering process. The increasing prevalence of artificial Intelligence and machine learning in the technology industry will only further complicate the matter. A team at OpenAI, a research institute in the US, has developed a program that can generate realistic news stories by feeding it an initial concept, for example. However, OpenAI’s policy director told MIT Technology Review in early 2019 that OpenAI quickly realized that the program was vulnerable to abuse; it could be used to quickly churn out fake news stories (targeted to people based on their online profiles) that would be so prevalent they would be difficult to tune out. The issue of accountability for publishing such material has stirred heated debate. Twitter, for example, has made some efforts to rid itself of bots (and real people) spewing misinformation - though Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey is still regularly asked why he does not ban certain accounts or behaviour. Dorsey testified to Congress in 2018 that he is committed to ensuring that “all voices can be heard.”","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.94"
"4.772","Trust and Privacy","","Global dialogue around the governing and safeguarding of personal data is polarized. The often conflicting objectives of governments, businesses and private citizens result in a complicated and often emotional discourse – which hinders informed decision-making. Personal data is increasingly seen as a pervasive, 21st-century asset class, like a stock or bond. That comes as business models are being built around unprecedented opportunities to create value through the flow of such data. According to the 2014 World Economic Forum report Personal Data: The Emergence of a New Asset Class, trust between individuals, governments and companies is necessary in order to fully unlock its potential.  Yet there is a crisis of trust, as stakeholders struggle to agree upon a personal data framework that is reliable and fair. Existing legal frameworks will prove inadequate, due to the speed of change and uncertainty about appropriate rights and responsibilities. The establishment of effective new frameworks must involve a truly democratic approach, if the public’s trust in data governance is to be restored.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.78"
"4.773","Trust and Visibility","","The low-profile approach to communications traditionally taken by family businesses will not work, amid increasing scepticism. A company’s brand and reputation are inextricably linked, and consumers are increasingly ready to boycott businesses they do not believe live up to their own values. Family businesses have a distinct opportunity to draw greater attention not only to the long-term value they create, but also to the values by which they operate. An Edelman Trust Barometer special report on trust in family businesses compiled in 2017 showed that they are trusted more than businesses in general by a 16-point margin. Yet, family businesses are squandering this advantage. Too many stay silent on their value and contributions to society. According to the special report, a majority of family business employees would recommend their company’s products and services to others, and would recommend it as an employer. More than twice as many respondents cited in the special report said they would prefer working for a family business than those who preferred working for another type of business, and nearly half of all respondents were willing to pay more for products or services if they are offered by a family business. Even though between 50% and 80% of all jobs are created by family businesses (according to the Family Firm Institute), fewer than one in three respondents cited in the special report saw family businesses as job creators. Respondents also expressed beliefs that non-family businesses are more innovative, financially successful, and adept at long-term thinking than family businesses. By staying silent and failing to correct these misperceptions, family businesses will fail to capitalize on their trust advantage. They must also take more visible leadership roles on social issues; two-thirds of special report respondents said that if a family business is not afraid to take a stand on controversial issues, it increases their trust in that business (respondents also wanted family businesses to create jobs locally and keep them there, address income equality, and encourage employee volunteerism). It is worth noting that 73% of respondents said knowing a company’s history helped to build trust, and that company founders enjoy a credibility advantage over second and third generation family members, and over non-family CEOs. Family businesses must tell their stories. Now is the time for them to showcase the value of their leadership and contributions.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.51"
"4.774","Turkey and the European Union","","Turkey experienced its biggest-ever inflow of foreign investment at about the same time that it began negotiations for accession to the European Union in 2005. The accession process, and the associated values and standards that it signals, are critical information for any business considering investing in the country. Interruptions to this process have had negative consequences, however - for the economy, transparency, human rights, and the rule of law. While 16 of 35 accession chapters have been opened, only one (related to Science and Research) has been provisionally closed; Turkey’s accession negotiations have therefore effectively stalled. The EU has highlighted concerns regarding the rule of law and fundamental rights, and an unresolved dispute over Cyprus has been a point of contention. In mid-2019, the EU suspended high-level contact with Turkey and shelved financial aid for the country, after it began pursuing gas exploration in Cypriot national waters. Turkey said it would nonetheless continue the exploration, and suggested that the EU is biased on the subject of Cyprus (which has been partitioned between an ethnically Turkish north and ethnically Greek south since 1974). The rift over gas exploration came as Turkey and the EU had been maintaining a steady dialogue. Then-European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, European Council President Donald Tusk and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan met in Bulgaria in early 2018, followed by a High Level Political Dialogue in Ankara later that year. While issues were discussed including counter-terrorism and security policy, with a special emphasis on Syria, Libya, and Iraq, there has been slow progress towards implementing joint action. A healthy relationship is crucial, not least because the EU is Turkey’s top trading partner, while Turkey ranked 5th among EU trading partners in 2018. As it deals with Turkey, however, the EU is meanwhile preoccupied with other challenges including the Brexit process, rising populism, and Euroscepticism. So, while full membership remains Turkey’s ultimate goal, the country’s own domestic political challenges and increasing doubts regarding the future of an integrated Europe have increased uncertainty about joining the bloc. Still, Turkey and the EU share multiple bonds - and maintaining constructive dialogue and cooperation on advancing mutual economic, political, and security interests is crucial.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.127"
"4.775","Turkey’s Public Spending and Unemployment","","Turkey’s Justice and Development Party (AKP), led by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, owes much of its electoral success to redistributive policies - in the form of social services, free medical clinics, the development of cheap housing, the legalization of squatter settlements, and the distribution of cash, food vouchers, and school stipends to its voter base. As general government final consumption expenditure in Turkey increased to 13.9% of GDP by 2015 from 10.8% in 1995, according to World Bank data, the country’s Human Development Index score (an assessment accounting for everything from poverty to life expectancy) improved to nearly 0.8 from 0.6 over the same period. In addition to the redistribution of public and private funds among the electorate, however, the AKP has embraced a discourse that contrasts the “pure people” and “corrupt elite,” according to a paper published by the LSE Middle East Centre in 2016. As the party has used such tactics to secure public support, voters in turn have tolerated a general decline when it comes to their rights and liberties. The government’s polarizing discourse has helped to justify its intervention in state institutions such as the courts, the central bank, the privatization administration, and procurement authorities - all in the name of preventing manipulation on the part of elites. The divisive rhetoric also comes as the Turkish unemployment rate has followed an upward trend following a 2001 financial crisis in the country, reaching 14% during the 2009 recession and again creeping above 14% as of early 2019. During that same period, youth unemployment followed a similar trajectory, reaching 25.2% by early 2019. What is perhaps most striking is the steep increase in female unemployment rate (amid a relatively low female labour participation rate); the female unemployment rate nearly doubled between 2001 and 2018, to 14%. This increase, and a broader increase in unemployment in general, can be viewed as factors behind widened income inequality in the country - which in turn feeds further polarization.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.127"
"4.776","Turkey’s Regional Role","","When Turkey’s Justice and Development Party (AKP) was founded in 2001, and swept to victory in the 2002 national elections, many people saw it as a possible model for political moderation and democratization in the Muslim world (in 2005, party leader and current President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan described the party’s agenda as “conservative democracy”). However, since then, the party’s increasingly autocratic policies - particularly after 2013, when the government faced a wave of public demonstrations and unrest - have dramatically changed its image. The ongoing civil war in neighbouring Syria has only added a further destabilizing element to Turkey’s domestic situation, while at the same time bolstering the country’s importance to other allies in the conflict supporting rebel forces - including the US, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar. More broadly, Turkey is a valued member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. However, Turkey’s decision in 2019 to purchase a missile-defense system from Russia provoked a rebuke from the US, which has argued that the acquisition is incompatible with NATO systems. Turkey has in recent decades sought to present itself as a strong, decisive player in global affairs - and has seemed willing to play the US and Russia against each other in order to pursue domestic interests. In terms of its regional cooperation, Turkey and the European Union remain significant partners in a turbulent context. The Ankara Agreement of 1964 providing a framework for cooperation, and the EU-Turkey Customs Union established in 1995 remain cornerstones of this arrangement. Healthy cooperation has been particularly crucial amid heavy flows of refugees from the Middle East who are often ultimately headed to Europe; As of June 2019, Turkey was hosting more than 3.6 million registered refugees from Syria, and more than 365,000 “persons of concern” from other countries, making it host to the largest number of refugees worldwide, according to The UN Refugee Agency. While the EU has committed €6 billion to help mitigate Turkey’s heavy financial burden as host to such a large refugee population, as of May 2019 only about €2.2 billion had been disbursed.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.127"
"4.777","Turkish Monetary Policy","","Central bank independence is considered a key pillar of macroeconomic stability. Following Turkey’s 2001 financial crisis, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey was granted independence to pursue a mandate of establishing price stability; during a subsequent period of inflation targeting (pulling policy levers to hit a publicized inflation goal), the central bank was able to establish its credibility by implementing relatively tight monetary policy that brought the inflation rate down to 9% by 2004, from 30% in 2002. However, in the following years political pressure mounted to lower interest rates and effectively make money cheaper for the voting public - particularly after 2010. The gap between the inflation target and the actual inflation rate proceeded to widen, with the average inflation rate between 2006 and 2018 settling at 9.4%, or nearly twice as high as the 5% inflation target during the period. The central bank’s ability to control long-term interest rates declined during this time, business cycles grew more volatile, and foreign investment dwindled - even during a post-financial crisis inflow of capital into emerging market economies. In response to this influx of capital, a number of central banks in emerging markets adopted new policy tools and sought to engage in some form of tightening to prevent a dangerously rapid expansion of commercial bank lending. Among the most popular tools used: the setting of reserve requirement ratios, which limit how much commercial banks in a country can lend relative to the reserves that they keep on hand as a cushion for periods of turmoil. Turkey’s central bank raised required reserve ratios after 2010, which enabled it to tighten monetary policy while still keeping interest rates relatively low. Turkey has a chronic current account deficit, however, with imports exceeding the value of exports, due to its dependence on imported oil and intermediate goods (which are combined to form finished products). This deficit, coupled with an increase in borrowing in the post-crisis era, has created challenges for the central bank. For example, in this era of abundant liquidity, setting high interest rates in a bid to target inflation can trigger unwelcome, speculative capital inflows - while keeping rates low can depreciate the local currency.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.127"
"4.778","UK Healthcare Delivery","","According to a survey conducted by Opinium in 2016, more than one third of respondents answered a question about what it is that makes them most proud to be British by citing the National Health Service. Since its creation in 1948, however, the NHS has been both hailed as a reliable source of free care and social cohesion, and criticized as inefficient and expensive. Campaigners for the UK to leave the European Union had suggested in the lead-up to the related popular vote that it could result in £350 million in additional weekly funding for the NHS; the UK’s Health Secretary subsequently clarified in 2017 that this would not be the case. According to the UK’s National Audit Office, the service swung to an £111 million surplus in 2016-2017, from a £1.85 billion deficit in the prior fiscal year - though the office has cautioned that NHS bodies are increasingly reliant on savings they cannot necessarily count on every year. The NHS’s funding issues come as it faces a series of significant challenges, including increasing rates of old-age-related disease among a generally ageing UK population, and increasing customer demand for tailored advice and healthcare.  Polls indicate that the UK public is strongly in favour of preserving the NHS in its current form. Still, a separate survey conducted by Opinium in 2017 found that nearly three out of five respondents felt the NHS was in a worse state than it had been five years earlier, and nearly half said they would be willing to pay higher taxes if they knew it would go directly to the health service. In June 2018, UK Prime Minister Theresa May outlined a long-term funding plan for the NHS, involving taxpayers likely making greater contributions to the service - which would in turn receive an additional £20.5 billion annually through the end of the 2023-24 fiscal year. May also pledged to contribute £1.25 billion more per year to NHS pension costs. Advances in medicine and healthcare technologies helping underpin the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and populations that are becoming more heavily skewed towards the elderly, are both posing financial challenges for entities like the NHS - and creating ethical questions. The NHS’s provision of patient information to the Google-owned company DeepMind, for example, is designed to better identify patients most susceptible to kidney failure, but has also raised privacy concerns.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.129"
"4.779","UK Migration Patterns","","The net migration of European Union citizens to the United Kingdom increased sharply after the 2004 enlargement of the EU, which saw the addition of eight countries in the east - by 2015, annual arrivals from the EU accounted for half of all migration to the UK, according to a report published by the charity Full Fact. This historical shift, from migration primarily sourced from within the Commonwealth to primarily from a roster of EU neighbours that has expanded eastward, was one of the key factors behind the UK vote in 2016 to leave the EU. While immigration from EU countries to the UK picked up in the years prior to the vote, according to the December 2015/January 2016 issue of the CER (Centre for European Reform) Bulletin, those patterns were actually not out of the ordinary within the context of other EU countries. However, British workers’ real wages fell sharply between 2008 and 2014 due to a recession that followed the financial crisis, with low earners suffering the most dramatic decline, according to the CER Bulletin; that created a false link in many peoples’ minds between declining wages and increasing numbers of migrants. According to the bulletin, British employers have historically been more open to hiring people with foreign qualifications than employers in other EU countries, leading to a pool of immigrants in the UK that is actually more skilled than in any other member state - and more likely to be employed than native Britons. The impact of Brexit on British employers’ ability to retain these employees and continue to recruit from the EU may have broad implications for the UK economy. A political declaration accompanying a draft withdrawal agreement that had been endorsed by EU member states in late 2018 included a commitment to establishing ""mobility arrangements” for UK and EU citizens and an agreement to consider conditions for entry and stay for purposes like research and youth exchanges - though that draft deal was later rejected by the UK Parliament, ratcheting up the possibility of a no-deal ""hard"" Brexit that would leave many such issues unresolved. Migration issues in the UK are not solely related to the EU; policy has also become more restrictive towards non-EU migrants, including Commonwealth citizens. In early 2018, the UK government was forced to apologize after deporting Caribbean immigrants who had been in the country for half a century, but were unable to prove they had a right to stay. The UK Home Secretary subsequently resigned.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.129"
"4.780","UK Relations with the EU","","The World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index for 2018 saw the United Kingdom fall two spots compared with the prior year, and noted that Brexit will inevitably weaken the “markets” component of the country’s performance. The ultimate effects of the UK’s departure from the EU, which is slated for October 2019, are unclear. EU leaders approved a draft withdrawal agreement in November 2018, but this was rejected in the UK’s House of Commons in January 2019. The scale of the UK government’s defeat in the Commons - the largest in 95 years - eroded hope for a parliamentary majority in favour of even a renegotiated exit deal, and ratcheted up the likelihood of a potentially traumatic, no-deal ""hard"" Brexit. The defeated arrangement would have had the UK pay £39 billion to extricate itself from EU liabilities, such as loans that the bloc has collectively made to individual countries. The UK Office for Budget Responsibility has said the payment would have been less than what the country would contribute to the bloc had it remained an EU member - though the UK will also likely pay as-yet-undetermined individual amounts to continue participating in select EU programs post-divorce. The impact of the impending split on the significant trade relationship between the UK and the EU remains unclear; as much as 51% of UK exports go to the EU, and as much as 56% of all UK imports arrive from the EU (as of mid-2018), according to HM Revenue & Customs. The proposed-but-ultimately-doomed departure deal would have protected existing rights for EU citizens to live, work, and study in the UK, and for UK citizens to do the same in EU states - as long as they had moved before the end of a transition period was slated to last until the end of 2020. The proposed deal also addressed the impact of Brexit on the border shared by Northern Ireland (which is inside of the UK) and Ireland (an EU member). Fears have been expressed about the ability of Ireland and Northern Ireland to retain customs-free trade, for example, should the UK not remain in a customs union with the EU. Under the terms of the proposed deal, the UK and EU would have entered into a joint customs area that would have eliminated a need for customs checks between Northern Ireland and Ireland.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.129"
"4.781","UK’s Role in the World","","The United Kingdom’s impending exit from the European Union has fuelled heated debate over what this means for the UK’s global role. Confidence in the country’s ability to make a success of Brexit is based on its plans to expand trade both with emerging economies and within the Commonwealth, on its “special relationship” with the US, and on an assumption that relations with EU partners will remain close. These pillars have become increasingly unsound. India, for example, the Commonwealth member with the world’s fastest-growing large economy, has linked deeper trade with Britain to concessions on immigration - an idea that has been rejected. Meanwhile, relations between Britain and the US have not improved under the Trump administration. The UK could not convince Trump to stay in the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, and another country, perhaps France, could potentially displace the UK as America’s primary European interlocutor. While Britain’s relations with the EU may fare better, a messy, ""hard"" Brexit that leaves unresolved budget disputes or questions about EU citizens residing in the UK could jeopardize this possibility. Britain’s prestige within international institutions is being closely monitored for signs of wear. In 2017, the country’s failure to elect a candidate to the International Court of Justice, its inability to win support for its position on the Chagos Islands at the United Nations, and its failed bid for sanctions on Russia at the G7 were reported as foreshadowing a post-Brexit decline. Yet, for the foreseeable future, at least, Britain should remain near the top of global economic, defence, and education rankings. In or out of the EU, it is a member of the G7 with the fifth-largest economy in the world. It will likely remain a nuclear power with both a permanent seat on the UN Security Council and some of the highest military spending levels in the world, as well as a participant in the world’s most powerful intelligence network, and the possessor of enviable diplomatic reach. One sign that the country may well retain its geopolitical status was its ability to swiftly rally allies in the wake of the poisoning of a former Russian spy on UK territory, in early 2018.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.129"
"4.782","Understanding Climate Risks","","Nine of the 10 hottest years on record have occurred since 2005. The global average temperature is now about 1°C above the pre-industrial average, and increasing by about 0.2°C per decade. Carbon dioxide released by burning fossil fuels and agricultural and industrial activity has raised the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to more than 400 parts per million - which has intensified the trapping of heat. Global warming is causing sea levels to rise and changing precipitation patterns, with increased rainfall in some regions and more extreme drought in others. Disasters triggered by weather- and climate-related risks are estimated to have been responsible for thousands of deaths and more than $300 billion in losses worldwide in 2017 alone. A National Climate Assessment issued in the US in late 2018 projected yearly losses of a similar magnitude there by the end of this century. A 2012 report published by the US National Academy of Sciences found that a 2°C rise in temperature could expose up to 20% of the world’s population to chronic water shortages (about 5% is now exposed). Under that same 2°C scenario, global agricultural yields by the end of the 21st century could decline by as much as 15% for staple crops such as maize. The Paris Agreement on climate change aims to limit global average temperature rise to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. A 2018 report published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change highlighted the need to limit warming to no more than 1.5°C; many ocean ecosystems, including the majority of the world’s warm water coral reefs, are likely to disappear if warming exceeds this level. Average global rise in sea level (projected to be about half a metre by 2100 if warming reaches 2°C) could be reduced by 20% by hitting the 1.5°C target, thereby protecting 10 million vulnerable people. A slower temperature rise could also help affected regions better adapt to climate change. In order to meet the 1.5°C target, however, countries must go well beyond their Paris Agreement commitments. And, because carbon dioxide persists in the atmosphere for centuries, models show that these emissions would have to cease entirely by 2050, while emissions of other, less-long-lived greenhouse gases would have to fall significantly. Achieving this will require far-reaching changes to many aspects of modern society, but could also help to create a more sustainable, equitable world.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.34"
"4.783","Understanding Inequality and Growth","","About one in seven children in Japan live in poverty, despite recent improvements in addressing the needs of the country’s poor. According to a 2016 report from the UNICEF Office of Research, Japan ranked 34th among wealthy countries in terms of children living in poor households, one notch ahead of Italy and four behind the US. Income inequality and poverty are relatively less visible in Japanese society than in other countries, and Japan’s assessment in the UNICEF report made a significant impact in the media. Japan has explored new models for developing an inclusive, sustainable economy that look beyond a GDP-centric approach to economic growth. For many years, in fact, Japan's relatively high standard of living has been at odds with public perception of lingering economic malaise. The country's GDP grew 1.7% in 2017, according to the World Bank, and annual growth has not topped 2% since 2010. However, observers have noted that the country's shrinking population means GDP per head has actually been relatively strong. And, as the Financial Times has reported, rough economic statistics may not take into account the difference between an elegant Mitsukoshi department store and a Wal Mart in the US, for example - and instead evenly attribute their respective contributions to GDP.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.88"
"4.784","Universal Access","","In 2015, the United Nations established Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), one of which is to ensure access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy for all by 2030. However, as of 2016, 1.1 billion people still did not have access to electricity, and many others had an inadequate, unreliable supply - primarily in rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa, India, and Southeast Asia. According to the International Energy Agency, present electrification efforts will not keep pace with population growth in sub-Saharan Africa, and the global citizenry that is doing without will become increasingly concentrated there. A lack of investment in generation plants and network infrastructure, subsidized tariffs that do not cover the cost of supply, poor governance, and insufficient legal security have contributed to this situation. Until recently, nearly all of those who had gained access to electricity worldwide did so through new grid connections, and about 70% of those who have received power since 2000 have done so via fossil fuels. In recent years, however, large-scale renewables (mainly hydro and geothermal) have been the source of over one third of new grid connections, while decentralized resources, such as solar home systems and microgrids, have supplied an increasing amount of electricity access. This trend is expected to accelerate. Technology improvements are creating opportunities to make progress on universal electricity access; the declining cost of solar, cheaper and more efficient lighting and appliances, and new business models that make use of digital and mobile platforms have increased the solutions available to those doing without. In order to realize the broader social and economic benefits of electrification, it will require looking beyond household connections and taking into account the electricity used for business and agriculture. The short-term impact of universal electricity access on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change is expected to be minimal, as the overall increase in demand will be relatively small (though the exact modes of electrification will determine long-term impacts). Providing electricity for all by 2030 would require annual investment of $52 billion, or more than twice what has so far been mobilized under current and planned policies, according to a 2017 report published by the International Energy Agency. Of the additional needed investment, 95% must be directed to sub-Saharan Africa, according to the report. Scaling up investment in electricity access requires the right policies and investment frameworks, and approaches that connect existing but uncoordinated initiatives will be needed.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.44"
"4.785","Unlocking Human Capital","","While youth unemployment and a relative dearth of entrepreneurship are common in the Middle East, they are particularly pressing issues in Saudi Arabia. The kingdom is in need of economic modernization, in order to put its fast-growing youth population to work. About 51% of Saudis are under the age of 25, while nearly three quarters are in their mid-thirties or younger. Meanwhile roughly two thirds of Saudis are employed in the public sector. The kingdom’s ability to develop its workforce and endow it with new skills will rely on establishing the necessary infrastructure. According to the World Economic Forum’s 2017 Global Human Capital Report, which ranked workforces according to attributes, Saudi Arabia placed 82nd out of 130 countries, and suffers from a high employment gender gap; according to the International Labour Organization, Saudi Arabia had only a 22% labour force participation rate among women as of 2016. While the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report for 2017 ranked Saudi Arabia 138th out of 144 countries, it noted that the country had made some progress. The kingdom’s decision to allow women to drive is expected to significantly augment their ability to work. Another potential asset is the kingdom’s migrant population of roughly 12 million (according to government figures); foreign workers include both high- and low-skilled varieties. The challenge for Saudi Arabia is to provide greater opportunity for these workers, while at the same time weaning itself of some of its traditional dependence on foreign labour. Youth unemployment remains a complex, structural problem that cannot be solved simply by budgeting additional funds. Technology disruption presents an opportunity for Saudi Arabia to get its youth population trained in more relevant skills, though it also presents challenges in the form of increased job automation. An estimated 46% of jobs in Saudi Arabia are susceptible to automation, according to the World Economic Forum’s 2017 report The Future of Jobs and Skills in the Middle East and North Africa. As the kingdom seeks to prepare its traditionally comfortable younger generations for the modern workplace, it must enable them to not only gain degrees, but also to develop critical thinking and entrepreneurial skills - and a willingness to work hard in order to achieve success.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.117"
"4.786","Urban Aerial Mobility","","Nearly all commercial flights now connect cities that are at least 300 kilometres apart. However, drone technologies in development are creating new opportunities for safe, economical aerial human transport both over short-haul routes and within cities. Electric, vertical takeoff and landing platforms - which often look like scaled-up versions of consumer and delivery drones - are being designed to move people around cities; commercial drone taxi services are expected in Dubai and Dallas by 2020. The development of detection and avoidance technologies for drones, and autonomous flight algorithms, can reduce costs by taking pilots out of aircraft. Meanwhile drone system traffic management could enable more intensive, and safer use of airspace. Although questions remain about the feasibility of moving large numbers of people through the air over short distances, increasing road congestion and the opportunity to reduce costs are drawing new related attention and investment from companies and governments. A number of models are emerging for how new types of air travel could be integrated into transportation networks, including personally-owned flying cars, a managed network of on-demand aviation, and a public transit-like system of aircraft flying between designated points on a fixed schedule. In any case, public concerns about noise issues stemming from expanded air traffic in populated areas must be addressed. If the cost of these new modes of air transit can be limited, they have the potential to better link people living in disadvantaged areas to better jobs further afield from their neighbourhoods, potentially reducing inequality. That could be a positive evolution from the current system of intra-city travel, by helicopter, which is primarily for the wealthy.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.42"
"4.787","Urban Diplomacy","","The C40 Cities Climate Change Leadership Group connects 90 cities and more than 650 million people, to facilitate collaboration on addressing climate change. In 2014, Ho Chi Minh City received technical assistance and investment from Rotterdam to better deal with rising sea levels and increasingly severe storms via the C40’s Connecting Delta Cities Network. Cities have increasingly made their presence felt in the global community, in the interest of their specific local needs and as a means to better find solutions to vexing urban challenges. At the 2014 UN Secretary General’s Climate Summit, the so-called Compact of Mayors, an ambitious agreement to commit to deep greenhouse gas emission reductions, was formed. In total, 447 cities, with a collective population of 391 million, committed to the compact. City mayors also played an important role in shaping the Paris Agreement on climate change. In 2016, the Compact of Mayors formally merged with the European Union’s Covenant of Mayors, a climate change initiative launched in 2008, in order to create a more powerful platform to demonstrate the global impact that cities can have. It was inevitable that cities would form closer international connections based on concerns about trade, infrastructure, culture, and migration. Increasingly, municipal leaders are asking why they are not part of discussions related to, for example, the UN Global Compact on Refugees - even as many refugees and internally displaced people end up in urban areas. In 2018, the ASEAN Smart Cities Network was launched, in order to bring together 26 Southeast Asian cities to learn from each other about how to become digital-ready. The twinning of cities is a longstanding practice; according to a UK Government Office for Science study on city diplomacy published in 2016, twinning has evolved to become more strategic, and has spawned multi-city coalitions as localities create joint projects and platforms where businesses can interact. Beijing alone has 47 “sister” cities, according to the report, and launched 114 “concrete cooperations” with 37 of these cities between 2009 and 2014, including shared efforts by the Bank of Beijing and the International Netherlands Group, and between Beiqi Foton Motor Co. and the City of Moscow.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.32"
"4.788","Urban Economies","","Currently, 600 cities generate close to 60% of the world’s economic output - numbers that are expected to remain roughly constant over the coming decade, though the geographical mix of these core urban areas will change significantly. Only a decade ago, roughly half of all global economic output was generated by fewer than 400 cities, all of them in advanced economies, and many in North America. This is projected to change dramatically, as economic power shifts towards Asia and other emerging market regions. Over half of today’s two dozen “mega cities,” or those with more than 10 million inhabitants, are in Asia, and more than half of these are in China. An urban economy is a city’s economic base, or the mix of economic functions that create value and employment. These functions are continually being transformed; though the pace can vary, depending on demographic or migration factors, local and regional fiscal policy, business cycles, and regional development efforts.  In Asia, where the legacy of the developmental state (where economic development is centralized and directed by the government) still looms large, big cities like Seoul have made efforts to transform their economic base by moving large-scale manufacturing to outer regions as they develop more service-oriented economies. Such efforts have been made for years in Hong Kong, and are now gradually being made in Beijing. While policies can transform the trajectory of cities in order to better support growth industries, urban areas also experience restructuring that is brought on by disinvestment, and an exodus of highly-skilled workers; a significant number are trending in this direction. In North America and Europe, for example, there are many examples of cities that are shrinking as their physical and social infrastructures decay. Whether in decline or ascent, cities need to balance their desire for a vibrant culture with a recognition of ways that they can become home to widening disparity. As cities work to embrace the same digital and innovative processes that are transforming business models, and creating economic value, this must be pursued in tandem with stronger social protection and inclusion measures that both help less-skilled and displaced workers find opportunities in expanding sectors, and increase access to the services that matter for households that subsist on stagnating wages.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.32"
"4.789","Urban Environment and Resources","","The ecological footprints of cities, or the productive areas required to supply them with resources while also absorbing their waste, need to be reduced. Cities consume more than 75% of the world’s energy, and are expected to generate more than 2 billion tonnes of waste annually by 2025 - compared with 1.3 billion tonnes of waste in 2012. The urban environment faces multiple threats: air pollution; climate change; and the rapid loss of green space and biodiversity. As they grow, they must therefore become more resource efficient, and protect the environment (including air and water quality) from the negative impacts of urbanization. Overstretched infrastructure plagues many cities, and authorities should implement policies that optimize the use of fresh water, electricity, and fuel. World Bank statistics have shown that electricity loss during transmission is about 5% for developed countries, while in less developed countries, such as Myanmar, that figure reaches as high as 20%; investment in overhauling power grids is therefore urgently needed. In addition, the World Resources Institute has estimated that the number of people living in water-scarce regions will grow from 1 billion presently to 3.5 billion by 2025. Urbanization is also connected to the degradation and loss of forests, grassland, and marine areas (it is estimated that 90% of the wastewater in developing countries is discharged directly into bodies of water). These ecosystems, both within cities (such as urban parks), and near cities (such as watersheds), are vital for sustaining urban areas, as they can improve air quality, provide for recreation, and moderate the effects of flooding and drought. Cities should better integrate both natural and constructed environments in order to form urban ecosystems, supported by related resource-planning and infrastructure policies. There are serious challenges in retrofitting existing cities to meet these goals; as a result, there have been radical attempts to build resource-efficient, green cities from scratch. One example is the proposed New Clark City, which is being constructed about 100 kilometres north of Manila. Two- thirds of this planned urban area would be reserved for parks, farmland, and other green space, and all of its buildings would make use of the latest technology to reduce energy and water use. Other, similar projects include Songdo, a smart city that features waste disposal via pneumatic tube in South Korea (though criticisms of that city’s vibrancy have surfaced), and Dholera, a utopian experiment in India.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.32"
"4.790","Urban Governance","","The concept of what makes for good urban governance is often shaped by the broader economic and political context: in the 1990s, the privatization of public resources like electricity and water occurred regularly, as policy-makers adopted the prevailing economic orthodoxy of an era when it was believed to be more effective to have private entities take over some of the management of cities; meanwhile in some countries a shift towards the decentralization of urban governance has been influenced by prevailing political ideology (most notably in Southeast Asia, where many economies once relied heavily on the centralized governance of urban areas). Urban governance, or the day-to-day management of keeping cities running and planning for their future development, can involve multiple entities. The government, the local business sector, non-governmental organizations, and urban inhabitants themselves can all play a role. Good urban governance, often driven by visionary and dynamic mayors, is an important part of solving urban problems such as poverty, congestion, and environmental pollution. According to the United Nations Human Settlements Program, or UN-Habitat, good urban governance means improving the overall quality of life in cities, particularly among the marginalized. UN-Habitat’s Urban Governance Index is designed to help cities monitor and improve their governance, in terms of transparency, accountability, and inclusivity. Increasingly, a mark of good urban governance is cities’ ability to raise capital; that, in combination with good governance and active civic engagement, can overcome serious challenges. One example of this is Seoul, the 2018 winner of the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize (a biennial award conferred at the World Cities Summit). In particular, Seoul was recognized for bottom-up processes that had been incorporated into the daily running of the city under its Community Governance Project, an initiative that gives residents a say over local issues that directly affect their communities. Seoul residents are actually given control of 5% of the city’s budget, under the so-called Public Participatory Budget System. Through measures like this, the city has been able to build greater trust with its citizens, and convince them that engagement is not a token act but rather a necessary part of making Seoul a better place for everyone.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.32"
"4.791","Urban Infrastructure and Services","","An estimated more than 700 million urban residents have no access to piped water, and more than one quarter of the world’s urban population continues to live in informal, haphazard settlements that lack the most basic infrastructure and services. Asia alone is projected to require $1.7 trillion per year in infrastructure investment until 2030, in order to address both new and legacy infrastructure needs. Cities require a broad range of basic infrastructure and services in order to be viable: the provision of piped water; sanitation systems; a power grid; roads; a public transportation system; housing; hospitals; and schools. Particularly in developing countries, cities face considerable challenges in providing and maintaining these infrastructure and services. Accelerating infrastructure development is essential for economic growth, as it can create jobs, alleviate poverty, and improve urban liveability and sustainability. Establishing robust infrastructure and services is also necessary to boost resilience, in the face of challenges like climate change and rising sea levels. Currently, the capacity of urban infrastructure is often overwhelmed by the cascading effects of rapid urbanization, sprawl, and demographic shifts. Weak urban governance and capital constraints can exacerbate these issues. As a result, some cities, from Australia and China, and from Europe to North America, have begun to rethink what is possible for the future of urban areas. New conceptions of sustainable urban forms include so-called compact cities, where high residential density and efficient public transportation are emphasized, and eco-cities specifically designed to curb carbon emissions. Some places have been able to harness technology and the non-governmental sector to address their issues. The Australian social enterprise Pollinate Energy, for example, has offered solar-powered products including water filters and clean cookstoves in Indian slums; six years after its founding, Pollinate Energy had provided tens of thousands of products to more than 20,000 families. Meanwhile the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank has financed dozens of infrastructure projects collectively worth about $4 billion in developing countries since it was established in 2016. These include a public train line in Bangalore, slum upgrades in Indonesia, and a broadband infrastructure project in Oman. China is actively pushing its Belt and Road Initiative, which will fund large infrastructure projects throughout cities on a massive scale, such as highways, ports, and IT systems, in order to strengthen ties with other countries in Asia and further afield.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.32"
"4.792","Urban Innovation","","The European Commission has launched a Digital Cities Challenge, China's Xiongan New Area aspires to transform a barren landscape into a digital city powered by blockchain and artificial intelligence, Global Digital Seoul 2020 is focused on developing e-government in South Korea’s capital, and India boasts a Smart City Mission; cities must seek to innovate in order to become more sustainable, advance social well-being, and boost economic competitiveness. The technologies fuelling the Fourth Industrial Revolution can multiply innovation, though potential perils have also multiplied. Technologies can be misused to disrupt economies and splinter societies; jobs can be eliminated; and socio-economic differences can be amplified. To help manage this risk, cities are experimenting with regulatory sandboxes, participatory design, innovation systems, and public-private partnerships. Ultimately, cities must reckon with a potential clash between economic value and societal values. With ride-sharing, for example, supply and demand can be better predicted and matched; but regulatory dust-ups and protests, from Montreal to Montevideo and Melbourne, demonstrate how societal values can be at odds with simple economic value. Cities, and companies, are increasingly sensitive to this potential clash. DeepMind, the artificial intelligence company acquired by Google, formed an Ethics and Society unit in 2017, to help insert ethics in the work of scientists in the field of AI. Singapore has meanwhile announced an Advisory Council on the Ethical Use of AI and Data, and Japan's ""Society 5.0"" envisions a “human-centric” society transformed by the Fourth Industrial Revolution. While cities innovate in order to compete with one other, they innovate better when they connect and cooperate in an organized way. Taiwan, for example, has designated different cities for different specific test-beds, in order to maximize experimentation and learning. The European Union's Sharing Cities program is testing smart lampposts in several cities, and aims to eventually scatter them across the continent. The ASEAN Smart Cities Network has 26 Southeast Asian cities partnering with companies in order to improve sustainability and competitiveness, and to learn from each other. The most successful cities will not be those that solely focus on innovation at the expense of other needs; they will be those that manage to recognize and adapt to specific local challenges, while pushing innovation forward.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","['1.32', '1.62']"
"4.793","Urban Migration","","China’s economic growth in recent decades has lifted about 700 million people out of poverty, according to government figures. During this period, China also witnessed the largest migration ever from rural to urban areas. About 59% of China’s population lived in a city as of 2018, according to estimates, and the country’s urban population is increasing at a rate of 2.4% annually (compared with 2.4% in India, and less than 1% in the US). This migration trend has created so-called megacities that have populations in the tens of millions, and significant challenges in terms of environmentally sustainable, socially inclusive growth. Migration into cities has led to heightened demand for health insurance, pensions, schools, and housing, as more Chinese leave traditional, family-based support systems. Increasingly congested cities need better urban and transport planning, and more jobs will have to be created, mainly in service sectors, in order to absorb migrants. The Chinese Government has embarked on regional economic planning projects such as the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the Yangtze River Economic Belt, and the Pearl River Delta Economic Zone, in order to pool resources and ensure policy coordination on infrastructure and urban planning. Taxi sharing is a good way to cut down on urban congestion and pollution, and it is becoming more prevalent in China due to digital ride-sharing services. According to a 2016 World Economic Forum report, Didi Chuxing passengers were already sharing an average of about 1.1 million rides per day by 2015. Bicycle sharing services are also a major focus; startups like Mobike and Ofo have been founded on the idea that bicycles can provide a cheap, easy, and environmentally friendly way to navigate China’s urban areas, facilitated by smartphone use. From 2005 to 2015, China's high-speed railway development came to account for 60% of the world’s high speed rail capacity, according to a government report. By 2020, China is expected to invest a further RMB 3.5 trillion in an additional 11,000 kilometres of capacity, connecting 250 cities with a total population of 700 million, according to research published by Morgan Stanley. The key to sustainable urbanization in China will be the ability of local and municipal governments to strike the right balance between growth that is visible in financial statistics, and sustainable growth that focuses on improving the quality of life.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.30"
"4.794","Urban Resilience","","The tsunami-triggered Fukushima nuclear plant meltdown, in 2011, forced the Japanese government to address systemic regulatory shortcomings and technological inadequacies in the country’s nuclear sector. While urban areas can become stronger in the aftermath of a catastrophe, it is a less-than-ideal way to bolster resilience. Urban resilience is a measure of how well communities, businesses, and government agencies can withstand both temporary shocks and chronic stress; increasingly, it is an essential goal for urban planners everywhere. The Rockefeller Foundation-funded City Resilience Index provides dozens of indicators that cities can use to measure their resilience, including safe and affordable housing and effective sanitation, and it has been tested in cities including Hong Kong and Liverpool. Meanwhile the World Bank Group’s City Resilience Program is designed to foster investment in viable projects that can enhance resilience. In practice and in theory, urban resilience must go beyond merely managing urban challenges like chronic under-employment, transportation system failures, housing shortages, and social strife by merely reacting to them. Instead, it should focus on proactively anticipating and preparing for potential risks. Still, it is often only following catastrophe that city governments will seriously implement system-wide changes. The distinction between the temporary shocks and chronic, long-term stress that affect urban areas is sometimes unclear. Social upheaval that seems to have been triggered unexpectedly, for example, is often underpinned by longstanding underlying tension. Indonesian riots in 1998, for example, were triggered by multiple systemic and sustained problems in urban centres such as widespread unemployment, food shortages, an escalating cost of living, and an increasingly bifurcated society along class and ethnic lines. Building urban resilience is a difficult, continuous process that requires good governance and significant capital investment. In many cities, resilience is hindered by geography; Jakarta is increasingly vulnerable to floods, as 40% of its land area is below sea level and generally over-developed. Other threats to resilience include viral epidemics (such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome in the early 2000s that killed hundreds of people in Asia) as well as natural hazards exacerbated by poor infrastructure and services (such as Hurricane Katrina in the US in 2005, which claimed thousands of lives). As urban societies become more digitalized and networked, cybersecurity lapses can also compromise resilience; in 2016, Uber admitted that 57 million of its users in the United Kingdom had been affected by a data breach.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.32"
"4.795","Urban Society","","In 2018, the United Nations Department of Social and Economic Affairs reported that 55% of the world’s population was living in urban areas, and estimated that the figure will reach 68% by 2050. This relentless rural-to-urban shift will add 2.5 billion people to cities, coming in search of a better life, new opportunities, and excitement. As a result, cities will face massive challenges, like insufficient decent and cheap housing, expanding waste management needs, growing demand for access to clean water and employment, and worsening traffic congestion. Technology can help, as policy-makers seek to manage diverse populations infused by migrants representing different ethnicities, cultures, and religions, and cope with the needs of ageing populations as they attempt to address inequality. Singapore, for example, is a mosaic of multi-racial and multi-religious communities, carefully managed through the city state’s policies designed to encourage inclusivity - such as the allocation of public housing done in a way that avoids ghettoization, and education and public service programs that foster integration. While the population diversity that must be addressed in developed countries like Singapore is largely attributable to international migration, in developing nations it is mostly a result of internal migration. Internal migration remains a significant feature of East Asian countries in particular, according to the International Organization for Migration’s World Migration Report 2018. Indonesia alone has an estimated 9.8 million temporary internal migrants, according to a UN report, while Malaysia is a heavily urbanized country (at 75% of the population) where internal migration constituted nearly 89% of all migration, and about 40% of Beijing’s population are migrants. Addressing diversity also means not leaving people aged 60 and over behind, as this demographic is expected to double in size by 2050 globally. In Japan, where 27% of the population is aged over 65 (according to the UN), the government has made radical changes to healthcare delivery; long-term health care insurance was introduced there in 2000, to supplement the national pension plan. Japan is also a leader in using robotics to assist the elderly. Another challenge: cities must deal with the inequality between those plugged into globalization and those left behind, particularly in high-tech hubs where growing wealth has left the middle class unable to buy homes, as is the case in San Francisco.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.32"
"4.796","Urbanization and Circular Practices","","The global urban population has grown rapidly; more people now live in urban rather than rural areas, and a report published by the United Nations has projected that an additional 2.5 billion people will be living in urban settings by 2050. This increased urbanization brings many challenges, but also many potential benefits - particularly in terms of the broad shift towards a circular economy (that is, an economy that is based on reusing materials for production, in order to reduce waste and benefit the environment). For example, urbanization enables the more efficient deployment of integrated systems for recovering materials after they are used, such as household food waste. The Belgian startup Cirkle delivers seasonal produce directly to customers’ homes, then takes back waste including recyclables and used cooking oil - which is later used to produce biodiesel. Circle Economy, an Amsterdam-based non-profit, provides a Circle Cities Programme, to help cities transition to a circular economy by tapping related knowledge at universities and research organizations which is then put into practice by member companies. The non-profit notes that two-thirds of global energy is used in cities, as are 70% of all global resources. Cities play a central role in the global economy (Circle Economy also estimates that 80% of global GDP is generated in cities), and present intriguing opportunities for the implementation of circular principles. The centralization and concentration of demand within an urban area can enable more efficient and cost-effective logistics, for example; that is because high population density can facilitate increased collection frequency, and shorter travel distances. So-called reverse logistics in particular, which involves the collection of used products in order to reuse or dispose of them, could better thrive in an urban setting, according to a whitepaper published in 2018 by the World Economic Forum in collaboration with the consultancy PwC. The ability to better centralize the collection of used items like clothing and household goods in a city could provide a boost to such practices, according to the whitepaper, and related models should be relatively inexpensive to test. The same principle can be applied to medical waste; according to the whitepaper, a voluntary group in Coimbatore, India has used a collection box where people can drop off their unused or unopened medicines for later redistribution to people in need at facilities for the elderly.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.31"
"4.797","Urbanization and Climate Change","","The urban population in the Middle East and North Africa region grew four-fold between 1970 and 2010, and is expected to double in size between 2015 and 2050 to nearly 400 million people, according to a report published by the International Organization for Migration. As of 2017, nearly 65% of the entire population in the region lived in cities, compared with a global figure of 55%, according to data published by the World Bank; the figure reached 91% in Jordan, and 86% in the United Arab Emirates. This urban concentration is expected to become more intense as climate change continues to have a devastating impact on rural economies, pushing more people into cities in order to seek out new ways to earn a living. According to a report published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, by 2025 the southern Mediterranean region will experience a significant rise in average temperature compared with 2007, which will increase aridity, lower soil humidity, and shift seasonal rainfall patterns. These changes have already been the cause of migration from the countryside into cities in Syria, Yemen, and Egypt, where the Nile River is the lifeline of an otherwise arid country. According to an IPCC report published in 2018, a rise in sea level of as much as 77 centimetres is expected by the year 2100, if we can limit global warming to 1.5°C - at a 2°C rise, the rise would be 10 centimetres higher. While 10 centimetres may not seem like much, it would mean exposing up to 10 million more people to related risks, according to the report. In the MENA region, this would spur greater refugee flows into cities, and place an even greater strain on urban infrastructure. High levels of rural-to-urban migration also upend traditional family and community protection mechanisms, replacing them with public benefits, and contribute to social instability - as migrants disconnected from family and patronage networks may be more easily influenced. However, increasing urbanization may also offer opportunities; urban areas in the MENA region could attract greater amounts of talent, investment, and startup activity. That could in turn help cities address issues like limited fresh water availability with desalination, for example, by applying entrepreneurial ideas and technology innovation.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.97"
"4.798","Urbanization, Migration and Real Estate","","A relentless quest for better job opportunities, higher wages and a better quality of life is fuelling increased migration into cities. The United Nations has predicted that the proportion of the global population living in urban areas will grow to 68% by 2050, from 55% as of 2018; that would add another 2.5 billion people to cities, with most of that population growth occurring in Asia and Africa. This will have an inevitable impact on the ways that urban real estate is designed, developed, and sold. For example, as growing urban populations age, developers must consider how best to accommodate them with appropriate designs, and competition for prime assets in key markets will likely increase - which will in turn push investors towards higher levels of risk (and returns) in fast-growing cities, according to a report published by the consultancy EY in 2016. Governments around the world are grappling with the substantial economic, environmental and health effects that urbanization is having on communities. Left unaddressed, the effects that these migratory patterns will have on urban centres will lead to an increase in the cost of housing, elevated social tension, and growing obstacles to building a sense of community. The existing socioeconomic fabric of many cities could disintegrate, and the liveability of urban centres may be compromised. However, urban planners can find sustainable solutions. The real estate sector can play a positive role, by making intelligent use of common spaces, for example, and catering to a broad range of activities and housing requirements in a bid to help alleviate tension and limit price increases. And, the deployment of environmentally-friendly infrastructure (that also facilitates social mobility) can play a significant role in improving the quality of densely-populated urban centres.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.112"
"4.799","Using Space to Increase Access","","About half of the global population is still not using the internet, according to the International Telecommunications Union. Even in countries with relatively high rates of broadband internet penetration, there are often issues with traffic congestion - which will likely only get worse in the future as the global appetite for content like video increases. Satellites are in a position to address this. They can be used alongside Wi-Fi, for example, to deliver high-quality, media-rich content to users while easing congestion. However, the cost of developing the space-based infrastructure required for universal internet coverage would be prohibitive. A number of ways to address this have been proposed by private companies. OneWeb, for example, is a startup planning to put more than 600 satellites in low Earth orbit (at an altitude of about 2,000 kilometres or less), in order to provide global coverage potentially before the end of 2019. Meanwhile Elon Musk’s company SpaceX has requested permission to launch a constellation of 4,000 satellites and up to 1 million earth stations to bolster global internet coverage. The impact of such systems may be profound, with implications for services including distance learning for students unable to physically attend school. The greater availability and resolution of satellite images is enabling new ways to deal with global challenges like climate change. Policy changes have helped; the US government’s decision to make Landsat satellite images and other data freely available to the public for scientific and educational use generated estimated benefits of $1.8 billion a year for US-based users, according to the World Bank’s World Development Report on Digital Dividends published in 2016. When made widely available, such data can bolster efforts like the Brazilian government’s monitoring of forest conservation compliance, or efforts to create development assistance mechanisms such as the GiveDirectly project in Kenya and Uganda (which uses machine learning to identify extremely poor villages in satellite images and deliver cash transfers to residents). Public and private entities must strike the right balance between commercial freedom and security, in order to achieve greater cooperation on programs that can expand access to communications networks. Governments everywhere should pay more attention to space as a means to improve connectivity, and the private sector should embrace related discussions. By connecting people everywhere to broadband internet, and better monitoring global change through satellite technology, we can seek to ensure that nobody gets left behind.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.120"
"4.800","Value Chain Efficiency","","Food pricing and supply are increasingly volatile as a result of more frequent extreme weather events, trade restrictions, and commodity market fluctuation. Meanwhile rural, smallholder farmers in developing countries often lack timely information on market prices, agricultural techniques, and weather, and have limited access to traditional financial services - making it relatively difficult for them to adjust production, or expand operations by investing in infrastructure. Smallholder financing opportunities are currently limited; social impact investors have so far met only a small portion of related demand. However, a market estimated to be as large as $450 billion could be tapped if financial services were sufficiently extended to smallholders. New financing structures, like so-called blended finance (where public and private investors carry a tailored amount of risk) could help create a more abundant supply of credit. Investing greater amounts in smallholder agriculture could not only boost productivity and income, it could also help develop local markets and encourage the sustainable management of resources. However, capitalizing on these opportunities requires a supportive regulatory environment. Multinational companies are increasingly relying on smallholder “value chains” (the entire process of adding value to a product) in order to satisfy growing global food demand. Many are supplying technical assistance to support productivity, and creating more awareness of the environmental and social dimensions of food loss and waste. Experts have distinguished between food loss, which results from inadequate technology and poor infrastructure along a value chain, and food waste - which is linked to consumer awareness and behaviour. A Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations report published in 2013 found that roughly one third of food produced for consumption is lost or wasted along the value chain - or 1.3 billion tons of food. The report found significant variations of food loss and waste across regions; more than half in Europe, North America and Oceania occurs at the consumption stage, while in developing countries it takes place during production, handling, and storage (in North America and Oceania, for example, 42% of total food available is lost or wasted, and 61% of this occurs at the consumption stage). It has been estimated that halving the current rate of food loss and waste could close the global “food gap” separating the dietary access of the rich and poor by about 20%, by the year 2050.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.60"
"4.801","Value-Based Healthcare","","The $8 trillion global healthcare sector is beset by costs that are rising at about twice the rate of global GDP growth, and by reimbursement mechanisms that are resulting in substantial waste and underinvestment, according to Value in Health Care, a report published in 2018 by the World Economic Forum in collaboration with The Boston Consulting Group. In response, many industry leaders are embracing so-called value-based healthcare, which prioritizes improved health outcomes without increasing cost, and utilizes systematic measurement to customize intervention and treatment pathways (efforts for a patient based on defined resources). One particular related effort cited in the report is the Atlanta Heart Failure Pilot in the US, which focused on congestive heart failure (a condition that affects about 6 million people in the country, half of whom die within five years of initial diagnosis). Total costs associated with the disease are expected to rise to nearly $70 billion by 2030, from $30.7 billion in 2012 - and there has been significant variation in related outcomes. Lessons from the Atlanta pilot included the need to build a clear case for change, and to enlist strong and visible public-sector leadership. In many parts of the world, ageing populations have added pressure on healthcare systems. In response, efforts to better realize value for this expanding population of patients are underway. According to a report published by the consultancy BDO in 2018, new business models and new types of investment will be needed for value-based elderly care, which facilitate a focus on prevention and rehabilitation - while boosting innovation. Increasingly, hospital stays for the elderly are being replaced by increased outpatient care and recovery either at home or in a nursing home. In the meantime, efforts must be made to develop the professional workforce needed to accommodate ageing populations and their health needs. According to a discussion paper published in 2016 as part of the National Academy of Medicine’s Vital Directions for Health and Health Care Initiative, the number of board-certified geriatricians in the US at the time was estimated at 7,500, or less than half of what was needed - due to factors including a financial disadvantage related to working in fee-for-service systems, where geriatricians must provide more time-intensive care for patients who are on Medicare (a national health insurance program) or both Medicare and Medicaid (a program for those with limited income).","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.71"
"4.802","Valuing Water","","The World Economic Forum has consistently ranked water crises among the most prominent issues listed in its annual Global Risks Report (it was ranked fifth in terms of impact in the 2018 edition). Global economic growth is increasingly thirsty; demand for water is rising, in order to meet the needs of growing populations and expanding industries. Unfortunately, however, water is often managed in isolation, and water-intensive sectors such as energy, mining, agriculture, and manufacturing have a tendency to pursue individual plans that are potentially damaging to rivers and aquifers. This fragmentation in planning exacerbates risks for businesses and their investors. CDP, a non-profit research organization that serves institutional investors, and the CEO Water Mandate (an initiative formed by business leaders under United Nations auspices), have consistently found that most companies believe they may be affected by substantial change related to water risk. As a result, more companies in water-intensive sectors are working to improve their understanding of water management challenges, and evaluating their own vulnerability to water scarcity. Some regions of the world could see their economic growth rates decline by as much as 6% of GDP by the year 2050, as a result of water-related losses in agriculture, health, income and property, according to a report published by the World Bank in 2016. However, the report also noted that some regions could see economic growth accelerate by as much as 6% over the same period, thanks to improved water resource management. Advocates of the “circular” economy approach, according to which products are reused rather than discarded, have emphasized economic values that could help reduce the wasteful use of water in production and agriculture. A report published by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation in 2018 presented circular economy-related opportunities for water including capturing greywater (waste water that does not contain sewage) for non-potable use. Water is a cross-cutting issue that affects all sectors of the global economy, and must be managed in a more integrated and holistic way. Increased transparency and community engagement will be important for determining values for water that reflect all social, economic, and environmental interests. If particularly water-intensive sectors can improve the way they work together in order to manage and value this resource, water pricing, trading, and allocation can become more efficient.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.134"
"4.803","Viet Nam's Rising Middle Class","","Viet Nam’s middle class is expected grow to 44 million people (equivalent to nearly half of the current population) by 2020, from 8 million people as of 2012, according to market research firm Nielsen. The expanding middle class is symptomatic of a general increase in prosperity in the country, where GDP per capita reached $2,186 by 2016, thirty years after Viet Nam began opening up its centralized economy as part of the so-called “Doi Moi” reforms, according to the consultancy PwC. Another insight from a PwC report: the population of ultra-high net worth individuals in Viet Nam rose 320% between 2000 and 2016, a faster growth rate than was experienced over the same period in both China and India. As more people in the country join the middle class and attain wealth, it will have profound impacts on consumption levels and the social fabric. As traditional social models are re-shaped due to greater economic mobility, educated, middle-class women, for example, may now find it more difficult to meet a suitable marriage partner, according to Vietnam’s New Middle Classes, a report published by the Nordic Institute of Asian Studies - due to being better schooled and better paid than many men. ﻿Household spending has become an important driver of economic growth in Viet Nam, and has helped to rebalance the economy away from a reliance on exports and towards greater domestic demand. That has provided a potential cushion for periods of global economic slowdown, or for future global financial crises. The growing presence of the middle class in Vietnam is also putting added pressure on existing social structures, by making society more open and prompting calls for greater accountability in the political system. It may also spur demands for greater political freedom. Viet Nam should nurture its middle class, by working to improve health and education systems, upgrading infrastructure, closing the income gap, and creating more educational opportunities. In the meantime the country must also improve its social safety net in order to both protect the most vulnerable, and to help create a healthy balance between the rise of the middle class and broader economic growth.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.132"
"4.804","Viet Nam's Startup Economy","","Aspiring young Vietnamese entrepreneurs were encouraged by the success of Nguyen Ha Dong, a developer from Hanoi who scored a global hit with his mobile game “Flappy Bird” after it was released in 2013. While the Vietnamese government is committed to the idea of supporting the startup community that has sprouted in the country, more supportive infrastructure and policies need to be developed. The word “startup” is heard much more now from the Vietnamese government, in its communication with ministries, with the public, and with other governments. Ministries, for example, have been asked to eliminate licensing or permitting processes that might create unnecessary barriers for aspiring startups. However, the government, and Vietnamese businesses, must be prepared to foster startups in the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is creating unsettling amounts of change in terms of technology innovation and related social development and employment trends. In 2017, Viet Nam adopted a law on supporting small- and medium-sized enterprises, which lays out principles for facilitating startups and entrepreneurs more generally. Viet Nam’s higher education system, which could serve as an incubator for technology and business innovation, is not currently conducive to a healthy startup environment. The country moved to 84th out of 137 economies in terms of higher education and training in the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index 2017-2018, from 83rd out of 138 economies in the previous year’s assessment. Viet Nam ranked 112th out of 137 countries in the latest Competitiveness Index in terms of availability of latest technologies, and 93rd in terms of firm-level technology absorption. Reforming the country’s overall education system, and higher education in particular, should be a top priority. However, there are some encouraging signs for Viet Nam’s development trajectory. The Forum’s Inclusive Development Index, introduced in 2017, benchmarks countries with indicators related to inclusion (such as poverty rate), growth and development (such as healthy life expectancy), and intergenerational equity and sustainability (such as carbon intensity of GDP). Viet Nam ranked among those countries that scored better on this index than peers with higher levels of GDP per capita - indicating that it has done a relatively good job of making its overall growth process inclusive.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.132"
"4.805","Violence and Instability","","Rising levels of criminal activity in some countries and within certain political systems have given rise to armed violence, destabilized governments, and fuelled armed terrorist groups. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime’s Global Study on Homicide published in 2018, organized crime is a leading cause of homicidal violence in some countries in the Americas - which has the highest homicide rate of any region in the world. In Mexico, for example, there were 33,341 murders in 2018, a 7% increase compared with the prior year that was partly a result of the fragmentation of large cartels and the government’s inability to react to smaller gangs killing for greater control of territory, according to the foundation InSight Crime. Conflict and insecurity are major barriers to development; a World Bank World Development Report published in 2011 noted that countries that had experienced relatively high levels of violence between 1980 and 2000 also suffered from an average poverty rate that was 21% higher than in countries with low levels of violence during the same period. Rapid urbanization and glaring income inequality (particularly in the southern hemisphere) have fostered slums beset by crime, violence, and a general lack of security. Cape Town is a prime example. Nyanga, a Cape Town slum, had the highest murder rate in the country as of 2018, according to the South African Government News Agency; the 308 murders reported there during the year ended in March 2018 marked a 9.6% increase compared with the prior period. Stark inequality and a lack of both educational opportunity and jobs have bred a sense of frustration and rage in Nyanga, according to a researcher at the University of Cape Town cited in a 2018 Bloomberg News report. In failed and failing states, fights over access to natural resources like minerals and oil has exacerbated conflict. Meanwhile in conflict zones in the Sahel region and Libya, illicit trafficking in drugs and the smuggling of migrants have served as a means to fund insurgencies. The failure of internationally-sponsored peace and transition processes to address illicit flows and provide a clear distinction between criminal activity and groups that have legitimate grievances, or to protect state institutions from the corrupting influence of the illicit economy, are recognized reasons for the resurgence of conflict and state failure.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.75"
"4.806","Volatile Business Cycles and Development","","Turkish business cycles are more volatile than those in emerging market counterparts, which is a result of both monetary and fiscal policies that have proven ineffective in terms of stabilizing the economy. One continuous, nagging problem is a current account deficit that limits the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey’s ability to raise interest rates - an inability that can threaten financial stability. The current account deficit partly reflects a production structure in Turkey that relies heavily on imports of intermediate goods, or goods ultimately combined to make finished products. Greater support for the country’s most competitive sectors might reduce this reliance (the central bank’s inability to raise interest rates also further feeds the current account deficit, because unchecked inflation discourages the saving of money and encourages external borrowing). Yet another trigger for relatively volatile business cycles is the frequency of political elections - which are inevitably accompanied by expansionary fiscal policies (lowered taxes, increased public spending) that boost demand to unsustainable levels and lead to sharp, subsequent slowdowns. After Turkey’s 2001 financial crisis, labour productivity increased annually by about 3.2% on average between 2002 and 2009. There was a reallocation of resources from the capital-scarce, low-productivity agricultural sector to higher-productivity sectors such as services, though overall annual productivity growth then slipped to 2.7% in the period after 2009 - as structural reforms were postponed. One consequence of the slowdown in productivity is a reliance on cheaper imports; when domestic productivity growth falls behind that of international counterparts, it becomes cheaper to import from abroad than to produce at home. Other shifts have included an urban renewal process over the past decade that spurred a transfer from industrial production to the construction sector, and led to a significant industrial sector decline. Turkey’s most recent urban development process differs from previous related efforts, by stretching beyond land already in use and penetrating ecologically-sensitive sites such as forests, beaches, drinking-water basins, and historical and agricultural areas - regardless of inevitable controversies.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.127"
"4.807","Water Data and Technology","","The speed and scale of technological advancements propelling the Fourth Industrial Revolution are transforming the global economy at a time when concerns about water have never been greater. This industrial revolution offers an unprecedented opportunity to confront water risk, and seize untapped economic opportunities in both developing and developed countries alike. Developments such as the Internet of Things, big data, artificial intelligence, sensors, advancements in material sciences, and faster computing power are changing the way the world manages its global environmental commons. For example, improvements in aeroponics, a technique of growing plants that does not require soil, has made it possible to reduce water consumption by 95% compared with conventional, soil-based agriculture, while meanwhile preventing environmental runoff (which can carry pollutants and contaminate drinking water). Similarly, advancements in laboratory-grown meat have the potential to eliminate the need for the more than 15,000 litres of water that it takes to produce a single kilogram of beef, according to a report published by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 2013. Emerging technologies can also help urban centres to become more resilient when it comes to their water systems. Singapore, for example, announced in 2018 that in order to help its water service cope with increasing demand and costs, the city-state is turning to technology such as artificial intelligence-powered imaging used to detect micro-invertebrates in water samples and trigger related alerts. Other examples of technology and data-driven infrastructure design employed to make water more sustainable include efforts in parts of the United Kingdom to use advanced sensors and connected Internet of Things devices to help identify leaks in water systems - which account for nearly 20% of water loss - and make them easier to repair. If they are implemented on a broader scale, such advancements could dramatically reduce global water demand, both for agriculture and for domestic use, while also helping to reduce related greenhouse gas emissions. Developments in data processing and collection, driven by artificial intelligence, can for example enable consumers, businesses, and governments to better understand their water needs - and eliminate unnecessary use in a way that contributes to more sustainable development.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.134"
"4.808","Water Infrastructure","","Water infrastructure can take many different forms, but it is the essential backbone of a modern economy. Drinking water distribution pipes, treatment plants, sewage reclamation, levees and dams built for flood protection, and canals that irrigate millions of hectares of farmland are all critical for economic growth and human well-being. Beneath the streets of any large city, are thousands of kilometres of water mains. Many of these systems are in need of renewal, in order to ensure water security. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has argued that because global interest rates are historically low, and needs are historically significant, now is an ideal time to scale up investment in water infrastructure - in order to secure well-documented benefits of clean, reliable water including  fewer child deaths from diarrhoeal disease (the second-leading cause of death among children under five years old, according to the World Health Organization), and increased labour productivity. However, current investment levels are insufficient to meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals related to drinking water and sanitation established in 2015 - let alone to repair aging municipal water systems in developed countries, expand existing systems to accommodate urban growth, meet stricter water-quality regulations, or adequately prepare for the effects of climate change. Opportunities to improve existing systems abound; it is not uncommon, for example, for large cities in India to lose half their water supply to leaks. According to an estimate published by the McKinsey Global Institute, $11.7 trillion must be invested in related global infrastructure between 2013 and 2030 in order to meet water and sanitation needs. Infrastructure is not only pipes, pumps, and treatment facilities - more decision-makers are recognizing the benefit of using natural systems to slow storm flows, store water, and cleanse runoff. As a complement to traditional, “hard” infrastructure, such green infrastructure options include street swales (vegetated channels used to reduce stormwater flows), wetlands, rainwater harvesting, and grassy roofs. All are small-scale alternatives that are less environmentally damaging than what has been used in the past. Green bonds, or debt raised specifically for environmental purposes, could be used to finance related investment; total issuance of green bonds reached $155 billion in 2017, a 78% increase compared with the prior year, according to a report published by the non-profit group Climate Bonds Initiative.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.134"
"4.809","Wellness and Environmental Sustainability","","There has been a growing sense of urgency about the real estate sector's ability to ensure that communities can be built in such a way that meets expectations for sustainability. Opportunities for these communities to thrive depend in particular on efforts to combat the adverse effects of climate change. The use of green technologies, energy-efficient ways of transporting people and goods, and the construction of energy-efficient homes can form an integrated approach to a healthier urban environment. Some examples of environmentally-responsible design elements include using sustainable, locally-sourced materials, installing rooftop solar panels, and using geothermal heating and cooling. Human-centred real estate design that not only provides comfort but also increases the quality of life for the broader community by improving healthcare delivery, increasing community engagement, and enhancing work environments can ultimately improve productivity. The real estate sector can therefore play a fundamental role in boosting economic competitiveness, by engaging with communities and taking into account the wellness of individuals in order to provide a more sustainable living environment, and by focusing on integrating new and potentially helpful technologies like the Internet of Things - which strings together homes, offices, devices and appliances via the web.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.112"
"4.810","Workforce Digitalization","","The insurance industry was long highly profitable, relatively immune to threats to its traditional business model (underwriting risk, collecting premiums, and paying claims), and the generator of relatively labour-intensive tasks. The result was a sizeable global workforce. In the US alone, the industry still employed more than 2.5 million people as of 2016, and in Switzerland, a country with a total population of roughly 8.5 million, the industry accounted for nearly 50,000 employees that same year. However, declining profit margins, low-yielding assets, and changing customer needs are forcing the industry to embrace technological change and cut costs - not least as both large technology companies and so-called “insuretech” startups provide growing competition. For insurance industry employees, many tasks will increasingly make use of technology developments like artificial intelligence and machine learning; employees will therefore have to become more focused on high-performance, high-skill, high-capacity jobs, according to a report published in 2017 by the consultancy EY. Particular new skills required of insurance industry employees include data analysis, a firm grasp of the behavioural sciences, and familiarity with technology facets like the Internet of Things. In addition, the distribution of insurance products will likely be transformed, as the industry becomes more dis-intermediated and brokers and agents find themselves in unfamiliar territory. A survey of 530 insurance agents conducted by EY in 2016 found that 40% questioned their preparedness to meet the needs of the next generation, and only about one in five felt they understood well how they fit into their carrier’s strategy. For agents generally, there will likely be a shift towards becoming more of a service provider to insurers, by managing claims and even performing underwriting. Overall, however, it will be difficult to re-train a workforce unaccustomed to significant industry disruption. Timing will be critical, and decisions on how best to hire and re-train will need to be taken sooner rather than later. In some countries, labour laws may hinder a timely transition. There will also be more intangible related issues to address, as the insurance industry has a reputation for being stodgy, bureaucratic, hierarchical, and slow moving, according to the EY report published in 2017.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.82"
"4.811","Workforce Skills","","Ethiopia’s performance in this area of the Index shows the greatest room for improvement in terms of the pupil-teacher ratio in primary education, where it has a progress score (ranging from a poor mark of zero to a top mark of one hundred) of 0.00, resulting in a rank of 135th out of 138 countries; and in terms of the number of years of completed education among the adult population where it has a progress score of 19.30 that results in a rank of 132nd out of 140 countries. Other indicators reflect a better performance: the ease of finding skilled employees, where it has a progress score of 44.80 that results in a rank of 102nd out of 140 countries; in terms of the quality of vocational training where it has a progress score of 45.40 that results in a rank of 94th out of 140 countries; and in terms of expected years of schooling for children where it has a progress score of 46.80 that results in a rank of 136th out of 140 countries.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","['1.49', '1.67']"
"4.812","Workforce and Skills","","Given that between 50% and 80% of jobs worldwide are created by family businesses, according to an estimate published by the European Family Businesses federation, it is crucial that family businesses foster a workforce that can thrive indefinitely, by actively skilling (training employees), reskilling (teaching them new skills), and upskilling (improving employees’ existing skills). In order to do so, businesses must first gain a solid understanding of the underlying trends transforming the nature of work. Technological innovation, particularly associated with robotics and artificial intelligence, have machines replacing medium-skilled workers in sectors including banking and retail. In other cases, machines are augmenting the work of humans at professional firms and in medical roles, through the rapid analysis of large data sets. Within the next ten years, the impact of machines will increase dramatically, particularly in lower-skilled work such as food preparation; around 30% of the global workforce will be significantly impacted. Demographic changes are also affecting the workforce. As longevity increases, people will be working into their 80s, while in many regions birth rates have fallen - resulting in an ageing global population (in developed countries, the average age of populations is poised to surpass 40). Family businesses need to anticipate the skills and traits that will become crucial for their operation, and support their development. These include a capacity to be innovative and creative; deep social skills and empathy; and, negotiation and collaboration. Evidence suggests that family businesses tend to be relatively responsible and caring employers, and maintaining a commitment to the long-term development of employees could further distinguish them from non-family-owned peers that may be under more intense, short-term market pressures. As the distinction between traditional gender roles fades, for example, and women take on more senior roles, family firms have an opportunity to proactively position themselves as the employer of choice - by looking more carefully at their selection processes, and promoting flexible working practices. Social transformation has changed the nature of gender and of families, and the father with a career and the mother as caregiver is being replaced by father and mother, or partners, each with a career. The fact that family businesses already employ a relatively high percentage of female leaders bodes well for the future. This key issue is curated in partnership with Lynda Gratton, Professor of Management Practice at London Business School.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.51"
"4.813","Workplace and Workforce Change","","Current work and retirement structures are based on 20th century norms. People now want to work past traditional retirement age, as public policies incentivize them to work in different ways. As of 2014, eight Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries had established official retirement ages over 65, and more were expected to follow. A more flexible approach to retirement is emerging; the 2015 Aegon Retirement Readiness Survey found that more than half of the respondents expected to retire at or after the age of 65, or to not retire at all, and more than half of those 55 and older anticipated a flexible transition into retirement that may involve reduced work hours and pay. Studies have shown that the employment of older people leads to increased employment and higher wages for younger workers. In addition, workers aged 60 or older are also more productive than those under 25, and actually generate productivity comparable to 35 to 54 year olds. The Kauffman Foundation has reported that in the US, the number of entrepreneurs aged between 20 and 34 declined between 1997 and 2015, while new entrepreneurs aged between 55 and 64 grew from 14.8% to 25.8% of the total. Increased rates of work among older populations may help extend pay-as-you-go pension systems such as 401k plans, where employees contribute specific amounts over time. Public pension expenditures are meanwhile expected to consume a significant portion of GDP in European countries by 2050, while China’s Academy of Social Sciences has projected large shortfalls for that country’s national and local pension schemes by 2050. Research published by the Brookings Institution in 2013 found that the trend of delaying retirement could boost general government revenue by as much as $2.1 trillion over three decades. The challenge lies in figuring out how to best transition to 21st century work models. Many people caught between the era of defined benefit pensions, which have offered payments from employers, and increasingly prevalent defined contribution systems, are failing to generate the savings they need. In addition, defined contribution plans remain inaccessible and underutilized. In the US as of 2016, less than half of private-sector workers participated in a retirement plan of any kind, according to data compiled by the Pew Charitable Trusts. These developments present a unique opportunity to re-evaluate entire retirement systems - both public and private - in order to ensure a more sustainable model.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.7"
"4.814","World-Topping Energy Demands","","India will have to manage a careful balancing act between consuming increasing amounts of energy in order to maintain its economic growth, and paying heed to the resulting climate change-related risks. According to the 2018 edition of the government’s annual Economic Survey, energy demand will have to increase fourfold in order to push India into the highest category of the Human Development Index. At the same time, the 2019 Global Climate Risk Index published by German think tank Germanwatch placed India 14th in a list of countries deemed most at risk from climate change. India is already the world’s third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, after China and the US. As of 2017, 60% of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions were generated by the energy sector, while 22% came from the industrial sector and 15% resulted from the agricultural sector. Currently, some 60% of total energy demand in India is being met by greenhouse gas-emitting thermal power plants, and only about a tenth by renewable sources; the remainder comes from nuclear and hydro power. India has pledged as part of the Paris Agreement on climate change to obtain 40% of its energy capacity from non-fossil fuel sources, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by between 33% and 35% by 2030. While Indians currently average a third of global per-capita energy consumption, that will have to rise in tandem with living standards. India has taken some steps to help achieve the United Nations’ the Sustainable Development Goals; it has nearly doubled the share of renewables in total energy generation over the past five years, and its renewable capacity is expected to double by 2022, thanks primarily to solar and wind. Among other measures, India has launched a “Perform Achieve and Trade” scheme assigning mandatory energy consumption targets to energy-intensive industries, while the “Standards and Labelling” programme provides consumers with basic information about energy- and cost-saving appliances. It is in India’s best interests to address climate change, as related erratic rainfall, falling groundwater levels, and deteriorating air quality will profoundly affect its people. The challenge will be to do this without compromising the economic growth necessary to pull millions out of poverty.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.77"
"4.815","Worsening Impacts","","Human activity has placed the environment under extreme stress. In 2009, an international group of scientists proposed the concept of “planetary boundaries,” within which humanity can continue to thrive for generations. Disrespecting these boundaries, which are tied to issues including climate change, freshwater use, and chemical pollution, could result in irreversible environmental change. So far, four of these nine boundaries have been crossed. About 400 billion metric tonnes of carbon have been released into the atmosphere due to the consumption of fossil fuels since 1751, and half of these emissions have occurred since the late 1980s, according to the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center. In addition, 2015, 2016, and 2017 were the three warmest years on record (followed closely by 2018), according to the World Meteorological Organization. Water stress is impacting communities and industries; the World Bank’s 2016 report High and Dry: Climate Change, Water, and the Economy estimated that 1.6 billion people live in countries with physical water scarcity, and that this number is projected to rise to 4 billion by 2050. Without a change in approach, the world could face a serious water deficit by 2030, with knock-on effects for sanitation and health, energy generation, and agricultural production. In 2015, Global Forest Watch reported that some 18 million hectares of tree cover - an area twice the size of Portugal - are lost each year. In 2016, the World Wildlife Fund’s Living Planet Report noted a 58% decline in the vertebrate population between 1970 and 2012, and it has been noted that ocean chemistry is changing faster now than perhaps at any point in the last 300 million years. Acidification is a concern for the tourism and fishing industries, and is potentially accelerating as the ocean’s ability to absorb carbon dioxide declines. According to United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization figures from 2016, nearly one third of the global fish stock is overfished, and illegal fishing removes about 26 million metric tonnes (close to $23 billion in value) of seafood a year. The stresses on the environment and natural resource security have become so great, with most of the impact yet to fully play out, that many academics now report that human activity, mass extinctions, and extensive pollution have demarcated a wholly new epoch for Earth - dubbed the “Anthropocene.”","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.48"
"4.816","Young People and Technology","","Despite widespread concern about the disruptive power of automation, an overwhelming number of respondents to the most recent edition of the World Economic Forum’s Global Shapers Survey, a window into how young people view the world, believe technology is creating jobs (78.6%) as opposed to destroying them (21.4%). However, opinion differed based on region; young people in Sub-Saharan Africa and Europe registered the lowest share of votes for “creating” jobs, for example. In general, young people are optimistic about technology and its benefits - not only for their personal lives, but for society in general. According to the survey, they believe sectors such as education, healthcare, and manufacturing will benefit greatly from the adoption of new technologies. There are limits on young peoples’ embrace of technology, however. When asked about the possibility of enhancing their capabilities through skin or brain implants, 44.3% rejected the idea. Far more males than females were open to the idea of an implant, according to survey results, and more than half of young people in low- and lower-middle income countries said a flat “no” to the idea (compared with 42.8% answering “no” in high-income countries). While young people might embrace technology as a means to improve their lives generally, they do not seem to like the idea of robot proxies. According to the survey, just over half of the young respondents could not imagine trusting a robot to make decisions on their behalf. In addition, nearly half of respondents would not support establishing rights for humanoid robots - though in one region of the world, North America, votes for “maybe” on this question actually outnumbered “no” votes. While they may embrace technology, young people are cautious about both the information that they share online, and about the information they receive from online sources, according to the survey. While nearly half of respondents said they had not shared a news item on social media that they later learned was fake, more than one fifth responded that they had likely done so - but without knowing about it. In terms of the “next big technology trend,” most respondents by far said they believe it will be associated with artificial intelligence. In the Middle East and North Africa region, however, respondents chose the Internet of Things as a close second.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.136"
"4.817","Young People and Work","","There is a widely-held assumption that millennials are lazy and entitled, tend to frequently switch jobs, and do not care much about work. However, the World Economic Forum’s most recent edition of the Global Shapers Survey, a measure of how young people see the world, provides a very different portrait. The top three criteria for young people when considering job opportunities are compensation, career growth, and a sense of purpose and social impact, according to the survey. The importance of gaining a sense of purpose underscores the notion that young people actually care about others and the environment, and about having professional opportunities to learn and grow as people. Nearly half of the survey respondents said their employers should ensure a positive work-life balance; in fact, more than one third of those between the ages of 27 and 35 indicated that, “I am willing to sacrifice work and salary to enjoy life.” However, young people are grappling with more fundamental challenges as they try to enter the workforce. According to the survey, they feel they are disadvantaged when seeking out new jobs due to having a lack of experience, a surplus of competition, and a lack of available work. According to survey respondents overall, the most important contribution that businesses make to society is creating jobs. However, in Eurasia the top choice was boosting the economy and attracting foreign investment, while in North America and Oceania, the top choice was improving livelihoods. Young people expect companies to address social and environmental problems. When posed with the statement, “companies should not be involved in addressing social problems that are not related to their business activities,” most respondents disagreed. Respondents highlighted things businesses can do to create a youth-friendly work culture: provide opportunities to contribute to vision and strategy, offer mentoring, and ensure that failure is accepted as a learning experience. Young people are increasingly aware of what they consume and who is providing it, and cautious about forming bonds of loyalty. Millennials tend to look closely at a company's commitment to sustainability and social responsibility, at how a company is covered in the media, and at its financial reports.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.136"
"4.818","Youth Unemployment","","As of 2017, 27% of the people aged between 15 and 24 in the Middle East and North Africa region were unemployed, compared with a global average of 13%, according to World Bank data. Young women have been particularly affected; the rate of youth female unemployment in the MENA region was 41% as of 2017, according to World Bank data, compared with a global figure of 15%. Youth unemployment in this part of the world stems from factors including a skills mismatch - as local school curricula tends to encourage memorization and rote learning, rather than skills more useful for the private sector such as creative thinking. The problem is also related to the incentives offered by the private sector, including salaries and working conditions that are often less attractive than the stability offered by the public sector. Meanwhile relatively rigid labour and other market rules mean that economies in the region suffer from a lack of diversification and development. The absence of bankruptcy regimes in many Arab countries also discourages entrepreneurial risk-taking, further inhibiting innovation. These structural challenges are compounded by massive demographic changes that are underway. A 2015 European Union Institute for Security Studies report, Arab Futures: Three Scenarios for 2025, projected an average of 3.1 births per woman in Arab countries between 2015 and 2020, compared with a global rate of 2.7. That translates into a population in the Arab world of 468 million by 2025, compared with 357 million in 2015. This increase, alongside growing migration within the region due to refugee flows and the impact of climate change, promises to further exacerbate youth unemployment - and in turn to present further risks to social and political stability. Large numbers of unemployed young people can contribute to the sort of polarization and political unrest that discourages foreign investment. Meanwhile a correlation between expanding youth populations and violence has been established; the EU’s 2015 study on Arab Futures noted that between 1970 and 1999, 80% of civil conflict in the region occurred in countries where nearly two-thirds of the population was both under the age of 30 and unemployed. In these countries, every percentage point gain in youth population increased the risk of conflict by 4%, according to the study.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.97"
"4.819","Youth Unemployment in Nigeria","","Nigeria’s relatively lacklustre economic development can be attributed at least in part to its infrastructure; the country was ranked 124th out of 140 economies in terms of infrastructure in the World Economic Forum’s 2018 Global Competitiveness Index. While Nigeria may have the second-largest economy in Africa (after South Africa), it remains heavily constrained due to its infrastructure situation. In 2016, the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry estimated that the country’s infrastructure deficit amounts to roughly $300 billion - more than 10 times the size of the entire national budget for 2018. In terms of quality of roads, Nigeria ranked 132nd out of 140 economies in the Forum’s Competitiveness Index, while its efficiency of train services ranked 127th (of the roughly 3,500 kilometres of railway inherited from the British after colonization, only a small portion is now operational). The country’s electricity sector is also lagging; it ranked 114th in terms of electrification rate in the Forum’s index. Barring significant basic infrastructure improvement, it is difficult to see how Nigeria’s economy can meaningfully expand. Comparing its infrastructure needs to the extent of Nigeria’s significant government revenue can be a depressing exercise; it can sometimes be difficult to find evidence that funds earmarked for the purpose have actually been spent on infrastructure, which suggests mismanagement. Nigeria’s growth potential is immense, given its large population, abundant resources, and entrepreneurial spirit. In order to address the infrastructure deficit, Nigeria’s government has initiated policies including power sector reforms and the Petroleum Industry Bill (passed in parliament in 2017, to jumpstart growth in the sector by increasing transparency). The electricity sector is being privatized, and the government has implemented a bid to meet 30% of the country’s energy needs with renewables by the year 2030. The government has also sought to collaborate with international institutions and foreign governments in order to better address its infrastructure needs. For example, a number of infrastructure development projects have pushed ahead in collaboration with Chinese companies; China Civil Engineering Construction Company is involved in projects in the country including the Lagos airport expansion, road building, urban light-rail construction, and contract worth a reported $11 billion to build a railway connecting Lagos to Calabar, according to a report published in 2018 by the United States Institute for Peace.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.101"
"4.820","Youth and Gender Issues","","A United Nations report published in 2018 noted that less than half of all young people in Pakistan have mobile phones, just 15% have access to the internet, and about 90% suffer from poor access to recreational facilities. In addition, 57% of young people are neither employed nor seeking work. There are 163 universities in Pakistan, though higher education enrolment is just 4% - far lower than in India (11%) and Malaysia (32%). Even when young people receive a good education, they are often unable to find good jobs to utilize their skills - and frequently end up feeling humiliated. As a result, they become more inclined to become depressed, use drugs, and commit crime. The promotion of entrepreneurship among young people should increase, not least because of a culture of family-run businesses predominantly in clothing, food, and retail sectors where control of a single firm is continually transferred from one generation to the next In terms of gender in Pakistan, a gap starts widening during primary education and persists throughout every sphere of life from government policy-making to household decision-making. In the lower house of parliament, for example, men have constituted nearly 80% of representatives. Most women do not work, and instead look after their families. Even after receiving medical degrees, for example, a majority of women leave the profession because of family pressure. Overall, the Labour Force Participation Rate for men is about 69%, while for women it is roughly 28%. More than half of women in rural areas, and about 40% in urban areas, earn less than PKR 5,000 (equivalent to about $40) per month. Meanwhile domestic violence continues to be a serious problem. In Punjab, the largest province by population, reported cases of violence rose to 7,678 in 2017, from 7,313 the prior year, despite extensive public awareness campaigns. Both the Maternal Mortality Rate and Infant Mortality Rate in the country have declined during the past decade, reflecting improvements in the provision of reproductive, maternal, and child health services. Fostering a growing awareness among women about ways to better protect their health, and access health facilities, could help bring these mortality rates closer to zero.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.105"
"4.821","“Securitization” and Rhetoric","","The “securitization” of migration, or the public discussion of migration issues strictly in security terms, rather than in economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian terms, has been fuelled by pivotal geopolitical events like the end of the Cold War and the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The more recent mass movements of Syrian refugees and other migrants to Europe escalated this trend, by more closely linking migration with terrorism in media coverage and on social media. These links, however, are being forged by far-right online activists without regard to accuracy or truth. Research published by Dublin City University in 2018 that analysed nearly 7.5 million tweets from 2015 and 2016, for example, found that during the large-scale migratory flows at that time to and through Europe there was a corresponding surge in far-right online activism. These activists used social media accounts to frame events in negative and racist ways, the research shows - and for the most part, they were successful in influencing the political debate in Europe, and in making it much harder for proportional, reasonable responses to the crisis to be enacted. A 2016 Pew Research Center survey found that a median of 59% of people in 10 European Union countries were concerned that an influx of refugees would increase the likelihood of terrorism - 76% felt this way in Hungary, and 71% in Poland. In Germany, where 61% of survey respondents expressed this view, a subsequent discussion paper published in 2017 by the IZA Institute of Labor Economics identified only very small increases in crime that had actually occurred in the wake of the heavy inflow of migrants and refugees in 2014 and 2015 - equal to about 1.5%. The increasing characterization of migration as a national security threat negatively affects public discourse, and is at odds with reality. Migration poses challenges but also comes with very significant benefits. Politicians (especially those in opposition parties) and far-right activists engaging in divisive campaigns that paint migrants as a criminal element are placing short term gain above longer-term social progress and prosperity. In the lead-up to the adoption of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration in late 2018, for example, far-right groups incorrectly stated that the agreement poses threats to national sovereignty. This sort of thing has been happening, in Europe and elsewhere, at a time of relative prosperity and peace. There is no global financial crisis, economic fundamentals are strong, diversity has never been greater, social cohesion is largely working - and peace (mostly) prevails, according to the Global Peace Index published by the Institute for Economics and Peace.","strategic-intelligence-sub-topics","1.98"
