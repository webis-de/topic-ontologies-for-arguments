"hc033","Obamacare will fail without tort reform: Malpractice insurance costs are crippling medicine BY DR. MICHAEL LAVYNE I am what you call a successful neurosurgeon, and I have nothing against ""socialized medicine"" as such. Everybody deserves good health care. But I am nonetheless worried about President Obama's health care reform, because without tort reform as part of the package, it can't address the labor shortage we face in my specialty. Tort reform is crucial because it would curtail the threat of frivolous malpractice lawsuits, reward all patients who have been injured by medical mishaps, not just the wealthy with access to high-powered lawyers - and reduce the anxieties faced by young doctors going into medicine in the first place, especially those entering high-stakes fields like my own. For example, I just operated on a 60-year old man who didn't even know his surgery was an emergency. He was losing motor function in his lower extremities due to severe spinal stenosis, and we were able to move quickly because we were free of insurance issues. But what if those insurance issues were paramount? What if somebody like me wasn't available, to anybody, because the supply of neurosurgeons had dried up - because the costs of letting them operate were too high? Would he still be walking? Good doctors have always been in short supply; why worry especially about neurosurgery? Only because spinal problems affect nearly 80% of our aging population: It's one of the most common reasons patients visit a primary care physician, right behind the yearly physical, the common cold, prenatal care and anxiety-related disorders. Baby boomers are about to overwhelm the system with demand for treatment of spinal problems - including surgery - at precisely the moment the supply of neurosurgeons able to treat them is dwindling. How could this have happened? How could we have a labor shortage in one of the most lucrative, prestigious and desperately needed medical specialties? One reason is the difficulty of getting certified, which makes sense. In May of 2009, the American Board of Neurological Surgeons certified 59 individuals as capable of tasks required of their specialty. But only about 30% of them, just 18 people, were ready to perform the surgeries that might solve the spinal problems of an aging population. The average age of these people was 37, they all carried loans from medical school and malpractice insurance premiums they faced were about $4.5 million a year if they settled in this state. Thus we come to the second reason: the cost of malpractice insurance, which creates a very high cost of entry into this field. Unfortunately, the health care reforms of the Obama administration have done little to curb costs. These costs are imposed by hospital inefficiencies as unpoliced by government-run insurance plans and by the price of malpractice insurance undisciplined by tort reform. I believe that tort reform is the key to reducing both kinds of cost, because the malignant threat of malpractice haunts the hospitals as well as the physicians. Without such reform, the choice for practicing neurosurgeons like me is between retirement and working 24/7 just to cover my insurance overhead. My premature retirement will reduce the supply of surgeons capable of dealing with the spinal problems of an aging population - and that supply is already short and getting shorter. Meanwhile, a few more board-certified surgeons a year won't meet the growing demand. The lines at your doctor's office could get long. When Congress returns to consider the problem of health care, it must understand that without tort reform, neurosurgery of the kind I can provide to an aging population will be unavailable. Lavyne is Clinical Professor of Neurological Surgery at Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University in New York City. ","upittsburgh-arguing-subjectivity"
"hc017","The bill that passed the Senate Thursday is a monstrosity. It is pock-marked with rotten pork added in backroom deals. If not fixed in conference committee, it could wind up costing New York a billion dollars a year. And it is a huge step forward for America. This legislation finally starts giving some basic protections to regular people who for years have been at the mercy of insurance companies. No more having coverage denied based on a preexisting condition or dropped when you get sick. It finally gives every citizen - 31 million more by nonpartisan calculations - the chance to buy health care coverage at an affordable rate, through newly created exchanges where people can pool their risk. It holds the promise of beginning to bend the health care ""cost curve"" that threatens to bankrupt the country as the baby boomers retire. Not enough - not even close - but every journey begins with a first step. Fully, 62% of all bankruptcies filed in 2007 were linked to medical expenses. Every day, in the world's wealthiest country, people lose everything because their bills, often from catastrophic illnesses, overwhelm them. Talk about adding insult to injury. Now, finally, there's some semblance of a safety net. In no way, shape or form, is this ""government-run"" health care, as critics insist. It is government-regulated care. That is something the people deserve in a nation where the government is entrusted to safeguard the safety of our air and drinking water and ensure fair play in major financial markets. Nor is this a loopy, liberal solution. The right-wing pundits hyperventilating that we're on the road to socialism need to check themselves into the hospital and get hooked up to an oxygen machine. This is a moderate, though comprehensive, attempt to fix a huge problem - to adjust a system that's simply unsustainable in its current form. In broad outlines, the bill is a national version of the imperfect but important reform plan that Republican Governor Mitt Romney signed into law in Massachusetts years ago. It's light years less liberal than HillaryCare was. Let it not be lost on critics that President Obama demanded that the bill be ""paid for"" - in other words, that all the taxes and cuts necessary to fund it be included in the legislation. President George W. Bush never felt this pang of responsibility when, for instance, he championed the new prescription drug benefit in Medicare - and that's why Sen. John McCain and other budget hawks opposed it. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says the bill would reduce the federal deficit by $132 billion over its first 10 years and as much as $1.3 trillion in the following decade. Prepare for a rough road ahead. The legislation could emerge from the House-Senate conference as something that either the liberals in the House or the moderates in the Senate can't swallow. On abortion alone, threading the needle will mean drawing blood. If and when this thing passes, the headaches of getting it through Congress will be nothing compared to the migraine-sized hangover of implementing something this complicated. But guess what? Fixing big problems is complicated. It's also why we sent these people to Washington. ","upittsburgh-arguing-subjectivity"
"hc041","ObamaCare & kids: Under the bus Saturday, September 25, 2010 Here's how ObamaCare is ""helping"" California, Colorado, Ohio and Missouri families: As of Thursday, they paid more for coverage. That's when ObamaCare's provision that forbids insurers from turning away children with pre-existing conditions took effect, prompting insurers WellPoint and CoventryOne to stop offering children-only coverage in those states. That means parents who've been paying less for separate children's coverage than they would have for family coverage will be paying more. The insurers' actions are understandable because this ObamaCare provision allows families to delay buying health insurance until children get sick -- a situation that at best hikes costs for everyone. It's another unintended consequence that shows just how empty ObamaCare's bottom-line promises really are. Cries of outrage from liberal groups such as Health Care for America Now -- which calls these insurers' moves ""immoral"" and ""patently dishonest"" violations of the ObamaCare law -- are the whining of those who misguidedly see a government takeover of health care as a good thing. Most Americans rightly don't -- and as of Thursday, California, Colorado, Ohio and Missouri families who have to pay more for coverage have swollen their ranks. ","upittsburgh-arguing-subjectivity"
"hc094","House Republicans plan to repeal health care reform, but have yet to offer specific alternative Posted By Adrienne Verrilli 01/17/2011, in Activism, Health Care, with 0 Comments 0 inShare This week, House Republicans will move forward with their efforts to pass HR 2, the �Repealing the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act� which effectively repeals the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act, aka health care reform. HR 2, expected to pass the House by a wide-margin, is dead on arrival in the Democratically-controlled Senate and would never be signed into law by the President. So the question is � to what end? The move to undo the Affordable Health Care Act makes for great political theater and is a hunk of red meat to the Tea Party. It will also certainly be considered by the Beltway insiders and cable television pundits to be a political win for Republicans. However, will this symbolic vote actually force the Republicans to defend what repealing the Affordable Health Care Act means for the county? No one can be sure. What we do know is that if actual repeal did in fact happen, the following is what it would mean for the American people. First, budget deficits will increase, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The Republicans found a renewed concern for the federal budget deficit the day President Obama took office and have charged that the country cannot afford to ensure that all Americans have health insurance. However, the CBO found that HR 2 will actually increase budget deficits approximately $230 billion by 2021. House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) dismissed the CBO estimate saying that �I do not believe that repealing the job- killing health care law will increase the deficit.� Second, popular provisions already in effect would be undone. A number of provisions that are currently in effect are: � Young people can stay on their parent�s health insurance plan until age 26. � Preventative care such as vaccines, mammograms, blood pressure screenings, pap tests, colonoscopies among others are free, i.e. no longer subject to co-pays or deductibles. � Health insurance companies can no longer deny children coverage because of a pre-existing condition. � Health insurance companies can no longer kick someone off their insurance plan if they get sick. � Seniors who reach the Medicare Part D donut hole are eligible for a 50% discount on all prescription drugs. � Preventative health care for seniors such as annual wellness exams are free. � Health insurance companies can no longer put a cap on how much they will pay in medical care for a person over his or her lifetime. � Health insurance companies can no longer charge women more for their health insurance than they do men. � Small businesses are eligible for tax credits if they offer health insurance coverage to their employees [80 percent of California�s small businesses are eligible.] � People who have been denied health insurance for having a pre-existing condition can now purchase health insurance from the Pre-Existing Condition Health Plan. � For health insurers, 85% of employee plans� premiums and 80% of individual plans� premiums must be spent on medical care as compared to health insurance companies� administrative costs, including CEO salaries. And, beginning in 2014: � Health insurance companies can no longer deny a person health insurance because of a pre-existing condition. � All uninsured people will be able to purchase private health insurance from their state�s health insurance exchange � a pool of private insurance plans available for purchase. [California was the first state to set up its exchange] � Increase the small business tax credit for offering health insurance to their employees. Finally, any repeal would leave millions uninsured. The CBO report also estimated that the repeal of the Affordable Health Care Act will leave 54 million nonelderly people uninsured. Yet, the Republicans have not offered an alternative plan to cover any of these people. Tags: lake, tea party","upittsburgh-arguing-subjectivity"

"gayRights-G19","It's arbitrary because all I have to do is change the law to suite my preference. Which by the way is something that is actively being done with the age of consent.   Preference and the ability to consent aren't inclusive. That, for example, the age of consent might be lowered or raised has no bearing on the legal definition of consent.   The law used to say one thing and now that definition is being broadened to suite more peoples personal preferences   The law has only broadened which  consenting parties  can be married, the issue of express consent would still need to be addressed if your slippery slope is to be accepted.   If we stretch the legal definition of marriage to cover a groups preference what's to stop another group from demanding that it be stretched to cover their preference?   As long as there are two expressly consenting parties, then nothing should stop us from allowing other people to get married. An animal can't consent. And despite your efforts below to show that your cat can, it's  you  who's saying it's consenting, not the cat itself. You can't consent on behalf of another unless that  legal  entity legally acquiesces to your authority to do so.   Were it ends then becomes an arbitrary standard. And if you don't set one, the thing gets so stretched that it hardly resembles what it first look liked.

"abortion-P29","I'm not for making abortion illegal, but I am for legislation to discourage medical professionals from performing unnecessary medical procedures on pregnant women that result in the death of the developing fetus. So I will argue for Silaswash...since I guess he bailed.   people (the mother) should have the right to self determination when no other moral agent will be harmed by such actions.   It could be argued that it harms the public in general, by  1. Wasting valuable medical resources on unnecessary procedures  2. Encouraging indiscriminate sex  3. Promoting a culture of irresponsibility  It could mentally harm a father who had no choice but to bear the thought of his offspring being killed in it's most vulnerable state before it even had a chance.   fetuses do not gain moral agency until the onset of the third trimester (the point when basic brain activity and consciousness is possible).   Moral agency! people don't get moral agency until they are old enough to experience regret. People who don't yet have moral agency still deserve legal protection.   The reason why this point is the moment of moral agency is because moral agency can only be justifiably attributed to value attributing agents.   So how would you say a developing baby at the onset of the third trimester all of the sudden starts attributing value? Desperate attempts to justify the unnecessary killing of a fetus are invariably the result of such poor stretches of logic.   Because, prior to this, the fetus is not an agent, morality doesnt apply, the fetus has no sovereignty since sovereignty is determined by the awareness of self.    Morality applies any time an ugly and regrettable thing like an unnecessary abortion is performed.   The issue of abortion is not properly about the fetus (unless you are arguing about the 3rd trimester, which no one is), it is properly about the rights of the mother since she is the only person who has any justified claim to sovereignty of her body.   So when do the father's rights to protect his developing child kick in?","utdallas-ideological-debates-reasons"
"essay216","The population explosion results in the high demands of transportation. Many countries have suffered from pollution, noisy and casualty for a long time. From my perspective, the most possible solution to these problems is improving roads and highways because of three crucial reasons. First and foremost, we all know that upgrading public transportation will surely aggravate the pollution and accidents. The buses, cars and trains regularly emit a noxious gas which causes lots of fatal diseases such as lung cancer and pneumonia. Moreover, the sound emanates from the engines can worsen our hearing. Most importantly, there are many accidents happening on the roads. For example, in my country, buses are attributed to the cause of skyrocketing of accidents. Each year, Vietnam has approximately twelve thousand people die of accidents which is equivalent to the death toll of the tsunami in Japan. Secondly, investing in roads and highways can broaden the area and allow more public transportation to work. Not only buses but also other personal vehicles can move easily on the roads. For instance, I always leave school at the time that everybody rushes into the roads and hastily goes home. It is extremely troublesome for me to escape from the crowd on the roads in only one hour. In contrast, if the roads are enlarged, everyone can go home in short time and there are hardly any collisions. Last but not least, spending on renovating the highways and roads can improve the quality. All of us are afraid of moving on the rough roads with lots of portholes. Those bad conditions result in many terrible accidents and make several people feel worried. We should not accuse the drivers of causing accidents because a part of the responsibility belongs to the authorities. What's more, a smooth surface makes the transportation and movement become safer and easier. In a nutshell, the advantages of upgrading the roads which I mentioned above are totally convincing and indispensable. I am usually inclined to this idea and I hope that the government will regard the investment in building roads as the most important thing.","ukp-argument-annotated-essays-v2"
"essay284","When we watch movies or dramas, some of us like to see good people have a good ending and bad people are punished. While there are also some people who do not like this. Personally, I prefer to see good people get rewarded. However, if the good people always get an happy ending, I don’t think it’s proper. First, if all the story end up in the same way, it will be boring. If good people always win, we can guess the ending of the movies or dramas. Then we will feel less interested in them. But if the good people are not always rewarded, we will try to finish the movie or dramas to find out the end of the story. For example, Hollywood stories usually have a happy ending like a hero beats a crime and get a girl. But now many people, including me, have been tired with it. I don’t want to see the same kind of ending again and again. So we can’t always let good people be rewarded in movies or TV programs. Even in the real world, good people can get a bad ending sometimes. And I think it happen more often in the real world than in those movies. So if children always watch the TV programs that good people get rewarded, they may think it will be true in the real world. They will be misleading by those movies. And they may act like good people in order to get reward. Once they find the good people are not always get rewarded, they may feel upset and not to be a good person. But in fact, the good people do good things no matter the ending is good or not. So we should tell this to the young children to avoid the misunderstanding. In fact, those good endings sometimes are helpful. Some people may be encouraged to do good things. But like I said, this kind of behavior won’t last long, because someday they will realize the truth. So I suggest we should show people the truth in the stories. And if they can, they will be good people no matter how the story ends. Based on my arguments above, I think movies and TV programs should present different stories in which good people get reward or get nothing.","ukp-argument-annotated-essays-v2"
"essay225","I agree with the statement that childhood is the happiest period of one's life. It's not only the lack of responsibilities and daily struggle that make childhood the happiest time of our lives, but also factors like learning lots of new things every day and freedom to imagine and say what you think. Starting with our adulthood, we are strictly bounded with our responsibilities in our daily lives. We are told at what hour we shall wake up, how we shall dress up and how we shall behave. Every action we make are watched closely and judged by the community. But during our childhood, though responsibilies exist, we are much more free to do what we would like to. Being late for school or laughing at a place where you aren't supposed to do not have consequences as serious as that would be if you were an adult. Another great thing about being a child is possibility learning new and interesting things about the world you live in every single day. Being a child means that you are new in this world and every single thing around you is there to be discovered by you. There are lots of new facts you can learn, stories you can listen to and things you can see. Therefore, childhood is the period of time in which a person is surprised most. Using your imagination and saying what you think freely is another great thing about being a child. Children are not judged about the things they say as much as the adults, and freedom to express yourself is a very important for developing a colorful imagination. In adulthood, people are forced to express themselves in boundaries, therefore they are in no way free to think or use their imagination. Childhood, in several aspects, is the happiest period of our lives. It's not only because of the nature of childhood and children, but also the way our lives are changed when we are adults. In an ideal world with less boundaries, social judgement and more freedom of thought, things could be different; but since this is not the case, it seems that we will always be missing our childhood days.","ukp-argument-annotated-essays-v2"
"essay376","There has always been a saying in medicine: ""Prevention is better than cure"". This statement has raised a question whether the government should allocate a large sum out of the national health budget to educating and phasing in health-protected measures. In my opinion, this plan should be put into practice for the two reasons mentioned accordingly. No one can argue the importance to include health lessons in school programmes, especially at primary level, in the hope of raising people's awareness. Children should be taught about balanced diets, nutritious food as well as harmful ones, thereby they will have a fundamental grasp of how to lead a healthy lifestyle. What is more, it is much easier for people at early ages to form a habit of, for instance, not consuming too much fast food, over-fried food or intoxicants. In addition, it will be of economic benefit to pre-empt certain kinds of diseases. Needless to say, such unpreventable illnesses as cancer or HIV will cost the victim a fortune, not to cure, but to lengthen his longevity for 1 or 2 more years. Similarly, if humans tend to keep fit more regularly by participating in outdoor activities or using health-care product, obesity, myopia or other diseases that require expensive treatments will never stand a chance. To sum up, I have to concede to the materialistic diversion from treatment to health education and preventative measures. This will yield positive results on not only the people's physical and mental development but also their finance.","ukp-argument-annotated-essays-v2"
"617","East Germany conducted a decades long program to feed performance-enhancing drugs to their athletes. The drug regimes, given either with or without the knowledge of the athletes, resulted in victories in international competitions, including the Olympics.   Systematic doping of athletes ended with the fall of communism in East Germany in 1989, before German reunification a year later. Many former athletes suffer from health problems related to steroid consumption.  East Germany closed itself to the sporting world in May 1965 [REF]. In 1977 the shot-putter Ilona Slupianek, who weighed 93&nbsp;kg - tested positive for anabolic steroids at the European Cup meeting in Helsinki and thereafter athletes were tested before they left the country. At the same time, the Kreischa testing laboratory near Dresden passed into government control, which was reputed to make around 12,000 tests a year on East German athletes but without any being penalised [REF].   The International Amateur Athletics Federation suspended Slupianek for 12 months, a penalty that ended two days before the European championships in Prague. In the reverse of what the IAAF hoped, sending her home to East Germany meant she was free to train unchecked with anabolic steroids, if she wanted to, and then compete for another gold medal. Which indeed she won.   After that, almost nothing emerged from the East German sports schools and laboratories. A rare exception was the visit by the sports writer and former athlete, Doug Gilbert of the Edmonton Sun, who said: .   Dr (Heinz) Wuschech knows more about anabolic steroids than any doctor I have ever met, and yet he cannot discuss them openly any more than Geoff Capes or Mac Wilkins can openly discuss them in the current climate of amateur sports regulation. What I did learn in East Germany was that they feel there is little danger from anabolica, as they call it, when the athletes are kept on strictly monitored programmes. Although the extremely dangerous side-effects are admitted, they are statistically no more likely to occur than side-effects from the birth control pill. If, that is, programmes are constantly medically monitored as to dosage [REF].   Other reports came from the occasional athlete who fled to the West. There were 15 between 1976 and 1979. One, the ski-jumper Hans Georg Aschenbach, said: ""Long-distance skiers start having injections to their knees from the age 14 because of their intensive training.""[REF] He said: ""For every Olympic champion, there at least 350 invalids. There are gymnasts among the girls who have to wear corsets from the age of 18 because their spine and their ligaments have become so worn.. There are young people so worn out by the intensive training that they come out of it mentally blank [lessivés - washed out], which is even more painful than a deformed spine.""[REF] .   Then on 26 August 1993, after the former GDR had disbanded itself to accede to the Federal Republic of Germany in 1990, the records were opened and the evidence was there that the Stasi, the GDR state secret police, supervised systematic doping of East German athletes from 1971 until reunification in 1990. Doping existed in other countries, says expert Jean-Pierre de Mondenard, both communist and capitalist, but the difference with East Germany was that it was a state policy [REF].   The Sportvereinigung Dynamo (English:Sport Club Dynamo)[REF] was especially singled out as a center for doping in the former East Germany [REF]. Many former club officials and some athletes found themselves charged after the dissolution of the country. A special page on the internet was created by doping victims trying to gain justice and compensation, listing people involved in doping in the GDR [REF].   State-endorsed doping began with the Cold War when every eastern bloc gold was an ideological victory. From 1974, Manfred Ewald, the head of the GDR's sports federation, imposed blanket doping. At the 1968 Mexico City Olympics, the country of 17 million collected nine gold medals. Four years later the total was 20 and in 1976 it doubled again to 40 [REF]. Ewald was quoted as having told coaches, ""They're still so young and don't have to know everything."" He was given a 22-month suspended sentence, to the outrage of his victims [REF].   Often, doping was carried out without the knowledge of the athletes, some of them as young as ten years of age. It is estimated that around 10,000 former athletes bear the physical and mental scars of years of drug abuse,[REF] one of them is Rica Reinisch, a triple Olympic champion and world record-setter at the Moscow Games in 1980, has since suffered numerous miscarriages and recurring ovarian cysts.   Two former Dynamo Berlin club doctors, Dieter Binus, chief of the national women's team from 1976 to 80, and Bernd Pansold, in charge of the sports medicine centre in East-Berlin, were committed for trial for allegedly supplying 19 teenagers with illegal substances [REF]. Binus was sentenced in August,[REF] Pansold in December 1998 after both being found guilty of administering hormones to underage female athletes from 1975 to 1984 [REF].   Virtually no East German athlete ever failed an official drugs test, though Stasi files show that many did, indeed, produce positive tests at Kreischa, the Saxon laboratory (German:Zentrales Dopingkontroll-Labor des Sportmedizinischen Dienstes) that was at the time approved by the International Olympic Committee,[REF] now called the Institute of Doping Analysis and Sports Biochemistry (IDAS) [REF].   In 2005, fifteen years after the end of the GDR, the manufacturer of the drugs in former East Germany, Jenapharm, still finds itself involved in numerous lawsuits from doping victims, being sued by almost 200 former athletes [REF].   Former Sport Club Dynamo athletes who publicly admitted to doping, accusing their coaches[REF]: .   Daniela Hunger Andrea Pollack .   Former Sport Club Dynamo athletes disqualified for doping: .   Ilona Slupianek[REF] (Ilona Slupianek was tested positive along with three Finnish athletes at the 1977 European Cup, becoming the only East German athlete ever to be convicted of doping) .   Based on the admission by Pollack, the United States Olympic Committee asked for the redistribution of gold medals won in the 1976 Summer Olympics [REF]. Despite court rulings in Germany that substantiate claims of systematic doping by some East German swimmers, the IOC executive board announced that it has no intention of revising the Olympic record books. In rejecting the American petition on behalf of its women's medley relay team in Montreal and a similar petition from the British Olympic Association on behalf of Sharron Davies, the IOC made it clear that it wanted to discourage any such appeals in the future [REF].  In 1991 Brigitte Berendonk and Werner Franke, two opponents of the doping, published several theses which had been drafted former researchers in the GDR doping products which were at the Military Medical Academy Bad Saarow. Based on this work, in their book (translated from German as 'Doping Documents"") they were able to reconstruct the practice of doping as it was organized by the State on many great athletes from the GDR, including Marita Koch and Heike Drechsler‎, who have denied the allegations. Brigitte Berendonk survived a 1993 lawsuit where Drechsler‎ accused her of lying. The lawsuit essentially validates the book[REF][REF] .  In 1977, one of East Germany's best sprinters, Renate Neufeld, fled to the West with the Bulgarian she later married. A year later she said that she had been told to take drugs supplied by coaches while training to represent East Germany in the 1980 Olympic Games.   At 17, I joined the East Berlin Sports Institute. My speciality was the 80m hurdles. We swore that we would never speak to anyone about our training methods, including our parents. The training was very hard. We were all watched. We signed a register each time we left for dormitory and we had to say where we were going and what time we would return. One day, my trainer, Günter Clam, advised me to take pills to improve my performance: I was running 200m in 24 seconds. My trainer told me the pills were vitamins, but I soon had cramp in my legs, my voice became gruff and sometimes I couldn't talk any more. Then I started to grow a moustache and my periods stopped. I then refused to take these pills. One morning in October 1977, the secret police took me at 7am and questioned me about my refusal to take pills prescribed by the trainer. I then decided to flee, with my fiancé [REF].   She brought with her to the West grey tablets and green powder she said had been given to her, to members of her club, and to other athletes. The West German doping analyst Manfred Donike reportedly identified them as anabolic steroids. She said she stayed quiet for a year for the sake of her family. But when her father then lost his job and her sister was expelled from her handball club, she decided to tell her story [REF].  Heidi Krieger competed in the East German athletics team, winning the gold medal for shot put in the 1986 European Championships in Athletics.   From the age of 16 onward, Krieger was systematically doped with anabolic steroids, which have significant androgenic effects on the body. She had already had doubts about her sexuality, and the chemical changes resulting from the steroids only exacerbated them. Eventually, she had many of the characteristics of a man. In 1997, some years after retirement, Krieger underwent sex reassignment surgery and changed her name to Andreas.

Reforestation can be used to improve the quality of human life by soaking up pollution and dust from the air, rebuild natural habitats and ecosystems, mitigate global warming since forests facilitate biosequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide, and harvest for resources, particularly timber.   The term reforestation is similar to afforestation, the process of restoring and recreating areas of woodlands or forests that may have existed long ago but were deforested or otherwise removed at some point in the past. Sometimes the term re-afforestation is used to distinguish between the original forest cover and the later re-growth of forest to an area. Special tools, e.g. tree planting bar, are used to make planting of trees easier and faster.  Reforestation of large areas can be done through the use of measuring rope (for accurate plant spacing) and ribbeds, (or wheeled augers for planting the larger trees) for making the hole in which a seedling or plant can be inserted. Indigenous soil inoculants (e.g., Zaccaria bi color) can optionally be used to increase survival rates in hardy environments.   A debatable issue in managed reforestation is whether or not the succeeding forest will have the same biodiversity as the original forest. If the forest is replaced with only one species of tree and all other vegetation is prevented from growing back, a monoculture forest similar to agricultural crops would be the result. However, most reforestation involves the planting of different feedlots of seedlings taken from the area often of multiple species. Another important factor is the natural regeneration of a wide variety of plant and animal species that can occur on a clear cut. In some areas the suppression of forest fires for hundreds of years has resulted in large single aged and single species forest stands. The logging of small clear cuts and or prescribed burning, actually increases the biodiversity in these areas by creating a greater variety of tree stand ages and species.  Reforestation need not be only used for recovery of accidentally destroyed forests. In some countries, such as Finland, the forests are managed by the wood products and pulp and paper industry. In such an arrangement, like other crops, trees are replanted wherever they are cut. In such circumstances, the industry can cut the trees in a way to allow easier reforestation. The wood products industry systematically replaces many of the trees it cuts, employing large numbers of summer workers for tree planting work. For example, in 2010, Weyerhaeuser reported planting 50 million seedlings [REF].   In just 20 years, a teak plantation in Costa Rica can produce up to about 400 m of wood per hectare. As the natural teak forests of Asia become more scarce or difficult to obtain, the prices commanded by plantation-grown teak grow higher every year. Other species such as mahogany grow slower than teak in Tropical America but are also extremely valuable. Faster growers include pine, eucalyptus, and Gmelina.   Reforestation, if several native species are used, can provide other benefits in addition to financial returns, including restoration of the soil, rejuvenation of local flora and fauna, and the capturing and sequestering of 38 tons of carbon dioxide per hectare per year.   The reestablishment of forests is not just simple tree planting. Forests are made up of a diversity of species and they build dead organic matter into soils over time. A major tree-planting program in a place like this would enhance the local climate and reduce the demands of burning large amounts of fossil fuels for cooling in the summer [REF].  Forests are an important part of the global carbon cycle because trees and plants absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. By removing this greenhouse gas from the air, forests function as terrestrial carbon sinks, meaning they store large amounts of carbon. At any time, forests account for as much as double the amount of carbon in the atmosphere [REF]. Even as more anthropogenic carbon is produced, forests remove around three billion tons of anthropogenic carbon every year. This amounts to about 30% of all carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels. Therefore, an increase in the overall forest cover around the world would tend to mitigate global warming.   There are four major strategies available to mitigate carbon emissions through forestry activities: increase the amount of forested land through a reforestation process; increase the carbon density of existing forests at a stand and landscape scale; expand the use of forest products that will sustainably replace fossil-fuel emissions; and reduce carbon emissions that are caused from deforestation and degradation [REF].   Achieving the first strategy would require enormous and wide-ranging efforts. However, there are many organizations around the world that encourage tree-planting as a way to offset carbon emissions for the express purpose of fighting climate change. For example, in China, the Jane Goodall Institute, through their Shanghai Roots & Shoots division, launched the Million Tree Project in Kulun Qi, Inner Mongolia to plant one million trees to stop desertification and help curb climate change [REF]. China has used 24 billion metres squared of new forest plantation and natural forest regrowth to offset 21% of Chinese fossil fuel emissions in 2000[REF]. In Java, Indonesia each newlywed couple is to give whoever is sermonizing their wedding 5 seedlings to combat global warming. Each couple that wishes to have a divorce has to give 25 seedlings to whoever divorces them [REF].   The second stategy has to do with selecting species for tree-planting. In theory, planting any kind of tree to produce more forest cover would absorb more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. On the other hand, a genetically modified tree specimen might grow much faster than any other regular tree [REF]. Some of these trees are already being developed in the lumber and biofuel industries. These fast-growing trees would not only be planted for those industries but they can also be planted to help absorb carbon dioxide faster than slow-growing trees [REF].   Extensive forest resources placed anywhere in the world will not always have a the same impact. For example, large reforestation programs in boreal or subarctic regions have a limited impact on climate mitigation. This is because it substitutes a bright snow-dominated region that reflects the sunlight with dark forest canopies. A study from the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, USA, found that trees in temperate latitudes have a net warming effect on the atmosphere. The heat that dark leaves release without absorbing outweighs the carbon they sequester [REF]. On the other hand, a positive example would be reforestation projects in tropical regions, which would lead to a positive biophysical change such as the formation of clouds. These clouds would then reflect the sunlight, creating a positive impact on climate mitigation [REF].   There is an advantage to planting trees in tropical climates with wet seasons. In such a setting, trees have a quicker growth rate because they can grow year-round. Trees in tropical climates have, on average, larger, brighter, and more abundant leaves than non-tropical climates. A study of the girth of 70,000 trees across Africa has shown that tropical forests are soaking up more carbon dioxide pollution than previously realized. The research suggests almost one fifth of fossil fuel emissions are absorbed by forests across Africa, Amazonia and Asia. Simon Lewis, a climate expert at the University of Leeds, who led the study, said: ""Tropical forest trees are absorbing about 18% of the carbon dioxide added to the atmosphere each year from burning fossil fuels, substantially buffering the rate of change.""[REF] .   It is also important to deal with the rate of deforestation. At this point, there are 13 billion metres squared of tropical regions that are deforested every year. There is potential for these regions to reduce rates of deforestation by 50% by 2050, which would be a huge contribution to stabilize the global climate [REF].  Some incentives for reforestation can be as simple as a financial compensation. Streck and Scholz (2006) explain how a group of scientists from various institutions have developed a compensated reduction of deforestation approach which would reward developing countries that disrupt any further act of deforestation. Countries that participate and take the option to reduce their emissions from deforestation during a committed period of time would receive financial compensation for the carbon dioxide emissions that they avoided [REF]. To raise the payments, the host country would issue government bonds or negotiate some kind of loan with a financial institution that would want to take part in the compensation promised to the other country. The funds received by the country could be invested to help find alternatives to the extensive cutdown of forests. This whole process of cutting emissions would be voluntary, but once the country has agreed to lower their emissions they would be obligated to reduce their emissions. However, if a country was not able to meet their obligation, their target would get added to their next commitment period. The authors of these proposals see this as a solely government-to-government agreement; private entities would not participate in the compensation trades [REF].  In Germany, reforestation is required as part of the federal forest law. 31% of Germany is forested, according to the second forest inventory of 2001–2003. The size of the forest area in Germany increased between the first and the second forest inventory due to forestation of degenerated bogs and agricultural areas [REF].  Reforestation competes with other land uses such as food production, livestock grazing, and living space for further economic growth.   There is also the risk that through a forest fire or insect outbreak much of the stored carbon in a reforested area could make its way back to the atmosphere [REF]. Reduced harvesting rates and fire suppression have caused an increase in the forest biomass in the western United States over the past century. This causes an increase of about a factor of four in the frequency of fires due to longer and hotter dry seasons [REF].","ibm-debater-claim-evidence-emnlp"
"2038","Cultural competence refers to an ability to interact effectively with people of different cultures, particularly in the context of human resources, non-profit organizations, and government agencies whose employees work with persons from different cultural/ethnic backgrounds.   Cultural competence comprises four components: (a) Awareness of one's own cultural worldview, (b) Attitude towards cultural differences, (c) Knowledge of different cultural practices and worldviews, and (d) cross-cultural skills. Developing cultural competence results in an ability to understand, communicate with, and effectively interact with people across cultures [REF].  To understand cultural competence, it is important to grasp the full meaning of the word ""culture"" first. According to Chamberlain (2005), culture represents ""the values, norms, and traditions that affect how individuals of a particular group perceive, think, interact, behave, and make judgments about their world"" (p.&nbsp;197). Taylor (1996) defined culture as, ""an integrated pattern of human behavior including thought, communication, ways of interacting, roles and relationships, and expected behaviors, beliefs, values,practices and customs."" Nine-Curt (1984) qualified culture as, ""The bearer of human wisdom that includes a wealth of human behaviors, beliefs, attitudes, values and experiences of immense worth. It also carries things that are offensive to a person's dignity and well being, and certainly to others whose cultural framework is different."" .   Cultural competence may also be associated with diversity and from an organizational communication perspective, a diverse culture. Diversity must be prevalent and valued before one may be considered culturally competent or diversity competent organization. The term diversity has evolved to include concepts focusing on organizational culture and the intersections of power, structure, and communication[REF] all of which may contribute to diversity initiatives or potentially impede them. Diversity initiatives are typically part of a more human resources management approach which not only seeks employee input but also values it; differences are recognized as a uniting component rather than a separating one [REF]. Since diversity is an ambiguous term grounded in context, it does not necessarily mean the same thing to all the people all the time. Diversity encourages the process of including the perspectives of under-represented, non-dominant groups in organizations to ensure they have a voice (Orbe & Spellers, 2005); however, Von Bergen, Soper, & Foster(2002)[REF] argue that the dominant group must also be part of the diversity initiative or an “us versus them” mentality becomes entrenched in the organization impeding the effectiveness of any diversity initiative, thereby delegitimizing it.   While a few individuals seem to be born with cultural competence, the rest of us have had to put considerable effort into developing it. This means examining our biases and prejudices, developing cross-cultural skills, searching for role models, and spending as much time as possible with other people who share a passion for cultural competence.  The term multicultural competence surfaced in a mental health publication by psychologist Paul Pedersen (1988) at least a decade before the term cultural competence became popular. Most of the definitions of cultural competence shared among diversity professionals come from the healthcare industry. Their perspective is useful in the broader context of diversity work.   Consider the following definitions:  A set of congruent behaviors, attitudes and policies that come together as a system, agency or among professionals and enable that system, agency or those professionals to work effectively in cross-cultural situations.   Cultural competence requires that organizations have a defined set of values and principles, and demonstrate behaviors, attitudes, policies, and structures that enable them to work effectively cross-culturally.   Cultural competence is defined simply as the level of knowledge-based skills required to provide effective clinical care to patients from a particular ethnic or racial group.   Cultural competence is a developmental process that evolves over an extended period. Both individuals and organizations are at various levels of awareness, knowledge and skills along the cultural competence continuum.   It is not surprising that the healthcare profession was the first to promote cultural competence. A poor diagnosis due to lack of cultural understanding, for example, can have fatal consequences, especially in medical service delivery. Cultural incompetence in the business community can damage an individual’s self esteem and career, but the unobservable psychological impact on the victims can go largely unnoticed until the threat of a class action suit brings them to light.   Notice that some definitions emphasize the knowledge and skills needed to interact with people of different cultures, while others focus on attitudes. A few definitions attribute cultural competence or a lack thereof to policies and organizations. It’s easy to see how working with terms that vary in definition can be tricky.   Can you even measure something like cultural competence? In an attempt to offer solutions for developing cultural competence, Diversity Training University International (DTUI) isolated four cognitive components: (a) Awareness, (b) Attitude, (c) Knowledge, and (d) Skills.   Awareness. Awareness is consciousness of one's personal reactions to people who are different. A police officer who recognizes that he profiles people who look like they are from Mexico as ""illegal aliens"" has cultural awareness of his reactions to this group of people.   Attitude. Paul Pedersen’s multicultural competence model emphasized three components: awareness, knowledge and skills. DTUI added the attitude component in order to emphasize the difference between training that increases awareness of cultural bias and beliefs in general and training that has participants carefully examine their own beliefs and values about cultural differences.   Knowledge. Social science research indicates that our values and beliefs about equality may be inconsistent with our behaviors, and we ironically may be unaware of it. Social psychologist Patricia Devine and her colleagues, for example, showed in their research that many people who score low on a prejudice test tend to do things in cross cultural encounters that exemplify prejudice (e.g., using out-dated labels such as ""illegal aliens"" or ""colored"".). This makes the Knowledge component an important part of cultural competence development.   Regardless of whether our attitude towards cultural differences matches our behaviors, we can all benefit by improving our cross-cultural effectiveness. One common goal of diversity professionals is to create inclusive systems that allow members to work at maximum productivity levels.   Skills. The Skills component focuses on practicing cultural competence to perfection. Communication is the fundamental tool by which people interact in organizations. This includes gestures and other non-verbal communication that tend to vary from culture to culture.   Notice that the set of four components of our cultural competence definition—awareness, attitude, knowledge, and skills— represents the key features of each of the popular definitions. The utility of the definition goes beyond the simple integration of previous definitions, however. It is the diagnostic and intervention development benefits that make the approach most appealing.   Cultural competence is becoming increasingly necessary for work, home, community social lives.   Reprint by permission. Reference: Mercedes Martin & Billy E. Vaughn (2007).

Cambridge, Massachusetts.  The United States in its earliest history had a culture influenced heavily by its Northern European population, primarily from the British Isles, who originally settled in the original British Colonies. While the indigenous peoples, known as Indians, were the largest population of North America, they were slowly pushed away from the Eastern Seaboard into the interior of North America during the 17th century, 18th century, and 19th century (see Indian Removal Act describing specific actions during early 19th century). During this period, people from the British Isles (England and Scotland primarily) brought the culture and religion of the British Isles with them to the United States and became the dominant political and cultural group along the Eastern Seaboard of North America.   Both voluntary immigration from other regions as well as the results of the Atlantic slave trade, brought a mix of people to the Americas, including Europeans, Africans, and, to a lesser extent until the 20th century, Asians. Thus began the process of diversifying the population of the Western Hemisphere. While the majority of the U.S. population were white immigrants from northern and western Europe and their descendants, they maintained most of the power, social and economic, of the nation.   In the U.S. context, immigration from the 1840s onward diversified the ethnic composition of the nation. During the early part of the 20th century, southern and eastern European immigrants and their descendants became a larger percentage of the population, but as recent immigrants concentrated in urban areas were also very often poor and lacking in basic healthy living and working conditions. Descendants of African slaves and immigrants faced a much more difficult challenge due to their skin color and discrimination enforced by legal systems, such as the Jim Crow laws in the United States. Since the 1960s, African Americans as well as other minority groups such as Mexican Americans have gained greater social and economic status and power.   Nonetheless, the dominant models of education and social services retained models developed by northern and western European intellectuals, even such well-meaning and important reformers as Jane Addams and Jacob Riis. After the Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, though, social workers, activists, and even some healthcare providers began to examine their practices to see if they were as effective in African American, Latino, and even Asian American communities in the U.S. The arrival of more than half a million Southeast Asian refugees, from 1975 to 1992, for example, tested the ability of medical and social workers to continue effective practice among speakers of other languages and among those coming from very different understandings of everything from mental health to charity.  With the larger population of minorities and racial integration during the 1960s and 1970s, the public school system of the United States had to grapple with issues of cultural sensitivity as most teachers in public school system came from white, middle class backgrounds. Most of these teachers were educated, primarily English speaking, and primarily from the Western European cultures. They often had trouble trying to communicate with speakers of limited English proficiency, let alone people of vastly different value systems and normative behaviors from that of Anglo-European culture. The purpose of training educators and others in the area of cultural competence is to provide new teachers the background and skills to work effectively with children of all backgrounds and social classes.   With the growing diversity of the student body in U.S. public school, it is increasingly imperative that teachers have and continually develop a cultural competence that enables them to connect with, respond to, and interact effectively with their pupils. The achievement gap between cultural minority and majority students suggests that some sort of communication disconnect often occurs in minority classrooms because cultural mismatch between teachers and students is common and should not prevent positive, productive for both parties, provided the educator is a culturally competent communicator. Over the last few decades, scholars have increasingly shown interest in the relationship between learning, reading, schema, and culture. People’s schema depends on their social location, which, as Anderson (1984) explains, includes a reader’s age, sex, race, religion, nationality, and occupation, amongst other factors. Considering schemata determine how people understand, interpret, and analyze everything in their world, it is clear that background and experience really do affect the learning and teaching processes, and how each should be approached in context. ""In short,"" Anderson (1984) says, ""the schema that will be brought to bear on a text depends upon the reader’s culture"" (p.&nbsp;374-375). More simply, Anderson (1984) describes a person’s schema as their ""organized knowledge about the world"" (p.&nbsp;372). In considering the role of schema, one of the educator’s principal functions in teaching, particularly with literacy, is to ""‘bridge the gap between what the learner already knows and what he needs to know before he can successfully learn the task at hand’"" (Anderson, 1984, p. 382). This is important because Staton (1989) explains that student learning—i.e. successful communication between instructor and pupil—occurs when teachers and students come to ""shared understandings"" (p.&nbsp;364). Thus, teachers must remember that they are ""cultural workers, not neutral professionals using skills on a culturally-detached playing field"" (Blanchett, Mumford & Beachum, 2005, p.&nbsp;306).   Teachers and administrators in the public school systems of the United States come in contact with a wide variety of sub-cultures and are at the forefront of the challenge of bringing diverse groups together within a larger American society. Issues confronting teachers and administrators on a daily basis include student learning disabilities, student behavioral problems, child abuse, drug addiction, mental health, and poverty, most of which are handled differently within different cultures and communities.   Examples of cultural conflicts often seen by teachers in the public school system include   role of women in the family and the decisions they can make  practices among cultural groups (e.g. fire cupping) symbol systems among cultural groups (see semiotics) .

Cultural Health African American culture African American contemporary issues African American history .  Native Americans in the United States .  The term “Hispanic” is troublesome. It is impossible to refer to “a Hispanic-American perspective” or to “a single Latino culture.”(1)(2) The label “Hispanic” is controversial because it was coined by the Federal Government to describe a heterogeneous ethnic population whose ancestors come from a Spanish speaking country. Although these American citizens have Latin American roots, the term “Latino” to characterize them is more correct since it is more inclusive of non-Spanish-speaking Latinos. However, the term ""Latino"" does not include individuals from Spanish speaking countries outside of Latin America (e.g., Spain).   There is also a lack of adequate research into how race and ethnicity affects members of a group.(3)(4)(5) There are few life histories and phenomenological studies of illness as experienced by people outside the American white, urban, middle class, especially of immigrant and native populations. Race has been used to explain the absence of research. Racial classifications are based on outmoded concepts and dubious assumptions regarding genetic differences. In fact, outside of skin color, race is poorly correlated with biological or cultural phenomena, which sharply diminishes its validity in biomedical or social research. Yet, unlike race or national origin, ethnicity is a sociological construct highly correlated with behavioral and cultural phenomena, particularly language, dress, adornment, food preference, religion, social interaction, marriage and family customs.  Further research is needed to determine whether race and ethnicity among Latinos are rather driven by mechanisms of discrimination and macrosocial factors or social status. Fortunately, not too long ago, the National Institutes of Health took an important step by insisting that any NIH- supported clinical investigation include, where appropriate, minority populations, women and the aged.(6) However, we must guard against what has been called a new “tokenism,"" that is, having a large aggregate of “non-whites”, and a few African Americans and some Hispanics included. This aggregate will never produce a proper sample. Rigorous attention to sample size, composition and sampling strategies is required to research basic psychosocial processes and clinical responses of minority populations. Accordingly, the heterogeneity of the Hispanic community has to be taken into account. The Hispanic’s country of origin, cultural history, migration history, language, family, traditions, religion, educational level, socio-economic status, gender, sexual orientation, age and generation--- all need to be explored.   1.

"3184","Marxist criminology is one of the schools of criminology. It parallels the work of the structural functionalism school which focuses on what produces stability and continuity in society but, unlike the functionalists, it adopts a predefined political philosophy. As in conflict criminology, it focuses on why things change, identifying the disruptive forces in industrialized societies, and describing how society is divided by power, wealth, prestige, and the perceptions of the world. ""The shape and character of the legal system in complex societies can be understood as deriving from the conflicts inherent in the structure of these societies which are stratified economically and politically"" (Chambliss, 1971, p3). It is concerned with the causal relationships between society and crime, i.e. to establish a critical understanding of how the immediate and structural social environment gives rise to crime and criminogenic conditions.   Karl Marx argued that the law is the mechanism by which one social class, usually referred to as the ""ruling class"", keeps all the other classes in a disadvantaged position. Thus, this school uses a Marxist lens through which, inter alia, to consider the criminalization process, and by which explain why some acts are defined as deviant whereas others are not. It is therefore interested in political crime, state crime, and state-corporate crime.  Marxism provides a systematic theoretical basis upon which to interrogate social structural arrangements, and the hypothesis that economic power is translated into political power substantially accounts for the general dis empowerment of the majority who live in the modern state and the limitations of political discourse. Hence, whether directly or indirectly, it informs much of the research into social phenomena not only in criminology, but also in semiotics and the other disciplines which explore the structural relationships of power, knowledge, meaning, and positional interests within society.   Many criminologists agree that for a society to function efficiently, social order is necessary and that conformity is induced through a socialization process. ""Law"" is the label given to one of the means used to enforce the interests of the state. Hence, because each state is sovereign, the law can be used for any purpose. It is also common ground that, whether the society is meritocratic, democratic or autocratic, a small group emerges to lead. The reason for this group's emergence may be their ability to use power more effectively, or simple expediency in that, as population size grows, the delegation of decision-making powers to a group representative of the majority leads to more efficiency. Marxists are critical of the ideas, values and norms of capitalist ideology, and characterize the modern state as being under the control of the group that owns the means of production. For example, Chambliss (1973) examined the way in which the vagrancy laws were amended to reflect the interests of the ruling elite. He also looked at how British Colonial Law was applied in East Africa, so that the capitalist ""ruling class"" could profit from coffee plantations, and how the law in medieval England benefited feudal landowners. Similarly, Pearce (2003) looks at evidence that corporate crime is widespread but is rarely prosecuted.   These researchers assert that political power is used to reinforce economic inequality by embedding individual property rights in the law and that the resulting poverty is one of the causes of criminal activity as a means of survival. Marxists argue that a socialist society with communal ownership of the means of production would have much less crime. Indeed, Milton Mankoff asserts that there is much less crime in Western Europe than in the U.S. because Europe is more ‘Socialist’ than America. The implication of such views is that the solution to the ""crime problem"" is to engage in a socialist revolution.   A different issue emerges by applying Marx's theory of alienation. A proportion of crime is said to be the result of society offering only demeaning work with little sense of creativity. However, the characterization of some crime as ""working class crime"" and portraying it as a response to oppression is problematic. It selectively labels crime committed by people simply on the basis of their membership of a class, without engaging in victimology to identify whether any particular class or group is most likely to be the victim of such crime (because many criminals are disinclined to travel far, working class crime is often directed at working class people who live in the same neighborhood). In fact, the social differentiation of crime may vary by age, class, ethnicity, gender, and locality.   Further, if anomie is a primary cause of crime, there should be a theory to explain why only some working class people commit crimes. These are existential issues. But if there is evidence that some individuals and, in some cases, entire groups are alienated from mainstream society, there should be detailed research into the effect that this has on society as a whole (see normlessness). In such research, Marxism tends to focus on societal forces rather than the motives of individuals and their dualistic capacity for both right and wrong, moral and immoral. This can lead to a less comprehensive explanation of why people exercise their autonomy by choosing to act in particular ways. By comparison, in the sociology of deviance, Robert K. Merton borrows Durkheim's concept of anomie to form the Strain Theory. Merton argues that the real problem of alienation is not created by a sudden social change, as Durkheim proposed, but rather by a social structure that holds out the same goals to all its members without giving them equal means to achieve them. It is this lack of integration between what the culture calls for and what the structure permits that causes deviant behaviour. Deviance then is a symptom of the social structure. Taylor et al. intend a combination of Interactionism and Marxism as a radical alternative to previous theories to formulate a ""fully social theory of deviance"".   The power to label behaviour as ""deviant"" arises partly from the unequal distribution of power within the state, and because the judgment carries the authority of the state, it attributes greater stigma to the prohibited behaviour. This is true no matter what the political orientation of the state. All states enact laws which, to a greater or lesser extent, protect property. This may take the form of theft, or prohibit damage or trespass. Even though a theft law may not appear judgmental, a Marxist analysis of the conviction rates may detect inequalities in the way in which the law is applied. Thus, the decision whether to prosecute or to convict may be skewed by having the resources to employ a good lawyer. The same analysis may also show that the distribution of punishment for any given crime may vary according to the social class of the perpetrator. But, the law of theft exists to protect the interests of all those who own property. It does not discriminate by reference to the class of the owner. Indeed, few laws in any states are drafted to protect property interests by reference to class, and the acceptance and enforcement of laws generally depend on a consensus within the community that such laws meet local needs. In this, a comparison of the crime rates between states shows little correlation by reference to political orientation. Such correlations as do exist tend to reflect disparities between rich and poor, and features describing the development of the social and economic environment. Hence, the crimes rates are comparable in states where there are the largest disparities of wealth distribution, regardless of whether they are first, second or third world.  Dutch criminologist, Willem Bonger, believed in a causal link between crime and economic and social conditions. He asserted that crime is social in origin and a normal response to prevailing cultural conditions. In more primitive societies, he contended that survival requires more selfless altruism within the community. But once agricultural technology improved and a surplus of food was generated, systems of exchange and barter began offered the opportunity for selfishness. As capitalism emerged, there were social forces of competition and wealth, resulting in an unequal distribution of resources, avarice and individualism. Once self interest and more egoistic impulses assert themselves, crime emerges. The poor would commit crime out of need or out of a sense of injustice. Hence, those with power exercise control and impose punishment, equating the definition of crime with harm or threat of harm to the property and business interests of the powerful. Although the inherent activities comprising, say, a theft, may be identical, theft by the poor will be given greater emphasis than theft by the rich. This will have two consequences: direct which will increase the pressure for survival in an unequal society, and indirect in that it will increase a sense of alienation among the poor. Crime in the streets was a result of the miserable conditions in which workers lived in competition with one another. He believed that poverty alone could not be a cause of crime but rather poverty coupled with individualism, materialism, false needs, racism, and the false masculinity of violence and domination among street thugs.  Sellin was a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania and one of the pioneers of scientific criminology. His method involved a comprehensive view of the subject incorporating historical, sociological, psychological, and legal factors into the analysis. He applied both Marxism and Conflict Theory to an examination of the cultural diversity of modern industrial society. In a homogeneous society, norms or codes of behaviour will emerge and become laws where enforcement is necessary to preserve the unitary culture. But where separate cultures diverge from the mainstream, those minority groups will establish their own norms. Socialization will therefore be to the subgroup and to the mainstream norms. When laws are enacted, they will represent the norms, values and interests of the dominant cultural or ethnic group which may produce Border Culture Conflict. When the two cultures interact and one seeks to extend its influence into the other, each side is likely to react protectively. If the balance of power is relatively equal, an accommodation will usually be reached. But if the distribution of power is unequal, the everyday behaviour of the minority group may be defined as deviant. The more diversified and heterogeneous a society becomes, the greater the probability of more frequent conflict as subgroups who live by their own rules break the rules of other groups.","ibm-debater-claim-evidence-emnlp"

"james_3182_universal-health-care_con_opening_daniel","We should not introduce universal healthcare. I want to clarify a couple of things before I launch into our three constructive arguments. The first is that this universal health care implies that people have some sort of buy in whether that be requiring people to have private insurance as is the case in some countries or introducing some sort of public insurance scheme like the united kingdom has ultimately people are paying for their premiums, either in the form of taxes or payments to a private insurance company and all universal health care does this require everyone to do this and not allows people to choose to opt out is the used to be able to in the united states. So from this perspective, even the united states, which requires people to purchase private health care, has universal health care. Our first argument is that it is unfair to make young people subsidize older people, how does health insurance work basically healthy people have to buy a product that they don't need in order to let less healthy people get that product at an affordable price. So young people who probably don't need to go to the doctor more than once a year for a quick check up, are forced to pay for very expensive insurance schemes. So that elderly people who consume huge amounts of resources are able to receive those same treatments more cheaply. We think that this is fundamentally unfair people ought not be forced to subsidize others and take on huge risks to themselves. But I think in particular that it's unfair because elderly people are not asked to subsidize young people in the same way in countries like the US or britain, for instance, young people have to pay huge amounts of money to attend university and don't receive public subsidy to do so. So ultimately, we think that this is a one way street that you're requiring younger people to pay for the elderly and not investing in a similar way in helping the young. We think that if anything society should work, the other way it should take from older people who have had time to accrue more resources and give it to younger people who happened and who represent the future. This also punishes healthy people by extension. If you run every day for your whole life and eat a healthy diet, then you're much less likely to need expensive health care in your old age than someone who smokes a pack a day and it's nothing, but cheeseburgers so healthy people are being forced to pay for the health insurance to people who made forced decisions this one disincentive vices people from making good decisions and to punishes people who did make good decisions which we think fundamentally is unfair. We think that if you choose to make decisions that make your health care costs lower that you shouldn't have to bear the higher cost for those who didn't make those good choices at the end of the day, forcing everyone to pay for health insurance, whether through a government scheme like national health in britain or through mandatory private insurance like obamacare is unfair to many groups of society, it either punishes them based on an intrinsic characteristic like age war, it punishes those who made good decisions and privileges those who make poor decisions we think either option is unacceptable. Our third and final point is that this forces people to fund controversial treatments in the united states, no federal money may be used for abortions, but we still see that government health money goes to fund things like treatments that would not otherwise be covered for instance, treatments that use stem cell research, which many people consider to be unethical. We don't think that people ought to be compelled to pay for treatments which are contrary to their own moral principles to do so undermines the ability of people to live according to their own ethical principles when they don't conflict with anyone else if people want to receive abortions, we think that that's fine if people want to use the products of stem cell research were similarly okay with that, but we think that it's wrong to compel christians to pay for that which necessarily and national healthcare scheme that pays for those things would do. So at the end of the day, we oppose forcing people to purchase insurance because it's unfair to certain groups based on their beliefs. Thank you.","ibm-record-debating-dataset-v2"
"tim_3186_flat-tax_pro_opening","We should introduce a flat tax in the status quo. The majority of income taxes in western liberal democracies are progressive taxes that disproportionately tax wealthy earners and take their money, even though they're the people that are least likely to take government services for this reason. We would propose that the states are that states introduce an income tax that is a flat tax that ensures that all people that are capable of paying taxes were not currently many, a minimum earnings limit that allows you to have a taxable income because we think that certain people simply cannot pay taxes because of the situation they're in but instances in which people can afford to pay taxes all people have to pay the same proportion of their income into the government. So we think that it's essential that this occurs because recognize that all individuals are exist under coercive apparatus of the state of matter how wealthy one is or how poor one is all people have been forced into the state by circumstances of where they were born, or because of where they had to go to live for jobs or other types of social reasons no one entirely freely chooses to be within the state and even if they did the state cannot simply because of consent shoes to abuse its people, the state can only be justified can only exist in the just weigh it serves to benefit all of its people. This means that the state doesn't equal burden to all citizens even of certain citizens for their own free power and capabilities are able to earn more within the state apparatus than other individuals. What we think this means is that when you have other systems of taxation, such as a progressive tax, you choose to ignore the claims of representation that certain members of your constituency habit, it means that you're saying that the freedom of property, the freedom to accumulate property and accumulate wealth is different. Once you get richard says that the humanity and the claims you have to ownership are diluted when you are a more wealthy human being and it's one porn to recognize that the vast majority of wealthy individuals in western liberal democracies are not individuals that are taking the types of social benefits that taxes go to pay. They pay into certain things that they're simply never going to use things like welfare benefits, things like social security. These are things that wealthy the visuals are forced to pay into but gained little benefit from. Yes, it's true, that these individuals can benefit from infrastructure, protection for the army. All these things just as everyone else does. But it is the case of these individuals simply are not getting as much out of the government directly as poor individuals are what this means is that it is unfair, principally to force these people to pay more and that when you have progressive taxes, it allows for drastic spending to take place because it and because constituencies and the base of the people in the public know that they will not be the ones that have to bear the burden, the spending burden that increased government spending costs we think that if you're going to instrument no new government programs, you're gonna, play place more course of power into state and if you're going to ensure that the state is more capable of taking from the people within the state and stealing the property that they have earned, it is important that all people there, the ramifications of this equally yes, it is the case that lasted less wealthy individuals have less disposable income at their at their disposal. But this doesn't mean that their claims to ownership change because of the quantity of ownership that you have rather claims of ownership matter because of the importance of valuing property and a broad and principled manner. We think that flat taxes do the best job of representing that in flat taxes, do the best job of ensuring that not only to all people bear the same burden. But all people are given the same level of right to property as anyone else in the status quo there's, a system that allows spending to run wild in the government level with the burden being pushed dramatically on a small segment of society that burden isn't fair given the responsibility of the state has to all citizens and the conception of the state serves to serve exist to serve all given this. We should introduce a flat tax.","ibm-record-debating-dataset-v2"
"will_1542_libertarian_con_opening_daniel","I'm proud to stand improper opposition to the motion that we should adopt libertarianism. I think generally speaking the way the cover proche. This was to say here is a high level reason might tear reading of the majority is bad. I don't think though that that justifies abolition of a lot of important public resources that are important to minimizing suffering in the world given this, I think that you can basically say okay, here's some really bad things that happen in the status quo, but generally speaking democracy should solve for that generally speaking, the government does more good than harm. And what I want to talk to you about is the ways in which the government reduces suffering by having the sort of infrastructure that god would get rid of first, we would say that redistributive taxation and redistributive policies in general are good. Secondly, we would say that regulations are good. And third, we would say that public resources that are acceptable to all are good first on redistributive policies, we think in the world their houses and have nots. This is true because it is probably honestly exacerbated on their side of the house. But there are people who are poor they're people who are not poor in when you were born to someone who is poor. You are also poor is the lottery of birth it's, not that people who are poor are intrinsically worth last, but they suffer more because of a lack of resources. We think then that it is justified for the government to engage in policies that take from the rich the house and give to the poor house knots. This is for really two reasons. The first is that equity decreases not suffering, suffering, doesn't exist on a linear scale that is if you pump a bunch of money into a rich person's pocket, they don't suddenly do with that much better that's because the generally spend it on things that aren't really important to quality of life in the way that things like healthcare, other basic things are they'll, spend it on things like a nice car, a nice house, but secondly, we think that diminishing marginal returns important concept in economics also apply to income. So when I have lots of disposable money, it's not worth as much to me because the diminishing marginal returns on the individual dollars that I have are less and less the more I happen to think equalizing the playing field means the most utility, because people get the most bang for their buck. They value with the most our second independent point is that regulations are these particular protects the weak from the powerful onside government. You get rid of the regulations that prevent really bad things like pollution and price gouging things like that things were a third party is harmed, but the person engaging in the bad action doesn't have an incentive to just not do it on their own. And this makes for an inherently worse world. You create things the increase in net suffering, because the individual people engaging in these problematic actions. Don't have a force pushing against them to say don't do this thing that makes the world significantly worse. Our third in opinion point is the public resources are good that there are things that we should all have equal access to because they're facilitative to basic quality of life. I think a good example of this is roads or sidewalks things that are important for us getting from point a to point b. But if the government relinquishes control of these types of things, if they privatize roads and things like that it's, like a lot of really, really, like, very libertarian people would like to see then you have a lot of harms for the people that need that to get from point a to point b. I think you wind up putting a lot of money into the pockets of people that already have money and saving it off of the people that need these public resources in order to do things like get to their work or get to a hospital or all these other things. When you privatize out the services you make life very, very difficult for people that don't have the means to deal with the private sector, I think that's a significant problem, and I think that it leads to a lot of suffering. Look, I understand the sort of philosophical justifications that are given by government. I don't think though that they reconcile with the intense suffering that is created by the realization of these high level, philosophical ideas, proud to oppose.","ibm-record-debating-dataset-v2"
"daniel_221_ban-gambling_con_opening_yaar","We absolutely should not ban gambling because it won't work first of all and secondarily there's, nothing really wrong with gambling. It should be fine, it should be legal. I want to do it so let's start by caulking about why banning gambling will not work at all. So the point of banning something presumably is you wanted her people from doing it because you think it has some kind of harm or problem on. So this has an assumption, and the assumption is that the band itself is actually going to turn people from the activity in the first place that is gambling so that's, not gonna happen and it's not gonna happen because people have been gambling for thousands of years people rather enjoy gambling on it's, a pretty ingrained part of our culture. We have entire cities dedicated to it, you know, like there's gambling in las vegas, obviously I'm pretty sure there's a lot of gambling in places like a lot, israel as well, there's all kinds of like a lot of cities, how these as their industries and things like that. So their fondest of first and foremost, a problem is that you're gonna see a whole lot of resistance from the people who are involved in the gambling industry, a whole lot of resistance about the cities and livelihood that are being destroyed and a whole lot of resistance to all these kinds of policies in bands in the first place. But the second and more importantly, it's completely unenforceable because you can just gamble on the internet in there's, nothing really the government can do to regulate it, because oftentimes the websites can be set up in like different countries or you can even if like the web sites are under like any kind of certain set of laws, you're there's always ways that you can use the internet to avoid government detection, and I highly doubt that the government is going to dedicate like legit military and hacking and all kinds of technical and physical and monetary resources to really cracking down gambling. And if I wanted to do that, it would cost like billions of not probably like, like so much so many billions of dollars that it would be a complete waste of time since people are largely going to do it on the internet anyway and that's, obviously a problem because first and foremost you're, not making the money off of gambling anymore, you can't tax gambling, you can't profit off of it. So a lot of money in revenue is going away. Additionally, when you band something it becomes a part of the black market it's more likely to be unsafe, you're more likely going to have like crime lords and people like that presiding over the factors. And additionally, you also can have things like consumer protection laws in place I so you can't really enforce things to make sure that like you'd, obviously gambling is random and to a large extent, things like that, but enforcement to make sure that like you aren't being as a gambler like completely screwed over by the people like the house, per se so that's important as well arms. So gambling's probably not. But anyway might as well happen safer more profitably more effectively, if you just regulated rather than bad, but I also think that there's nothing wrong with that gambling and it's rather immoral to band in the first place because keep in mind that when people are gambling they're usually gambling with their own money, if they're gambling with someone else's money, we call them wall street bankers, so they're, usually gambling with their own money, not other people's, so that's money that you've earned that's money that you can do what you want with. You should have the right to spend your money on the way you want because you work for it when additionally gambling doesn't harm anyone it's not late. It gambling is really harm people like any kind of the big things like crime, or whatever that like me deeply associate with gambling is problematic that's using only because the other things like drugs or prostitution or whatever are legal in the first place, maybe not to be legal to, but also keep in mind that like the black market argument that I made about how that's not gonna be solved anyway. So other than maybe like the v facilitation of crime there's, no real reason, why gambling itself is all that bad why you should be able to spend your money on that you aren't that way if you want. So for those reasons, we should not ban gambling.","ibm-record-debating-dataset-v2"
"WS_2361_athletic-scholarships_con_opening_SSH","I am proud to stand in opposition of the motion that we should and athletic scholarships to independent points. First athletic scholarships are beneficial to colleges and academic institutions as a whole. This is because for really two reasons the first is that the programs generate money, which then goes to act x. So when you have the sort of like athletic scholarship programs, there largely funded by like grants all corporate sponsorships, like all sorts of like weeds and would like just selling seats ghetto selling like TV rights, odd to like it TV stations that want to broadcast the games. There are lots of ways. These bring money into the college in wall gov is correct to point out that a lot of money gets spent on these programs, building stadiums and things like that there is also a lot more money coming in, and this usually gets redirected to academic programs. This is important because the primary purpose of colleges should be academics that is that it actually ensures that students are well educated, it gives them the product that they purchased it. It also creates a societal good. So when the athletic programs actually funnel money into the university that's, a good thing and athletic scholarships, facilitate this by making athletic careers at colleges, more attractive and thereby increasing that talent pool of those athletic programs, thus making them more desirable to wash making them more competitive insuring, more corporate sponsors will be interested in sponsoring them, and so on it is a way of facilitating, a nother thing that is a good, but secondly, it helps colleges in college students by just being anything that increases the quality of life on campus. I think much in the same way that like nice well designed habitable dorms are a good thing, even though they're not intrinsically important to the quality of education. It is something that we can just generally defend, because the colleges at the end of the day are selling students a product that is the student pays like whatever sixty thousand dollars a year to go to this place. There is a reason they pay that much is because the university provides things that are pleasing to the students quality of life. And we defense things like competitive sports that are fun to watch and improve that quality of life. Not just because it is good when people have a higher quality of life, but also the because that higher quality of life facilitates the goals like scholarship that it is easier to be invested in your classes when your life is just generally good in your all miserable because you're bored when you're nodding classes like providing these forms of letting stress out and enjoying yourself or facilitative to the other goals of academic institutions. Secondly, we would say that these athletic scholarships provide an opportunity for poor individuals and minorities the second independent point. So we would say that this is a path towards a higher education with less berry years than something like like being extremely studious and doing well on tests. And the reason for this is two fold first is there rich, well, educated, people generally team tend to value the well educated path to getting into college that is that the people that these poor people and minorities actually have to compete with for seats in the college oral taking the education path to get there. So in so far as that's the more crowded path, we think there's going to be less structural barriers to trying to take the athletic scholarship passed to get into college. Secondly, if you ban one of the past, obviously the first one gets way more crowded so again, it's going to be tougher for poor minority students to get through. But thirdly, we think the structural barriers are just weaker on the athletic path, like even though rich people can hire like coaches and trainers for their kids they're a lot less likely to do so than a tutor, not just because the tutors cheaper, but also because there's just more tutors out there. So we think that generally speaking rich families are going to take less opportunities in terms of giving their kids a leg up on the athletic route when the scholarship group works just fine. So we think then that are poor and minority students disproportionately benefit from the athletic route to college also colleges just like a good thing because it breaks cyclical. Poverty, proud to oppose.","ibm-record-debating-dataset-v3"
"WS_2081_nuclear-power_con_opening_JL","I'm proud to stand in opposition to the motion that we should further exploit nuclear power. Our first independent point is the waste generated by nuclear power, so government briefly addresses this and essentially wasted office by being like we, you know, you come out, and for example, use like hide it deep in them out, and it won't create any issues. So I think there's a couple problems regarding nuclear waste that aren't addressed by side government. There are to begin with extreme environmental harms on this is something that because it is radioactive waste can damage your all local wildlife fauna and flora that sort of thing and undermine the integrity of local ecosystems. This can have pretty wide reaching the facts, even the damage to one individual species can throw the balance of an entire ecosystem out of sync and can lead to a huge amounts of you know, degradation of plant life can lead to the extinction of local species. So we think that even mild effects on the environment can blossom house into significant harms is not only undermines aesthetic things like the beauty of the environment, but also if you believe in like animal rights, for example and just believe that things that like experience like pleasure and suffering should you know, be afforded more pleasure that suffering this is a significant issue. The problem with the you can mount and defense is two fold one, we can't store all of our waste, and you come out and and two there isn't a lot of political will to create the sort of like high expense situations you could mountain is unique in that it was easy to sort of find like hollowed out spaces in it to store the nuclear waste, but that's generally not an option. And usually you can't just like drilled deep into the core of a mail in in store all your waist and they're. Usually what happens is that this week's gets buried somewhere underground, they just kind of make like a site for it like you would a landfill, and you destroy that area so not only are the environmental harms that going to materialize placing secondly, and probably even more importantly, these harms are generally internalized by poor minority communities. One, particularly prevalent example was the dumping of nuclear waste, sierra blanca and taxes, which was a primarily latino community, these actions that disproportionately harmed poor individuals who are often are politically incapable of fighting these types of things makes it such that those who are already experiencing disproportionate suffering from an economic perspective, are then forced to indoor the brunt of the issues with nuclear power while others reap the benefits this in essence, then is a significant issue that we think on face makes it problematic to engage in nuclear power. Our second independent point is that nuclear power opens the door for the increase proliferation of nuclear weapons. Obviously the odd technology for developing these two things has a certain degree of similarities. And at the point where things like missile programs are difficult to crack down on. It is often easy to conduct a nuclear program in secret arm, highly enriched uranium, that's necessary for weapons grade the nuclear weapons arm is often not that much more in rich to then then then then power base uranium on the basis that on the enriching processes, exponential. So it's easier to make the leap that if you proliferate, the incidence of odd do actual nuclear power. And as such, we think then because nuclear weapons are particularly problematic in their ability to wreak significant havoc and also incredibly problematic in their ability to give disproportionate powers to unstable regimes. We think that there is a significant harm on a worldwide basis on created by the proliferation of this type of power note that most of the stable regimes already half nuclear power. So it is unlikely that the proliferation will continue giving more nuclear power to people who you know, are not worth worrying about prod to oppose.","ibm-record-debating-dataset-v3"
"WS_3182_universal-health-care_con_opening_JL","I'm proud to stand in opposition of the motion that we should guarantee universal health care. Our first independent point is the guaranteeing universal health care is particularly expensive and creates a significant track on government coffers. The united states is a good example of this where already even though we're not even covering everybody. A significant portion of our country's spending is sunk into health care costs, things like medicare and medicaid, this isn't a cheap thing to provide for people, and one of the fundamental reasons for it is that the more coverage is sponsored by the government, the more of health care costs. The reason for this is a what's called a a principal agent issue that is when the person who's paying for the good isn't, the person who benefits for the good there's, a problem both in terms of the quality of the good provided, but also in terms of the incentive of payment, the united states government faces, political pressure to make payments regardless of the quality of the care provided is as such then they're often going to pay increasing amounts of money for the same costs. This is a problem because the money that the united states government pays doesn't come from like thin air. It comes from the government's coffers, and this is money that can easily be reallocated to more effective uses of capital wall. Healthcare is a facilitative, right other things like housing and food are also facilitate if rates. So we think at the point where the government has to make active decisions on what it's going to spend its money on it, we think that it is better for the government to spend money on something like housing programs are snap benefits, which will ensure that facilitative rights are still being met, but it will do so in a way that doesn't actually create ballooning costs within that industry, our second independent point is that there is a need to consent out, and we think this is a fundamental right arm. We think the people should specifically have a right to consent out of health care. This is an informed decision that is that people often will make it a conscious decision about whether or not healthcare is a smart bennett is a smart investment for them, and we think, particularly younger people often see that they are quite healthy and not in need of paying a significant portion of their income towards health care, rather, they would rather just keep the money and given that the chance of them needed to go to the hospitals quite small, spend on other important things like food and shelter. The issue though, is that if you know personal health care is guaranteed even if there's an opt out capacity on over the eight, there can't be an opt out capacity, you need something like what the united states on obamacare individual mandate to ensure that the system will operate because the functional nature of healthcare pools is that you balloon up the costs that are going to be created by the sick people by having that healthy people pay into it. It is a problem that because if we find the individuals have a right to consent out of this product and make the active decision that they're not going to sink their money into something that they don't need to the system fails, easy, you engage in mass rights violations, or you just have a failing health care system either way. This is significantly worse than the status quo. Our third independent point is the providing universal healthcare is redistributive economics. Those are bad. So we specifically what we mean is that how the providing universal health care at the point where most wealthy people already have health care anyway involves taking money from wealthier individuals and putting it into public social spending programs that will then be pre allocated to poor individuals. The problem with this is that wealthy individuals how a rights claim to their property that is the capital that is then being taxed and then reinvested into poor individuals, we think that quite often they earn this money giving them a particular deserve claim to it, but beyond this, we think that it is also a fundamental violation of one's property rights to take their property from them forcefully this in turn is a significant abuse on the part of the government prod to oppose.","ibm-record-debating-dataset-v3"
"SSH_1542_libertarian_con_opening_WS","I stand and firm opposition to the motion that we should adopt libertarianism. There are few political ideologies as fundamentally misconstrued as fundamentally miss championed as libertarianism is a system which favors the rich and the powerful, although the adoption of libertarianism in many ways seems like the adoption of natural forms of power, natural ways of thinking. We would say that all that does is create a vacuum or the presently rich and powerful can decide literally every rule they want for themselves incredibly little government oversight. One overview before three reasons why we should not adopt libertarianism may overviews very simply that in any western over the market, see where this kind of debate would ever be possible, the alternatives, our liberty and democracy without adopting libertarianism, we can easily adopt a system work every individual gets a say in the government where there's not profound amounts of gerrymandering or abuse, and where there is ample amounts of government intervention and regulation in this speech, I'm going to show it. Why is such that we have the social benefits of government regulation and control that we need to solve pro found the problematic like the actual problems. And thirdly, how the powerful can never regulate themselves first off on social benefits. The most obvious way in which a libertarianism can exert itself in the united states or a variety of other western liberal governments by the immediate removal of social benefits and taxes, we would say things like welfare unemployment. Social security are essential in the status quo for helping people survive, many people who have already retired, could not buy food housing, any of the necessities if not for social security. But even if we only have this debate in the abstract rather than having a debate about the specific people who would literally starve as a result of this policy, we would say that every government has people at the lows and society who due to genetic factors to historical factors have been pushed to the bottom and cannot afford the basic necessities. If the government refused to provide them no one else will we see that in the status quo there's already incredible difficulty getting private industry to actually invest in the poorest people in society, they typically do it because the capitalist incentive of having a tax benefit is also there and because it's good for PR the system where the government has signaled that social benefits and social welfare are not a key interest and that there's no benefits to corporations. We think that this would also fall. And at that point, the poorest individuals would have no ability to essentially feed themselves, which is the greatest harm that can be actualized upon them to the government action. The second argument is that this creates profound collective action problems. We think things like roads, we think a central emergency services must be solved through collective action. The alternative is private individuals, creating toll roads, decreasing the efficiency of entire society is creating police forces and fire services first making it so they have total power to control individuals by literally refusing them lifesaving services and secondly, refusing the poor the services making their lives, even more difficult, even the status quo is incredibly expensive to be poor at the point where we got powerful individuals can charge even more to poor families. We think that the system is fundamentally unjust. My third argument is the idea of regulation you cannot trust individuals to police themselves. This is been seen throughout history. Most recently in the financial sector, with two thousand the two thousand eight financial crisis. And we think that the doctor libertarianism is just giving the power to the individuals who must be policed overall things.

There's plenty of evidence to show that the best thing you can do for your kids is engage with them (ie. more time at home, less time at work) and make their home life an enriching one. This is not about real ""choice"". When middle-class parents go private, they are supporting a shift that will see public schools become a residual system for the poor. I send my kids to public schools because I care about them - their links with their diverse local community etc - but also because I care about the kind of culture they live in. To me, learning to care about and contribute to society as a whole - not just your own personal interests - is the best value a child can inherit. How well a child does at school depends on the child itself not the school it goes to.Attitude to studies is all important.If a student's mind is occupied with sex, drugs and alcohol you can't expect good results.

"NOOS1021","This essay is about whether or not there are any place for dreaming and imagination in the modern world of today. Are we left any room for our own imaginations when our heads are filled over the brim with more or less useful information every day? We may be entertained by the television 24 hours a day, we may download information about nearly everything in the world on our computers, we don't even have to move outside our own houses to get food. In a world like this, is there really any room where we can be all by our selves, where we can think our own thoughts and use the creative abilities that lies within us as a potential energy source? I will try to show that this is still possible in our modern world, I will even try to explain why dreaming is the basic source of development of our species. But first I will define what I mean by dreaming. What do we really mean by dreaming and imagination? Is it only what goes on in our heads at night-time? No, dreaming is a lot of things. Dreaming is using our creative abilities in a way that influences our lives and our surroundings. Most things start with dreaming or using our imagination. Like when one should choose a career in life, or when the 12 year old is working really hard to earn money for a new bike. The dream is like a carrot that keeps us going. Dreaming is also escaping from the world we live in, and this I will look into later. Where would we be today if it was not for our ability to dream and use our imagination? A person that stops dreaming, that can't see oneself in an imaginary world, is a person with no personality. Then the main difference between human beings is then gone. As long as a person is dreaming and having ideas about one self and the surroundings in an imaginary future there is room for improvement an further development of the human species and the world we live in. If Bill Gates did not have a dream that he could develop a computer-program that would revolutionise the world, where would we be today? Dreaming and using our imagination is the modern Darwinism. We don't have to be physically stronger than our opponents to be the survivor in the society of today. What divides winners and losers in our world is more of an intellectual art. And the more able one are of having dreams and following these dreams in hope of fulfilling them, the bigger the chance of succeeding in this society of competition. The fact that most people in the western world belongs to one or another religious foundation, is a proof that we are not capable of living a life without having any dreams. The more complex, ""smaller"" and faster the world becomes, the bigger is the need for something to believe in, something to escape to when we have had too much. Where people two hundred years ago sought comfort because they could not understand, people today seek comfort because they can't handle all the information. Believing in a superstitious being is using ones imagination, dreaming that there is something better. One solid proof that there is room for dreaming and imagination in the society today we find within sports. How many thousands of boys and girls all over the world do not dream of one day standing on the podium receiving the gold medal. Not many get to the top, but I think we all have dreamt of being there. The dream of one day to have a victory over ones own fears and crossing the inner borders have driven many people towards achievements one would not have reached without dreaming. I think it is wrong saying that there is no room for dreaming and imagination in our modern world. If it was not for dreaming the world would not work at all. Dreams may help us getting further in developing our surroundings. Dreaming is by my opinion the main source of creativity in our society. Dreams may also be a way of getting away from a complex world things happen fast and continuously. Even though the world has become smaller, even though less is left to our imagination, we still escape to our different dream worlds through our imagination.","utdallas-icle-essay-scoring"
"BGSU1216","Nowadays, a lot of people claim that there is no place for dreaming in our hectic reality dominated by computers and hi-tech electronics. However, this is not the case. People do have the opportunity to dream, only that their dreams are different. Technologies does not prevent one from having sacred wishes - they create a different world where dreams have their due place. To begin with, the modern world is not that gloomy and especially young people have ideas of their future life that are sometimes closer to imagination than to the real state of events. They dream of love and romantic experiences even with practically perfect strangers, of adventures on desert islands, and now more that ever, youths dream of touching the stars. Children play their insane computer games imagining they have power and live in a world different from ours. Also, more and more boys and girls use the Internet in order to make acquaintances with other people with mutual interests, or merely with people who share the same urge for the unknown. Is it not a way of dreaming? One can be whoever one wishes to, one can live, at least for some hours in another town, country, why not completely different world. Besides, people pay much more attention to music these days. We spend a lot of money to buy an original audio record or to go to a concert of our favourite band. We do this and we will keep on doing this because, of course it is show business but not only, music is a way to escape from the suppressing reality of today. Styles like ambient, goa and psychedelic trance become more and more valued for they make one dream, cut all connections with what is thought to be the real world. In this respect, the twenty-first century will be marked with the image of the double conscience. In other words, people will be looking for their alter ego, will be living in search of their lost half and will be aspiring for the peace of their souls more than ever before. That is why, some are attracted to Buddhism, yoga, even astrology and other untraditional philosophy and use them as a means of entering a different dimension of existence. In short, people dream. Probably, owe to our 'made-up' reality, or probably despite it. Authors like Herman Hesse, Audous Huxley, George Orwell and many others dreamt for the lost soul of the true human being, who was lost himself in a too complex world of machines and artificial intellects. They were pioneers of the idea of the 'brave new world' which is actually a representation of our contemporary reality. Finally, technologies do not deprive us from the opportunity to dream. What is more important, one should manage to survive in spite of them. Music, religion, books, writing poems, singing, drugs, whatever. Anything that brings you closer to the world of your dreams helps. People are not designed to be told what to think, they are free creatures who will always wait for the moment when they will see what happens on the dark side of the Moon.","utdallas-icle-essay-scoring"
"015-areyoudrinkingbecauseyourework.txt","Are you drinking because you're working long hours, or are you working long hours to justify drinking?  An international study released last week has identified that those who work more than 48 hours a week are 11% more likely to drink alcohol at risk levels than those working a standard week .  The study was compiled by Finnish researchers , sampling 300,000 subjects across Europe, Australia and North America . Health guidelines suggest that consumption of more than 14 drinks a week for women and 21 drinks for men poses a significant health risk .  It's no surprise that it's a team of Finnish researchers who are examining the stats around unsafe drinking . Nordic Finland may be a well-known haven of progressive social policy, with an enviable living standard, cradle-to-grave welfare and the world's best education system , but there is one social problem the Finns have not yet licked . Alcohol-related illnesses and incidents (including accidents , violence and suicide in which alcohol has factored) are the most common cause of death for both working age men and women there - and have been so for many years .  The study is of useful consideration for Australians, of course - we're afflicted with alcohol problems of our own . Australian research released only last July revealed up to 15 people die and more than 430 are admitted to hospital every day in Australia for alcohol-related reasons . That's 5,554 deaths and 157,132 hospital admissions a year, and four times the rate of the road toll .  That working longer hours has a detrimental effect on an individual's health is well established . Some have suggested from the results of the Finnish study that alcohol abuse is symptomatic of the ""work hard, play hard"" cultures around professions - especially because workers who shifted into longer-hours jobs during the study were 12% more likely to develop risky drinking habits as a result .  Some have also suggested that the scarcity of leisure time for people who work long hours may result in habits of using alcohol as a concentrated form of relaxant . This is the opinion of Cassandra A  Okechukwu, assistant professor at the Harvard School of Public Health who declared of the Finnish findings that ""people are self-medicating"" due to work-life time constraints .  Alternatively, Dr Richard Wise, psychologist at Windana Drug and Alcohol Recovery, believes the relationship between work and drinking may be bi- directional . ""As stress increases the activity of brain regions responsible for drug seeking and craving , stressful work is often 'addictive' in itself,"" says Wise . ""This could be a self-perpetuating cycle - work causes stress , which renders people more prone to addictions to substances and work.""  Significantly , the study itself does not claim to prove a causation - leaving open the possibility to discuss the pink elephant that lurks in the room behind all social discussions of problem drinking: the prevalent, if sometimes well-camouflaged, existence of actual alcoholics .  Writing in Business Insider , journalist Kevin Loria asked of the study : ""Long hours may not cause dangerous drinking , but why is there a relationship between those two things at all?"" The answer is this : there is not one clear relationship, but potentially several . We know, for example , that those suffering active alcoholism seek out environments that facilitate and camouflage their drinking . Why would the workplace be an exception?  Demanding jobs not only deliver alcoholics out of the worksite just in time for socially-acceptable drinking hours , but the stresses associated with long - hours work provide pretexts aplenty for ""self-medicating"" with booze . Our community continues to excuse the practise of drowning one's sorrows , but forgotten is that active alcoholics often go looking for sorrows in order to drown them .  The recovery community calls this phenomenon ""drinking on it"" - it's not hard to find a pretext to slam down some craved-for cold ones at the end of the day if you've just spent 10 hours at a desk . And if there' s one thing an alcoholic can use to deny the extent of their drinking`cond , it's the company of others who share the same problem . The common logic of alcohol addiction brings alcoholics together in work environments as much as it does social ones .  Yet while study after study identifies alcohol as a health, economic and justice burden on the community, and with the statistical acknowledgement that 3.7 million Australians are currently ""drinking at long-term risky levels"" , we're still - still - struggling to break our social addiction to the old stereotypes of alcoholics being weak-willed, staggering hobos rather than predominantly people with jobs, relationships and families who are sick with a dangerous medical problem . If we choose to believe someone is drinking because they work long hours , we may be ignoring that someone is working long hours because it enables their drinking .  A failure to identify behaviours symptomatic with alcoholism delays treatment and increases the danger alcoholics pose to themselves and to others . Go back and look at the figures above: 5,500+ deaths and 150,000+ hospital admissions a year are not the result of mere casual tipples . They're the stats of widespread abuse that needs more than loose causation and euphemisms to treat it .  The Finnish study is valuable because it identifies a possible workplace component to the alcohol problem . With 3.7 million Australians presently at risk, the time is now to be realistic that a broader context of alcoholism exists .","webis-editorials-16"
"220-realthreatindianstate.txt","The real threat to the Indian state.  India projects itself as a target of Islamic terrorism perpetrated by home- grown Indian Mujahideen (IM) or Pakistan-based outfits particularly in India- administered Kashmir essentially to garner sympathy internationally and unite the population .  The truth, however, is that many armed groups like the Maoist uprising in the ""Red Corridor"" and the secessionist rebellion in the north-east pose a graver challenge to the Indian state than bombings and sporadic terrorist strikes which New Delhi touts to validate its vulnerability-cum-victimhood narrative before the world .  The latest Global Terrorism Index released by international think tank Institute of Economics and Peace reveals that while jihadists were responsible for 15 percent of terrorism-related killings in India ; Maoists accounted for the lion's share of casualties - a whopping 50 percent - in 2013 . The remaining 35 percent of deaths were caused by guerillas fighting for statehood or independence in states like Assam, Manipur and Nagaland .  Armed group, the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) , which gunned down 75 Adivasis, or tribespeople, just before Christmas in its diabolical pursuit of a separate homeland for ethnic Bodos in Assam , was on the government's radar for a long time .  The carnage provoked an uncompromising crackdown by the Indian army but thereby hangs a grim tale of political expediency .  Syed Asif Ibrahim, Intelligence Bureau director, seemed to have a premonition of the massacre . He pointed out that NDFB has become one of the deadliest separatist outfits in business at the IB's 49th annual conference in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Interior Minister Rajnath Singh in Assam's largest city, Guwahati, last month .  He observed that one option before the government was to bring NDFB to the negotiating table .  At present, though, negotiations are out of the question . ""How can you hold talks with terrorists who thrust a gun into a five-month-old baby's mouth?"" the interior minister said at a press conference even , as he dispatched army chief General Dalbir Singh Suhag to capture the killers and smash the group's network .  Singh could well have cited another instance of sheer savagery - a seven-year - old boy was shot seven times in his foot, thigh, abdomen, hand and face - to build a stronger case for the clampdown which surprised many .  Clearly, lightning action by the Bharatiya Janata Party-led federal government was in sharp contrast to the nationalist party's known stand on Bodo violence . The BJP didn't shed tears when NDFB shot dead 50 Bengali-speaking Muslims in May . But the party's own poll campaign then underway accused Bangladeshi Muslims of ""destroying"" India .  So the killings jelled with the BJP's political rhetoric; just days before the May butchery , Modi declared that Bangladeshis must keep their ""bags packed"" for deportation if he captured power .  Similarly , when NDFB slaughtered nearly a 100 Muslims and displaced half a million in July-August 2012 , senior BJP leader Lal Krishna Advani immediately extended moral support to the Bodos . He publicly argued that the blood-bath was the result of a silent Bangladeshi demographic invasion straining resources and creating insecurity among Bodos .  The party also organised a seminar in New Delhi on ""Bodo Hindus - Refugees in their own land: Bangladeshi Muslim infiltrators - the new kingmakers in an Indian state"" with then BJP president, Nitin Gadkari, as a key speaker .  But decoding the BJP's somersault is pretty easy . NDFB killing Muslims and forcing terrified survivors into hellish refugee camps was par for the course as far as BJP was concerned . But training their guns on Adivasis was a blunder NDFB will regret for a long time .  The BJP immediately let loose the army on NDFB to repay a big debt of gratitude and regain Adivasi goodwill crucial for wresting Assam from the Congress Party in the 2016 state assembly elections .  Adivasis , who account for almost 20 percent of Assam's voters , ditched the Congress Party in this year's parliamentary elections and supported the BJP giving the party seven seats compared to four in 2009 . The party's Adivasi candidates, Rameshwar Teli and Kamakhya Prasad Tasa, trounced Congress MPs in Dibrugarh and Jorhat .  The BJP's vote-share rose to 36.6 percent from 16.21 percent thanks to Adivasis - which also explains the BJP's muscular response to the December 23 massacre .  In a sense Bodos were tempting fate for a long time . They constitute barely six percent of Assam's 33 million population but want half of the state for themselves . They chose the path of terror way back in 1987 with the slogan ""Divide Assam 50-50"" leaving behind a trail of murder and mayhem .  The first tripartite peace treaty between the federal government, state government and Bodos was signed in 1993 but it collapsed under the weight of its own contradictions . Another accord signed in 2003 resulted in the Bodo Territorial Autonomous District (BTAD) giving them considerable autonomy .  BTAD covering around 8,795 square-km area was given to Bodos on a platter although they comprised only 20 percent of the population in BTAD .  The rest are predominantly Muslims - many of whom are migrants from Bangladesh - and Adivasis .  Bodos floated a political party called Bodoland People's Front (BPF) to administer BTAD , but armed groups, such as Bodo Liberation Tigers (BLT) and NDFB with their extremist-supremacist agenda, called the shots .  It was a bizarre case of 20 percent ruling over 80 percent!  Because Bodos didn't enjoy numerical majority , they resorted to ethnic cleansing . And whether their targets were Muslims or Adivasis , Bodos invariably inflicted more casualties than they suffered primarily because they didn't surrender their arms as they were supposed to after the 2003 accord .  Now the army's brief is to defang NDFB by snatching their guns before eliminating them .  The political motive behind the crackdown is crystal clear . Even otherwise, Singh, the interior minister, is increasingly realising the consequences of armed groups having a free run . Earlier this month he flew to Raipur, capital of Chattisgarh state , after Maoists killed 14 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) soldiers in cold blood .  Singh wanted to visit the ambush site about 450km from Raipur . But security forces warned him that Maoists were capable of bringing down his helicopter! So Singh couldn't make his way to the blood-soaked Ground Zero literally in the centre of India - a sad commentary on a nuclear nation's internal security scenario .","webis-editorials-16"

Or it can always be rescued with ""efficiency savings"" (everyone, for the past decade) .  Meanwhile six hospitals have declared ""major incidents"" (which admittedly have a broad definition under NHS guidance) . Accident and emergency delivery is at its worst for a decade . There is a chronic shortage of A&E; doctors and beds . The NHS boss, Simon Stevens, lets not a month pass without demanding money with menaces from ministers, and usually getting it . His doctors, long adept at financial terrorism, have the politicians by the short hairs . The result is political panic .  When any service is free , demand is unlimited . Aneurin Bevan feared the NHS would put doctors out of work as people got richer and less ill . He was wrong . As they got rich they lived longer and demanded more care . Even where care costs money , as in America, demand soars . The NHS needs 5% more cash a year in real terms to meet rising demand , without improvement . There is no way this can continue indefinitely .  So what happens? Where demand is unlimited , supply must be rationed somehow . As economists know , if it is not rationed by payment - as in most insurance - based health services - it is rationed ""by congestion"", by queueing . That is precisely what is now happening in the NHS . The service worsens, the rich move to private insurance while the poor queue, for hours, days, months . Britain's cancer performance shows the result . More Britons die of cancer delays than in insurance-based health services .  The NHS frontline - surgeries and A&E; departments - are crippled by the strain of trivial visits for minor injuries, repeat prescriptions or just lonely people and confused immigrants .  There is no way this can be sustained sufficiently or efficiently . Desperate attempts at internal pricing have led hospital trust A&E; departments to close because they lose money . They cannot charge or turn away even drunks and nuisance patients .  More and more doctors are now pleading for payment for frontline treatments, recoverable in certain cases . There is no other way any government can restore 24-hour care and a ""personal"" GP service . Rationing by payment may offend tradition , but rationing by chaos is cruel . Britain is just one step away from a network of private A&E; centres . That would be a catastrophe for NHS staffing .

"136-iwasradicalisedbyaneonazigroup.txt","I was radicalised by a neo-Nazi group. It could just have easily been Isis.  It wasn't long after my 13th birthday that I descended into a spiral of heavy drug and alcohol abuse . It wasn't long after the abuse began that I met Mal, aged 29 . It wasn't that I hadn't learned my wrongs from rights, more that they didn't matter to the group of kids I then found myself around .  Grades or sporting prowess accounted for nothing . Instead , accomplishment was measured by something that might actually be achievable : criminal records and the ability to tolerate copious amounts of drugs . Brownie points were awarded for any period of incarceration , be it in a prison cell or psychiatric facility .  Mal's age alone was enough to earn him a significant amount of street cred in our misfit group of teenage boys , yet it was his history of extreme violence that ensured his approval rating was sky high . He was not just an incredibly violent man, but apparently belonged to a group of them . This made him even more attractive .  Mal was a member of a then-notorious neo-Nazi organisation with a track record of serious criminal activity . He regularly turned up at whatever suburban park or abandoned house we found ourselves in as we sought to consume drugs and booze away from prying eyes . I didn't find it at all odd that a man pushing 30 was interested in hanging out with a bunch of delinquent teens . The more drunk we became , the more compelling his violent stories seemed .  One night Mal invited me to tag along to one of the group's semi-regular gatherings . As I listened to one of the speakers rally his audience against the ""foreign invaders"" , I was immediately hooked . It was not I that had problems , I was told , it was people of another skin colour .  The confusion that had been my constant companion , now viewed through this extremist lens, had suddenly become both figuratively and literally black and white . No longer was I to blame for anything . I didn't need to look at my part in my own downward spiral , as teachers, family members and police kept telling me . All life's troubles , it seemed , were the doing of non-whites .  It was a relief to no longer feel responsible for my own - and others' - suffering, but better than that , I was now being called upon to be a vital part of ""the solution"" . It is , I imagine , the same sentiment a potential jihadist feels when he or she foolishly believes that they're being righteously called upon to fight for the creation of an Islamic state , as if that might fix what are largely personal troubles .  I became part of a group that would drive around in the leader's ageing hatchback , plastering racist posters on walls and telegraph poles calling for action against the ""Asian invasion"" . Too dysfunctional to stage any coordinated sort of attack, our race war consisted of nothing more than starting fights with non-whites who were minding their own business . Since we were always heavily intoxicated, more often than not our victims survived the attacks in far better shape than we did .  Unlike today , when a disenfranchised youth has a raft of violent ideologies to be swept up in , it was then my pure fortune that my only real option for extremist activity was this poorly led group . Ongoing action by Asio and the now-defunct special branch of the NSW police and, mostly, the self-implosion of key individuals in the group , meant that by the time I joined it was only a shadow of its former strength .  Thanks to strong family support together with professional help, I was able to leave the group and its racist ideology well behind . I was eventually diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder following a case of long-term bullying at school . While that has helped me understand what drove me to this group , it is clear that all the factors that leave a young person susceptible to extremist ideology - poverty, lack of education, inadequate mental health support services and general social exclusion - still widely exist across western nations .  I cringe when I hear our political leadership deliver yet another speech extolling a commitment to fighting extremism , yet in almost the time it takes to draw their next breath , go on to announce cuts to community services groups, the kind of organisations whose roles are vital in addressing the risk factors that leave one vulnerable to extremism .  It's not that Orwell was completely off the mark when he said ""people sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf"" . It is just that by the time the men with guns are needed , the radicalisation process has already happened .  This is a process that cannot be stopped by sending troops to regions where most locals couldn't even spell ""Australia"" , let alone have the capacity or even the desire to attack us . The clear and present danger today , as events from Oklahoma City through most recently to Paris have shown , is that the biggest threats are of the home-grown variety .  The real frontline in the war on terror is to be found in our education and mental health services . Until such institutions are resourced as freely as our military is , then extremists will be here to stay .","webis-editorials-16"

When it comes to auto loans, and other monthly installment loans, I am sure the consumers are aware of the debt and who it is payable to, unless sold. This could be a huge regulatory burden on creditors that don't sell loans and follow current collection laws. After all, do very many people pay monthly payment to the same people for several months and them forget they owe the debt. All laws should not apply to all creditors.","cornell-erulemaking"

"32_2004",":<strong>October 13, 2004</strong>  <strong>The Third Bush-Kerry Presidential Debate</strong>  THIRD PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES' DEBATE ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY, TEMPE, ARIZONA  SPEAKERS:  GEORGE W. BUSH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  U. S. SENATOR JOHN F. KERRY (MA) DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE  BOB SCHIEFFER CBS ANCHOR   SCHIEFFER: Good evening from Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona. I'm Bob Schieffer of CBS News. I want to welcome you to the third and last of the 2004 debates between President George Bush and Senator John Kerry. As Jim Lehrer told you before the first one, these debates are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.  Tonight the topic will be domestic affairs, but the format will be the same as that first debate. I'll moderate our discussion under detailed rules agreed to by the candidates, but the questions and the areas to be covered were chosen by me. I have not told the candidates or anyone else what they are.  To refresh your memory on the rules, I will ask a question. The candidate is allowed two minutes to answer. His opponent then has a minute and a half to offer a rebuttal.  At my discretion, I can extend the discussion by offering each candidate an additional 30 seconds.  A green light will come on to signal the candidate has 30 seconds left. A yellow light signals 15 seconds left. A red light means five seconds left.  There is also a buzzer, if it is needed.  The candidates may not question each other directly. There are no opening statements, but there will be two-minute closing statements.  There is an audience here tonight, but they have agreed to remain silent, except for right now, when they join me in welcoming President George Bush and Senator John Kerry.  (APPLAUSE)  Gentlemen, welcome to you both.  By coin toss, the first question goes to Senator Kerry.  Senator, I want to set the stage for this discussion by asking the question that I think hangs over all of our politics today and is probably on the minds of many people watching this debate tonight.  And that is, will our children and grandchildren ever live in a world as safe and secure as the world in which we grew up?  KERRY: Well, first of all, Bob, thank you for moderating tonight. Thank you, Arizona State, for welcoming us.  And thank you to the Presidential Commission for undertaking this enormous task. We're proud to be here.  Mr. President, I'm glad to be here with you again to share similarities and differences with the American people.  Will we ever be safe and secure again? Yes. We absolutely must be. That's the goal.  Now, how do we achieve it is the most critical component of it.  I believe that this president, regrettably, rushed us into a war, made decisions about foreign policy, pushed alliances away. And, as a result, America is now bearing this extraordinary burden where we are not as safe as we ought to be.  The measurement is not: Are we safer? The measurement is: Are we as safe as we ought to be? And there are a host of options that this president had available to him, like making sure that at all our ports in America containers are inspected. Only 95 percent of them -- 95 percent come in today uninspected. That's not good enough.  People who fly on airplanes today, the cargo hold is not X-rayed, but the baggage is. That's not good enough. Firehouses don't have enough firefighters in them. Police officers are being cut from the streets of America because the president decided to cut the COPS program.  So we can do a better job of homeland security. I can do a better job of waging a smarter, more effective war on terror and guarantee that we will go after the terrorists.  I will hunt them down, and we'll kill them, we'll capture them. We'll do whatever is necessary to be safe.  But I pledge this to you, America: I will do it in the way that Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan and John Kennedy and others did, where we build the strongest alliances, where the world joins together, where we have the best intelligence and where we are able, ultimately, to be more safe and secure.  SCHIEFFER: Mr. President, you have 90 seconds. BUSH: Bob, thank you very much. I want to thank Arizona State as well.  Yes, we can be safe and secure, if we stay on the offense against the terrorists and if we spread freedom and liberty around the world.  I have got a comprehensive strategy to not only chase down the Al Qaida, wherever it exists -- and we're making progress; three-quarters of Al Qaida leaders have been brought to justice -- but to make sure that countries that harbor terrorists are held to account.  As a result of securing ourselves and ridding the Taliban out of Afghanistan, the Afghan people had elections this weekend. And the first voter was a 19-year-old woman. Think about that. Freedom is on the march.  We held to account a terrorist regime in Saddam Hussein.  In other words, in order to make sure we're secure, there must be a comprehensive plan. My opponent just this weekend talked about how terrorism could be reduced to a nuisance, comparing it to prostitution, illegal gambling. I think that attitude and that point of view is dangerous. I don't think you can secure America for the long run if you don't have a comprehensive view as to how to defeat these people.  At home, we'll do everything we can to protect the homeland. I signed the homeland security bill to better align our assets and resources. My opponent voted against it.  We're doing everything we can to protect our borders and ports.  But absolutely we can be secure in the long run. It just takes good, strong leadership.  SCHIEFFER: Anything to add, Senator Kerry? KERRY: Yes. When the president had an opportunity to capture or kill Osama bin Laden, he took his focus off of them, outsourced the job to Afghan warlords, and Osama bin Laden escaped. Six months after he said Osama bin Laden must be caught dead or alive, this president was asked, ""Where is Osama bin Laden? "" He said, ""I don't know. I don't really think about him very much. I'm not that concerned. ""  We need a president who stays deadly focused on the real war on terror.  SCHIEFFER: Mr. President? BUSH: Gosh, I just don't think I ever said I'm not worried about Osama bin Laden. It's kind of one of those exaggerations. Of course we're worried about Osama bin Laden. We're on the hunt after Osama bin Laden. We're using every asset at our disposal to get Osama bin Laden.  My opponent said this war is a matter of intelligence and law enforcement. No, this war is a matter of using every asset at our disposal to keep the American people protected.  SCHIEFFER: New question, Mr. President, to you. We are talking about protecting ourselves from the unexpected, but the flu season is suddenly upon us. Flu kills thousands of people every year.  Suddenly we find ourselves with a severe shortage of flu vaccine. How did that happen?  BUSH: Bob, we relied upon a company out of England to provide about half of the flu vaccines for the United States citizen, and it turned out that the vaccine they were producing was contaminated. And so we took the right action and didn't allow contaminated medicine into our country. We're working with Canada to hopefully -- that they'll produce a -- help us realize the vaccine necessary to make sure our citizens have got flu vaccinations during this upcoming season. My call to our fellow Americans is if you're healthy, if you're younger, don't get a flu shot this year. Help us prioritize those who need to get the flu shot, the elderly and the young.  The CDC, responsible for health in the United States, is setting those priorities and is allocating the flu vaccine accordingly.  I haven't gotten a flu shot, and I don't intend to because I want to make sure those who are most vulnerable get treated.  We have a problem with litigation in the United States of America. Vaccine manufacturers are worried about getting sued, and therefore they have backed off from providing this kind of vaccine.  One of the reasons I'm such a strong believer in legal reform is so that people aren't afraid of producing a product that is necessary for the health of our citizens and then end up getting sued in a court of law.  But the best thing we can do now, Bob, given the circumstances with the company in England is for those of us who are younger and healthy, don't get a flu shot.  SCHIEFFER: Senator Kerry? KERRY: This really underscores the problem with the American health-care system. It's not working for the American family. And it's gotten worse under President Bush over the course of the last years. Five million Americans have lost their health insurance in this country. You've got about a million right here in Arizona, just shy, 950,000, who have no health insurance at all. 82,000 Arizonians lost their health insurance under President Bush's watch. 223,000 kids in Arizona have no health insurance at all.  All across our country -- go to Ohio, 1. 4 million Ohioans have no health insurance, 114,000 of them lost it under President Bush; Wisconsin, 82,000 Wisconsinites lost it under President Bush.  This president has turned his back on the wellness of America. And there is no system. In fact, it's starting to fall apart not because of lawsuits -- though they are a problem, and John Edwards and I are committed to fixing them -- but because of the larger issue that we don't cover Americans.  Children across our country don't have health care. We're the richest country on the face of the planet, the only industrialized nation in the world not to do it.  I have a plan to cover all Americans. We're going to make it affordable and accessible. We're going to let everybody buy into the same health-care plan senators and congressmen give themselves.  SCHIEFFER: Mr. President, would you like to add something? BUSH: I would. Thank you. I want to remind people listening tonight that a plan is not a litany of complaints, and a plan is not to lay out programs that you can't pay for.  He just said he wants everybody to be able to buy in to the same plan that senators and congressmen get. That costs the government $7,700 per family. If every family in America signed up, like the senator suggested, if would cost us $5 trillion over 10 years.  It's an empty promise. It's called bait and switch.  SCHIEFFER: Time's up. BUSH: Thank you. KERRY: Actually, it's not an empty promise. It's really interesting, because the president used that very plan as a reason for seniors to accept his prescription drug plan. He said, if it's good enough for the congressmen and senators to have choice, seniors ought to have choice.  What we do is we have choice. I choose Blue Cross/Blue Shield. Other senators, other congressmen choose other programs.  But the fact is, we're going to help Americans be able to buy into it. Those that can afford it are going to buy in themselves. We're not giving this away for nothing.  SCHIEFFER: All right. Senator Kerry, a new question. Let's talk about economic security. You pledged during the last debate that you would not raise taxes on those making less than $200,000 a year. But the price of everything is going up, and we all know it. Health-care costs, as you are talking about, is skyrocketing, the cost of the war.  My question is, how can you or any president, whoever is elected next time, keep that pledge without running this country deeper into debt and passing on more of the bills that we're running up to our children?  KERRY: I'll tell you exactly how I can do it: by reinstating what President Bush took away, which is called pay as you go. During the 1990s, we had pay-as-you-go rules. If you were going to pass something in the Congress, you had to show where you are going to pay for it and how.  President Bush has taken -- he's the only president in history to do this. He's also the only president in 72 years to lose jobs -- 1. 6 million jobs lost. He's the only president to have incomes of families go down for the last three years; the only president to see exports go down; the only president to see the lowest level of business investment in our country as it is today.  Now, I'm going to reverse that. I'm going to change that. We're going to restore the fiscal discipline we had in the 1990s.  Every plan that I have laid out -- my health-care plan, my plan for education, my plan for kids to be able to get better college loans -- I've shown exactly how I'm going to pay for those.  And we start -- we don't do it exclusively -- but we start by rolling back George Bush's unaffordable tax cut for the wealthiest people, people earning more than $200,000 a year, and we pass, hopefully, the McCain-Kerry Commission which identified some $60 billion that we can get.  We shut the loophole which has American workers actually subsidizing the loss of their own job. They just passed an expansion of that loophole in the last few days: $43 billion of giveaways, including favors to the oil and gas industry and the people importing ceiling fans from China.  I'm going to stand up and fight for the American worker. And I am going to do it in a way that's fiscally sound. I show how I pay for the health care, how we pay for the education.  I have a manufacturing jobs credit. We pay for it by shutting that loophole overseas. We raise the student loans. I pay for it by changing the relationship with the banks.  This president has never once vetoed one bill; the first president in a hundred years not to do that.  SCHIEFFER: Mr. President? BUSH: Well, his rhetoric doesn't match his record. He been a senator for 20 years. He voted to increase taxes 98 times. When they tried to reduce taxes, he voted against that 127 times. He talks about being a fiscal conservative, or fiscally sound, but he voted over -- he voted 277 times to waive the budget caps, which would have cost the taxpayers $4. 2 trillion.  He talks about PAYGO. I'll tell you what PAYGO means, when you're a senator from Massachusetts, when you're a colleague of Ted Kennedy, pay go means: You pay, and he goes ahead and spends.  He's proposed $2. 2 trillion of new spending, and yet the so-called tax on the rich, which is also a tax on many small-business owners in America, raises $600 million by our account -- billion, $800 billion by his account.  There is a tax gap. And guess who usually ends up filling the tax gap? The middle class.  I propose a detailed budget, Bob. I sent up my budget man to the Congress, and he says, here's how we're going to reduce the deficit in half by five years. It requires pro-growth policies that grow our economy and fiscal sanity in the halls of Congress.  SCHIEFFER: Let's go to a new question, Mr. President. Two minutes. And let's continue on jobs. You know, there are all kind of statistics out there, but I want to bring it down to an individual.  Mr. President, what do you say to someone in this country who has lost his job to someone overseas who's being paid a fraction of what that job paid here in the United States?  BUSH: I'd say, Bob, I've got policies to continue to grow our economy and create the jobs of the 21st century. And here's some help for you to go get an education. Here's some help for you to go to a community college. We've expanded trade adjustment assistance. We want to help pay for you to gain the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century.  You know, there's a lot of talk about how to keep the economy growing. We talk about fiscal matters. But perhaps the best way to keep jobs here in America and to keep this economy growing is to make sure our education system works.  I went to Washington to solve problems. And I saw a problem in the public education system in America. They were just shuffling too many kids through the system, year after year, grade after grade, without learning the basics.  And so we said: Let's raise the standards. We're spending more money, but let's raise the standards and measure early and solve problems now, before it's too late.  No, education is how to help the person who's lost a job. Education is how to make sure we've got a workforce that's productive and competitive.  Got four more years, I've got more to do to continue to raise standards, to continue to reward teachers and school districts that are working, to emphasize math and science in the classrooms, to continue to expand Pell Grants to make sure that people have an opportunity to start their career with a college diploma.  And so the person you talked to, I say, here's some help, here's some trade adjustment assistance money for you to go a community college in your neighborhood, a community college which is providing the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century. And that's what I would say to that person.  SCHIEFFER: Senator Kerry? KERRY: I want you to notice how the president switched away from jobs and started talking about education principally. Let me come back in one moment to that, but I want to speak for a second, if I can, to what the president said about fiscal responsibility.  Being lectured by the president on fiscal responsibility is a little bit like Tony Soprano talking to me about law and order in this country.  (LAUGHTER)  This president has taken a $5. 6 trillion surplus and turned it into deficits as far as the eye can see. Health-care costs for the average American have gone up 64 percent; tuitions have gone up 35 percent; gasoline prices up 30 percent; Medicare premiums went up 17 percent a few days ago; prescription drugs are up 12 percent a year.  But guess what, America? The wages of Americans have gone down. The jobs that are being created in Arizona right now are paying about $13,700 less than the jobs that we're losing.  And the president just walks on by this problem. The fact is that he's cut job-training money. $1 billion was cut. They only added a little bit back this year because it's an election year.  They've cut the Pell Grants and the Perkins loans to help kids be able to go to college.  They've cut the training money. They've wound up not even extending unemployment benefits and not even extending health care to those people who are unemployed.  I'm going to do those things, because that's what's right in America: Help workers to transition in every respect.  SCHIEFFER: New question to you, Senator Kerry, two minutes. And it's still on jobs. You know, many experts say that a president really doesn't have much control over jobs. For example, if someone invents a machine that does the work of five people, that's progress. That's not the president's fault. So I ask you, is it fair to blame the administration entirely for this loss of jobs?  KERRY: I don't blame them entirely for it. I blame the president for the things the president could do that has an impact on it. Outsourcing is going to happen. I've acknowledged that in union halls across the country. I've had shop stewards stand up and say, ""Will you promise me you're going to stop all this outsourcing? ""And I've looked them in the eye and I've said, ""No, I can't do that. ""  What I can promise you is that I will make the playing field as fair as possible, that I will, for instance, make certain that with respect to the tax system that you as a worker in America are not subsidizing the loss of your job.  Today, if you're an American business, you actually get a benefit for going overseas. You get to defer your taxes.  So if you're looking at a competitive world, you say to yourself, ""Hey, I do better overseas than I do here in America. ""  That's not smart. I don't want American workers subsidizing the loss of their own job. And when I'm president, we're going to shut that loophole in a nanosecond and we're going to use that money to lower corporate tax rates in America for all corporations, 5 percent. And we're going to have a manufacturing jobs credit and a job hiring credit so we actually help people be able to hire here.  The second thing that we can do is provide a fair trade playing field. This president didn't stand up for Boeing when Airbus was violating international rules and subsidies. He discovered Boeing during the course of this campaign after I'd been talking about it for months.  The fact is that the president had an opportunity to stand up and take on China for currency manipulation. There are companies that wanted to petition the administration. They were told: Don't even bother; we're not going to listen to it.  The fact is that there have been markets shut to us that we haven't stood up and fought for. I'm going to fight for a fair trade playing field for the American worker. And I will fight for the American worker just as hard as I fight for my own job. That's what the American worker wants. And if we do that, we can have an impact.  Plus, we need fiscal discipline. Restore fiscal discipline, we'll do a lot better.  SCHIEFFER: Mr. President? BUSH: Whew! Let me start with the Pell Grants. In his last litany of misstatements. He said we cut Pell Grants. We've increased Pell Grants by a million students. That's a fact.  You know, he talks to the workers. Let me talk to the workers.  You've got more money in your pocket as a result of the tax relief we passed and he opposed.  If you have a child, you got a $1,000 child credit. That's money in your pocket.  If you're married, we reduced the marriage penalty. The code ought to encourage marriage, not discourage marriage.  We created a 10 percent bracket to help lower-income Americans. A family of four making $40,000 received about $1,700 in tax relief.  It's your money. The way my opponent talks, he said, ""We're going to spend the government's money. ""No, we're spending your money. And when you have more money in your pocket, you're able to better afford things you want.  I believe the role of government is to stand side by side with our citizens to help them realize their dreams, not tell citizens how to live their lives.  My opponent talks about fiscal sanity. His record in the United States Senate does not match his rhetoric.  He voted to increase taxes 98 times and to bust the budget 277 times.  SCHIEFFER: Senator Kerry? KERRY: Bob, anybody can play with these votes. Everybody knows that. I have supported or voted for tax cuts over 600 times. I broke with my party in order to balance the budget, and Ronald Reagan signed into law the tax cut that we voted for. I voted for IRA tax cuts. I voted for small-business tax cuts.  But you know why the Pell Grants have gone up in their numbers? Because more people qualify for them because they don't have money.  But they're not getting the $5,100 the president promised them. They're getting less money.  We have more people who qualify. That's not what we want.  BUSH: Senator, no one's playing with your votes. You voted to increase taxes 98 times. When they voted -- when they proposed reducing taxes, you voted against it 126 times. He voted to violate the budget cap 277 times. You know, there's a main stream in American politics and you sit right on the far left bank. As a matter of fact, your record is such that Ted Kennedy, your colleague, is the conservative senator from Massachusetts.  SCHIEFFER: Mr. President, let's get back to economic issues. But let's shift to some other questions here. Both of you are opposed to gay marriage. But to understand how you have come to that conclusion, I want to ask you a more basic question. Do you believe homosexuality is a choice?  BUSH: You know, Bob, I don't know. I just don't know. I do know that we have a choice to make in America and that is to treat people with tolerance and respect and dignity. It's important that we do that. And I also know in a free society people, consenting adults can live the way they want to live.  And that's to be honored.  But as we respect someone's rights, and as we profess tolerance, we shouldn't change -- or have to change -- our basic views on the sanctity of marriage. I believe in the sanctity of marriage. I think it's very important that we protect marriage as an institution, between a man and a woman.  I proposed a constitutional amendment. The reason I did so was because I was worried that activist judges are actually defining the definition of marriage, and the surest way to protect marriage between a man and woman is to amend the Constitution.  It has also the benefit of allowing citizens to participate in the process. After all, when you amend the Constitution, state legislatures must participate in the ratification of the Constitution.  I'm deeply concerned that judges are making those decisions and not the citizenry of the United States. You know, Congress passed a law called DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act.  My opponent was against it. It basically protected states from the action of one state to another. It also defined marriage as between a man and woman.  But I'm concerned that that will get overturned. And if it gets overturned, then we'll end up with marriage being defined by courts, and I don't think that's in our nation's interests.  SCHIEFFER: Senator Kerry? KERRY: We're all God's children, Bob. And I think if you were to talk to Dick Cheney's daughter, who is a lesbian, she would tell you that she's being who she was, she's being who she was born as. I think if you talk to anybody, it's not choice. I've met people who struggled with this for years, people who were in a marriage because they were living a sort of convention, and they struggled with it.  And I've met wives who are supportive of their husbands or vice versa when they finally sort of broke out and allowed themselves to live who they were, who they felt God had made them.  I think we have to respect that.  The president and I share the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman. I believe that. I believe marriage is between a man and a woman.  But I also believe that because we are the United States of America, we're a country with a great, unbelievable Constitution, with rights that we afford people, that you can't discriminate in the workplace. You can't discriminate in the rights that you afford people.  You can't disallow someone the right to visit their partner in a hospital. You have to allow people to transfer property, which is why I'm for partnership rights and so forth.  Now, with respect to DOMA and the marriage laws, the states have always been able to manage those laws. And they're proving today, every state, that they can manage them adequately.  SCHIEFFER: Senator Kerry, a new question for you. The New York Times reports that some Catholic archbishops are telling their church members that it would be a sin to vote for a candidate like you because you support a woman's right to choose an abortion and unlimited stem-cell research.  What is your reaction to that?  KERRY: I respect their views. I completely respect their views. I am a Catholic. And I grew up learning how to respect those views. But I disagree with them, as do many. I believe that I can't legislate or transfer to another American citizen my article of faith. What is an article of faith for me is not something that I can legislate on somebody who doesn't share that article of faith.  I believe that choice is a woman's choice. It's between a woman, God and her doctor. And that's why I support that.  Now, I will not allow somebody to come in and change Roe v. Wade.  The president has never said whether or not he would do that. But we know from the people he's tried to appoint to the court he wants to.  I will not. I will defend the right of Roe v. Wade.  Now, with respect to religion, you know, as I said, I grew up a Catholic. I was an altar boy. I know that throughout my life this has made a difference to me.  And as President Kennedy said when he ran for president, he said, ""I'm not running to be a Catholic president. I'm running to be a president who happens to be Catholic. ""  My faith affects everything that I do, in truth. There's a great passage of the Bible that says, ""What does it mean, my brother, to say you have faith if there are no deeds? Faith without works is dead. ""  And I think that everything you do in public life has to be guided by your faith, affected by your faith, but without transferring it in any official way to other people.  That's why I fight against poverty. That's why I fight to clean up the environment and protect this earth.  That's why I fight for equality and justice. All of those things come out of that fundamental teaching and belief of faith.  But I know this, that President Kennedy in his inaugural address told all of us that here on Earth, God's work must truly be our own. And that's what we have to -- I think that's the test of public service.  SCHIEFFER: Mr. President? BUSH: I think it's important to promote a culture of life. I think a hospitable society is a society where every being counts and every person matters. I believe the ideal world is one in which every child is protected in law and welcomed to life. I understand there's great differences on this issue of abortion, but I believe reasonable people can come together and put good law in place that will help reduce the number of abortions. Take, for example, the ban on partial birth abortion. It's a brutal practice. People from both political parties came together in the halls of Congress and voted overwhelmingly to ban that practice. It made a lot of sense. My opponent, in that he's out of the mainstream, voted against that law.  What I'm saying is, is that as we promote life and promote a culture of life, surely there are ways we can work together to reduce the number of abortions: continue to promote adoption laws -- it's a great alternative to abortion -- continue to fund and promote maternity group homes; I will continue to promote abstinence programs.  The last debate, my opponent said his wife was involved with those programs. That's great. I appreciate that very much. All of us ought to be involved with programs that provide a viable alternative to abortion.  SCHIEFFER: Mr. President, let's have a new question. It goes to you. And let's get back to economic issues. Health insurance costs have risen over 36 percent over the last four years according to The Washington Post. We're paying more. We're getting less.  I would like to ask you: Who bears responsibility for this? Is it the government? Is it the insurance companies? Is it the lawyers? Is it the doctors? Is it the administration?  BUSH: Gosh, I sure hope it's not the administration. There's a -- no, look, there's a systemic problem. Health-care costs are on the rise because the consumers are not involved in the decision-making process. Most health-care costs are covered by third parties. And therefore, the actual user of health care is not the purchaser of health care. And there's no market forces involved with health care.  It's one of the reasons I'm a strong believer in what they call health savings accounts. These are accounts that allow somebody to buy a low-premium, high-deductible catastrophic plan and couple it with tax-free savings. Businesses can contribute, employees can contribute on a contractual basis. But this is a way to make sure people are actually involved with the decision-making process on health care.  Secondly, I do believe the lawsuits -- I don't believe, I know -- that the lawsuits are causing health-care costs to rise in America. That's why I'm such a strong believer in medical liability reform.  In the last debate, my opponent said those lawsuits only caused the cost to go up by 1 percent. Well, he didn't include the defensive practice of medicine that costs the federal government some $28 billion a year and costs our society between $60 billion and $100 billion a year.  Thirdly, one of the reasons why there's still high cost in medicine is because this is -- they don't use any information technology. It's like if you looked at the -- it's the equivalent of the buggy and horse days, compared to other industries here in America.  And so, we've got to introduce high technology into health care. We're beginning to do it. We're changing the language. We want there to be electronic medical records to cut down on error, as well as reduce cost.  People tell me that when the health-care field is fully integrated with information technology, it'll wring some 20 percent of the cost out of the system.  And finally, moving generic drugs to the market quicker.  And so, those are four ways to help control the costs in health care.  SCHIEFFER: Senator Kerry? KERRY: The reason health-care costs are getting higher, one of the principal reasons is that this administration has stood in the way of common-sense efforts that would have reduced the costs. Let me give you a prime example. In the Senate we passed the right of Americans to import drugs from Canada. But the president and his friends took it out in the House, and now you don't have that right. The president blocked you from the right to have less expensive drugs from Canada.  We also wanted Medicare to be able to negotiate bulk purchasing. The VA does that. The VA provides lower-cost drugs to our veterans. We could have done that in Medicare.  Medicare is paid for by the American taxpayer. Medicare belongs to you. Medicare is for seniors, who many of them are on fixed income, to lift them out of poverty.  But rather than help you, the taxpayer, have lower cost, rather than help seniors have less expensive drugs, the president made it illegal -- illegal -- for Medicare to actually go out and bargain for lower prices.  Result: $139 billion windfall profit to the drug companies coming out of your pockets. That's a large part of your 17 percent increase in Medicare premiums.  When I'm president, I'm sending that back to Congress and we're going to get a real prescription drug benefit.  Now, we also have people sicker because they don't have health insurance. So whether it's diabetes or cancer, they come to hospitals later and it costs America more.  We got to have health care for all Americans.  SCHIEFFER: Go ahead, Mr. President. BUSH: I think it's important, since he talked about the Medicare plan, has he been in the United States Senate for 20 years? He has no record on reforming of health care. No record at all. He introduced some 300 bills and he's passed five.  No record of leadership.  I came to Washington to solve problems. I was deeply concerned about seniors having to choose between prescription drugs and food. And so I led. And in 2006, our seniors will get a prescription drug coverage in Medicare.  SCHIEFFER: Senator Kerry? Thirty seconds. KERRY: Once again, the president is misleading America. I've actually passed 56 individual bills that I've personally written and, in addition to that, and not always under my name, there is amendments on certain bills. But more importantly, with respect to the question of no record, I helped write -- I did write, I was one of the original authors of the early childhood health care and the expansion of health care that we did in the middle of the 1990s. And I'm very proud of that.  So the president's wrong.  SCHIEFFER: Let me direct the next question to you, Senator Kerry, and again, let's stay on health care. You have, as you have proposed and as the president has commented on tonight, proposed a massive plan to extend health-care coverage to children. You're also talking about the government picking up a big part of the catastrophic bills that people get at the hospital.  And you have said that you can pay for this by rolling back the president's tax cut on the upper 2 percent.  You heard the president say earlier tonight that it's going to cost a whole lot more money than that.  I'd just ask you, where are you going to get the money?  KERRY: Well, two leading national news networks have both said the president's characterization of my health-care plan is incorrect. One called it fiction. The other called it untrue. The fact is that my health-care plan, America, is very simple. It gives you the choice. I don't force you to do anything. It's not a government plan. The government doesn't require you to do anything. You choose your doctor. You choose your plan.  If you don't want to take the offer of the plan that I want to put forward, you don't have do. You can keep what you have today, keep a high deductible, keep high premiums, keep a high co-pay, keep low benefits.  But I got a better plan. And I don't think a lot of people are going to want to keep what they have today.  Here's what I do: We take over Medicaid children from the states so that every child in America is covered. And in exchange, if the states want to -- they're not forced to, they can choose to -- they cover individuals up to 300 percent of poverty. It's their choice.  I think they'll choose it, because it's a net plus of $5 billion to them.  We allow you -- if you choose to, you don't have to -- but we give you broader competition to allow you to buy into the same health care plan that senators and congressmen give themselves. If it's good enough for us, it's good enough for every American. I believe that your health care is just as important as any politician in Washington, D. C.  You want to buy into it, you can. We give you broader competition. That helps lower prices.  In addition to that, we're going to allow people 55 to 64 to buy into Medicare early. And most importantly, we give small business a 50 percent tax credit so that after we lower the costs of health care, they also get, whether they're self-employed or a small business, a lower cost to be able to cover their employees.  Now, what happens is when you begin to get people covered like that -- for instance in diabetes, if you diagnose diabetes early, you could save $50 billion in the health care system of America by avoiding surgery and dialysis. It works. And I'm going to offer it to America.  SCHIEFFER: Mr. President? BUSH: In all due respect, I'm not so sure it's credible to quote leading news organizations about -- oh, never mind. Anyway, let me quote the Lewin report. The Lewin report is a group of folks who are not politically affiliated. They analyzed the senator's plan. It cost $1.2 trillion. The Lewin report accurately noted that there are going to be 20 million people, over 20 million people added to government-controlled health care. It would be the largest increase in government health care ever.  If you raise the Medicaid to 300 percent, it provides an incentive for small businesses not to provide private insurance to their employees. Why should they insure somebody when the government's going to insure it for them?  It's estimated that 8 million people will go from private insurance to government insurance.  We have a fundamental difference of opinion. I think government- run health will lead to poor-quality health, will lead to rationing, will lead to less choice.  Once a health-care program ends up in a line item in the federal government budget, it leads to more controls.  And just look at other countries that have tried to have federally controlled health care. They have poor-quality health care.  Our health-care system is the envy of the world because we believe in making sure that the decisions are made by doctors and patients, not by officials in the nation's capital.  SCHIEFFER: Senator? KERRY: The president just said that government-run health care results in poor quality. Now, maybe that explains why he hasn't fully funded the VA and the VA hospital is having trouble and veterans are complaining. Maybe that explains why Medicare patients are complaining about being pushed off of Medicare. He doesn't adequately fund it.  But let me just say to America: I am not proposing a government-run program. That's not what I have. I have Blue Cross/Blue Shield. Senators and congressmen have a wide choice. Americans ought to have it too.  SCHIEFFER: Mr. President? BUSH: Talk about the VA: We've increased VA funding by $22 billion in the four years since I've been president. That's twice the amount that my predecessor increased VA funding. Of course we're meeting our obligation to our veterans, and the veterans know that.  We're expanding veterans' health care throughout the country. We're aligning facilities where the veterans live now. Veterans are getting very good health care under my administration, and they will continue to do so during the next four years.  SCHIEFFER: Mr. President, the next question is to you. We all know that Social Security is running out of money, and it has to be fixed. You have proposed to fix it by letting people put some of the money collected to pay benefits into private savings accounts. But the critics are saying that's going to mean finding $1 trillion over the next 10 years to continue paying benefits as those accounts are being set up. So where do you get the money? Are you going to have to increase the deficit by that much over 10 years?  BUSH: First, let me make sure that every senior listening today understands that when we're talking about reforming Social Security, that they'll still get their checks. I remember the 2000 campaign, people said if George W. gets elected, your check will be taken away. Well, people got their checks, and they'll continue to get their checks.  There is a problem for our youngsters, a real problem. And if we don't act today, the problem will be valued in the trillions. And so I think we need to think differently. We'll honor our commitment to our seniors. But for our children and our grandchildren, we need to have a different strategy.  And recognizing that, I called together a group of our fellow citizens to study the issue. It was a committee chaired by the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, a Democrat. And they came up with a variety of ideas for people to look at.  I believe that younger workers ought to be allowed to take some of their own money and put it in a personal savings account, because I understand that they need to get better rates of return than the rates of return being given in the current Social Security trust.  And the compounding rate of interest effect will make it more likely that the Social Security system is solvent for our children and our grandchildren. I will work with Republicans and Democrats. It'll be a vital issue in my second term. It is an issue that I am willing to take on, and so I'll bring Republicans and Democrats together.  And we're of course going to have to consider the costs. But I want to warn my fellow citizens: The cost of doing nothing, the cost of saying the current system is OK, far exceeds the costs of trying to make sure we save the system for our children.  SCHIEFFER: Senator Kerry? KERRY: You just heard the president say that young people ought to be able to take money out of Social Security and put it in their own accounts. Now, my fellow Americans, that's an invitation to disaster.  The CBO said very clearly that if you were to adopt the president's plan, there would be a $2 trillion hole in Social Security, because today's workers pay in to the system for today's retirees. And the CBO said -- that's the Congressional Budget Office; it's bipartisan -- they said that there would have to be a cut in benefits of 25 percent to 40 percent.  Now, the president has never explained to America, ever, hasn't done it tonight, where does the transitional money, that $2 trillion, come from?  He's already got $3 trillion, according to The Washington Post, of expenses that he's put on the line from his convention and the promises of this campaign, none of which are paid for. Not one of them are paid for.  The fact is that the president is driving the largest deficits in American history. He's broken the pay-as-you-go rules.  I have a record of fighting for fiscal responsibility. In 1985, I was one of the first Democrats -- broke with my party. We balanced the budget in the '90s. We paid down the debt for two years.  And that's what we're going to do. We're going to protect Social Security. I will not privatize it. I will not cut the benefits. And we're going to be fiscally responsible. And we will take care of Social Security.  SCHIEFFER: Let me just stay on Social Security with a new question for Senator Kerry, because, Senator Kerry, you have just said you will not cut benefits. Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, says there's no way that Social Security can pay retirees what we have promised them unless we recalibrate.  What he's suggesting, we're going to cut benefits or we're going to have to raise the retirement age. We may have to take some other reform. But if you've just said, you've promised no changes, does that mean you're just going to leave this as a problem, another problem for our children to solve?  KERRY: Not at all. Absolutely not, Bob. This is the same thing we heard -- remember, I appeared on ""Meet the Press"" with Tim Russert in 1990-something. We heard the same thing. We fixed it. In fact, we put together a $5. 6 trillion surplus in the '90s that was for the purpose of saving Social Security. If you take the tax cut that the president of the United States has given -- President Bush gave to Americans in the top 1 percent of America -- just that tax cut that went to the top 1 percent of America would have saved Social Security until the year 2075.  The president decided to give it to the wealthiest Americans in a tax cut. Now, Alan Greenspan, who I think has done a terrific job in monetary policy, supports the president's tax cut. I don't. I support it for the middle class, not that part of it that goes to people earning more than $200,000 a year.  And when I roll it back and we invest in the things that I have talked about to move our economy, we're going to grow sufficiently, it would begin to cut the deficit in half, and we get back to where we were at the end of the 1990s when we balanced the budget and paid down the debt of this country.  Now, we can do that.  Now, if later on after a period of time we find that Social Security is in trouble, we'll pull together the top experts of the country. We'll do exactly what we did in the 1990s. And we'll make whatever adjustment is necessary.  But the first and most important thing is to start creating jobs in America. The jobs the president is creating pay $9,000 less than the jobs that we're losing. And this is the first president in 72 years to preside over an economy in America that has lost jobs, 1. 6 million jobs.  Eleven other presidents -- six Democrats and five Republicans -- had wars, had recessions, had great difficulties; none of them lost jobs the way this president has.  I have a plan to put America back to work. And if we're fiscally responsible and put America back to work, we're going to fix Social Security.  SCHIEFFER: Mr. President? BUSH: He forgot to tell you he voted to tax Social Security benefits more than one time. I didn't hear any plan to fix Social Security. I heard more of the same. He talks about middle-class tax cuts. That's exactly where the tax cuts went. Most of the tax cuts went to low- and middle-income Americans. And now the tax code is more fair. Twenty percent of the upper-income people pay about 80 percent of the taxes in America today because of how we structured the tax cuts. People listening out there know the benefits of the tax cuts we passed. If you have a child, you got tax relief. If you're married, you got tax relief. If you pay any tax at all, you got tax relief. All of which was opposed by my opponent.  And the tax relief was important to spur consumption and investment to get us out of this recession.  People need to remember: Six months prior to my arrival, the stock market started to go down. And it was one of the largest declines in our history. And then we had a recession and we got attacked, which cost us 1 million jobs.  But we acted. I led the Congress. We passed tax relief. And now this economy is growing. We added 1. 9 million new jobs over the last 13 months.  Sure, there's more work to do. But the way to make sure our economy grows is not to raise taxes on small-business owners. It's not to increase the scope of the federal government. It's to make sure we have fiscal sanity and keep taxes low.  SCHIEFFER: Let's go to a new question, Mr. President. I got more e-mail this week on this question than any other question. And it is about immigration.  I'm told that at least 8,000 people cross our borders illegally every day. Some people believe this is a security issue, as you know. Some believe it's an economic issue. Some see it as a human-rights issue.  How do you see it? And what do we need to do about it?  BUSH: I see it as a serious problem. I see it as a security issue, I see it as an economic issue, and I see it as a human-rights issue. We're increasing the border security of the United States. We've got 1,000 more Border Patrol agents on the southern border.  We're using new equipment. We're using unmanned vehicles to spot people coming across.  And we'll continue to do so over the next four years. It's a subject I'm very familiar with. After all, I was a border governor for a while.  Many people are coming to this country for economic reasons. They're coming here to work. If you can make 50 cents in the heart of Mexico, for example, or make $5 here in America, $5. 15, you're going to come here if you're worth your salt, if you want to put food on the table for your families. And that's what's happening.  And so in order to take pressure off the borders, in order to make the borders more secure, I believe there ought to be a temporary worker card that allows a willing worker and a willing employer to mate up, so long as there's not an American willing to do that job, to join up in order to be able to fulfill the employers' needs.  That has the benefit of making sure our employers aren't breaking the law as they try to fill their workforce needs. It makes sure that the people coming across the border are humanely treated, that they're not kept in the shadows of our society, that they're able to go back and forth to see their families. See, the card, it'll have a period of time attached to it.  It also means it takes pressure off the border. If somebody is coming here to work with a card, it means they're not going to have to sneak across the border. It means our border patrol will be more likely to be able to focus on doing their job.  Now, it's very important for our citizens to also know that I don't believe we ought to have amnesty. I don't think we ought to reward illegal behavior. There are plenty of people standing in line to become a citizen. And we ought not to crowd these people ahead of them in line.  If they want to become a citizen, they can stand in line, too.  And here is where my opponent and I differ. In September 2003, he supported amnesty for illegal aliens.  SCHIEFFER: Time's up. Senator?  KERRY: Let me just answer one part of the last question quickly, and then I'll come to immigration. The American middle-class family isn't making it right now, Bob. And what the president said about the tax cuts has been wiped out by the increase in health care, the increase in gasoline, the increase in tuitions, the increase in prescription drugs.  The fact is, the take-home pay of a typical American family as a share of national income is lower than it's been since 1929. And the take-home pay of the richest . 1 percent of Americans is the highest it's been since 1928.  Under President Bush, the middle class has seen their tax burden go up and the wealthiest's tax burden has gone down. Now that's wrong.  Now, with respect to immigration reform, the president broke his promise on immigration reform. He said he would reform it. Four years later he is now promising another plan.  Here's what I'll do: Number one, the borders are more leaking today than they were before 9/11. The fact is, we haven't done what we need to do to toughen up our borders, and I will.  Secondly, we need a guest-worker program, but if it's all we have, it's not going to solve the problem.  The second thing we need is to crack down on illegal hiring. It's against the law in the United States to hire people illegally, and we ought to be enforcing that law properly.  And thirdly, we need an earned-legalization program for people who have been here for a long time, stayed out of trouble, got a job, paid their taxes, and their kids are American. We got to start moving them toward full citizenship, out of the shadows. SCHIEFFER: Do you want to respond, Mr. President?  BUSH: Well, to say that the borders are not as protected as they were prior to September the 11th shows he doesn't know the borders. They're much better protected today than they were when I was the governor of Texas. We have much more manpower and much more equipment there.  He just doesn't understand how the borders work, evidently, to say that. That is an outrageous claim.  And we'll continue to protect our borders. We're continuing to increase manpower and equipment.  SCHIEFFER: Senator? KERRY: Four thousand people a day are coming across the border. The fact is that we now have people from the Middle East, allegedly, coming across the border.  And we're not doing what we ought to do in terms of the technology. We have iris-identification technology. We have thumbprint, fingerprint technology today. We can know who the people are, that they're really the people they say they are when they cross the border.  We could speed it up. There are huge delays.  The fact is our borders are not as secure as they ought to be, and I'll make them secure.  SCHIEFFER: Next question to you, Senator Kerry. The gap between rich and poor is growing wider. More people are dropping into poverty. Yet the minimum wage has been stuck at, what, $5. 15 an hour now for about seven years. Is it time to raise it?  KERRY: Well, I'm glad you raised that question. It's long overdue time to raise the minimum wage.  And, America, this is one of those issues that separates the president and myself.  We have fought to try to raise the minimum wage in the last years. But the Republican leadership of the House and Senate won't even let us have a vote on it. We're not allowed to vote on it. They don't want to raise the minimum wage. The minimum wage is the lowest minimum wage value it has been in our nation in 50 years.  If we raise the minimum wage, which I will do over several years to $7 an hour, 9. 2 million women who are trying to raise their families would earn another $3,800 a year.  The president has denied 9. 2 million women $3,800 a year, but he doesn't hesitate to fight for $136,000 to a millionaire.  One percent of America got $89 billion last year in a tax cut, but people working hard, playing by the rules, trying to take care of their kids, family values, that we're supposed to value so much in America -- I'm tired of politicians who talk about family values and don't value families.  What we need to do is raise the minimum wage. We also need to hold on to equal pay. Women work for 76 cents on the dollar for the same work that men do. That's not right in America.  And we had an initiative that we were working on to raise women's pay. They've cut it off. They've stopped it. They don't enforce these kinds of things.  Now, I think that it's a matter of fundamental right that if we raise the minimum wage, 15 million Americans would be positively affected. We'd put money into the hands of people who work hard, who obey the rules, who play for the American dream.  And if we did that, we'd have more consumption ability in America, which is what we need right now in order to kick our economy into gear. I will fight tooth and nail to pass the minimum wage.  BUSH: Actually, Mitch McConnell had a minimum-wage plan that I supported that would have increased the minimum wage. But let me talk about what's really important for the worker you're referring to. And that's to make sure the education system works. It's to make sure we raise standards.  Listen, the No Child Left Behind Act is really a jobs act when you think about it. The No Child Left Behind Act says, ""We'll raise standards. We'll increase federal spending. But in return for extra spending, we now want people to measure -- states and local jurisdictions to measure to show us whether or not a child can read or write or add and subtract. ""  You cannot solve a problem unless you diagnose the problem. And we weren't diagnosing problems. And therefore just kids were being shuffled through the school.  And guess who would get shuffled through? Children whose parents wouldn't speak English as a first language just move through.  Many inner-city kids just move through. We've stopped that practice now by measuring early. And when we find a problem, we spend extra money to correct it.  I remember a lady in Houston, Texas, told me, ""Reading is the new civil right,"" and she's right. In order to make sure people have jobs for the 21st century, we've got to get it right in the education system, and we're beginning to close a minority achievement gap now.  You see, we'll never be able to compete in the 21st century unless we have an education system that doesn't quit on children, an education system that raises standards, an education that makes sure there's excellence in every classroom.  SCHIEFFER: Mr. President, I want to go back to something Senator Kerry said earlier tonight and ask a follow-up of my own. He said -- and this will be a new question to you -- he said that you had never said whether you would like to overturn Roe v. Wade. So I'd ask you directly, would you like to? BUSH: What he's asking me is, will I have a litmus test for my judges? And the answer is, no, I will not have a litmus test. I will pick judges who will interpret the Constitution, but I'll have no litmus test. SCHIEFFER: Senator Kerry, you'd like to respond? KERRY: Is that a new question or a 30-second question? SCHIEFFER: That's a new question for Senator -- for President Bush. KERRY: Which time limit. . . SCHIEFFER: You have 90 seconds. KERRY: Thank you very much. Well, again, the president didn't answer the question.  I'll answer it straight to America. I'm not going to appoint a judge to the Court who's going to undo a constitutional right, whether it's the First Amendment, or the Fifth Amendment, or some other right that's given under our courts today -- under the Constitution. And I believe that the right of choice is a constitutional right.  So I don't intend to see it undone.  Clearly, the president wants to leave in ambivalence or intends to undo it.  But let me go a step further. We have a long distance yet to travel in terms of fairness in America. I don't know how you can govern in this country when you look at New York City and you see that 50 percent of the black males there are unemployed, when you see 40 percent of Hispanic children -- of black children in some cities -- dropping out of high school.  And yet the president who talks about No Child Left Behind refused to fully fund -- by $28 billion -- that particular program so you can make a difference in the lives of those young people.  Now right here in Arizona, that difference would have been $131 million to the state of Arizona to help its kids be able to have better education and to lift the property tax burden from its citizens. The president reneged on his promise to fund No Child Left Behind.  He'll tell you he's raised the money, and he has. But he didn't put in what he promised, and that makes a difference in the lives of our children.  SCHIEFFER: Yes, sir? BUSH: Two things. One, he clearly has a litmus test for his judges, which I disagree with. And secondly, only a liberal senator from Massachusetts would say that a 49 percent increase in funding for education was not enough.  We've increased funds. But more importantly, we've reformed the system to make sure that we solve problems early, before they're too late.  He talked about the unemployed. Absolutely we've got to make sure they get educated.  He talked about children whose parents don't speak English as a first language? Absolutely we've got to make sure they get educated.  And that's what the No Child Left Behind Act does.  SCHIEFFER: Senator? KERRY: You don't measure it by a percentage increase. Mr. President, you measure it by whether you're getting the job done. Five hundred thousand kids lost after-school programs because of your budget.  Now, that's not in my gut. That's not in my value system, and certainly not so that the wealthiest people in America can walk away with another tax cut.  $89 billion last year to the top 1 percent of Americans, but kids lost their after-school programs. You be the judge.  SCHIEFFER: All right, let's go to another question. And it is to Senator Kerry. You have two minutes, sir.  Senator, the last debate, President Bush said he did not favor a draft. You agreed with him. But our National Guard and Reserve forces are being severely strained because many of them are being held beyond their enlistments. Some of them say that it's a back-door draft.  Is there any relief that could be offered to these brave Americans and their families?  If you became president, Senator Kerry, what would you do about this situation of holding National Guard and Reservists for these extended periods of time and these repeated call-ups that they're now facing?  KERRY: Well, I think the fact that they're facing these repeated call-ups, some of them two and three deployments, and there's a stop- loss policy that prevents people from being able to get out when their time was up, is a reflection of the bad judgment this president exercised in how he has engaged in the world and deployed our forces. Our military is overextended. Nine out of 10 active-duty Army divisions are either in Iraq, going to Iraq or have come back from Iraq. One way or the other, they're wrapped up in it.  Now, I've proposed adding two active-duty divisions to the armed forces of the United States -- one combat, one support.  In addition, I'm going to double the number of Special Forces so that we can fight a more effective war on terror, with less pressure on the National Guard and Reserve. And what I would like to do is see the National Guard and Reserve be deployed differently here in our own country. There's much we can do with them with respect to homeland security. We ought to be doing that. And that would relieve an enormous amount of pressure.  But the most important thing to relieve the pressure on all of the armed forces is frankly to run a foreign policy that recognizes that America is strongest when we are working with real alliances, when we are sharing the burdens of the world by working through our statesmanship at the highest levels and our diplomacy to bring other nations to our side.  I've said it before, I say it again: I believe the president broke faith with the American people in the way that he took this nation to war. He said he would work through a real alliance. He said in Cincinnati we would plan carefully, we would take every precaution. Well, we didn't. And the result is our forces today are overextended.  The fact is that he did not choose to go to war as a last result. And America now is paying, already $120 billion, up to $200 billion before we're finished and much more probably. And that is the result of this president taking his eye off of Osama bin Laden.  SCHIEFFER: Mr. President? BUSH: The best way to take the pressure off our troops is to succeed in Iraq, is to train Iraqis so they can do the hard work of democracy, is to give them a chance to defend their country, which is precisely what we're doing. We'll have 125,000 troops trained by the end of this year. I remember going on an airplane in Bangor, Maine, to say thanks to the reservists and Guard that were headed overseas from Tennessee and North Carolina, Georgia. Some of them had been there before.  The people I talked to their spirits were high. They didn't view their service as a back-door draft. They viewed their service as an opportunity to serve their country.  My opponent, the senator, talks about foreign policy.  In our first debate he proposed America pass a global test. In order to defend ourselves, we'd have to get international approval. That's one of the major differences we have about defending our country.  I'll work with allies. I'll work with friends. We'll continue to build strong coalitions. But I will never turn over our national- security decisions to leaders of other countries.  We'll be resolute, we'll be strong, and we'll wage a comprehensive war against the terrorists.  SCHIEFFER: Senator? KERRY: I have never suggested a test where we turn over our security to any nation. In fact, I've said the opposite: I will never turn the security of the United States over to any nation. No nation will ever have a veto over us. But I think it makes sense, I think most Americans in their guts know, that we ought to pass a sort of truth standard. That's how you gain legitimacy with your own countrypeople, and that's how you gain legitimacy in the world.  But I'll never fail to protect the United States of America.  BUSH: In 1990, there was a vast coalition put together to run Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait. The international community, the international world said this is the right thing to do, but when it came time to authorize the use of force on the Senate f","elec-deb-60-to-16"
"33_2008","LEHRER: Good evening from the Ford Center for the Performing Arts at the University of Mississippi in Oxford. I'm Jim Lehrer of the NewsHour on PBS, and I welcome you to the first of the 2008 presidential debates between the Republican nominee, Senator John McCain of Arizona, and the Democratic nominee, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois. The Commission on Presidential Debates is the sponsor of this event and the three other presidential and vice presidential debates coming in October.  Tonight's will primarily be about foreign policy and national security, which, by definition, includes the global financial crisis. It will be divided roughly into nine-minute segments.  Direct exchanges between the candidates and moderator follow-ups are permitted after each candidate has two minutes to answer the lead question in an order determined by a coin toss.  The specific subjects and questions were chosen by me. They have not been shared or cleared with anyone.  The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent, no cheers, no applause, no noise of any kind, except right now, as we welcome Senators Obama and McCain.  (APPLAUSE)  Let me begin with something General Eisenhower said in his 1952 presidential campaign. Quote, ""We must achieve both security and solvency. In fact, the foundation of military strength is economic strength,"" end quote.  With that in mind, the first lead question.  Gentlemen, at this very moment tonight, where do you stand on the financial recovery plan?  First response to you, Senator Obama. You have two minutes.  OBAMA: Well, thank you very much, Jim, and thanks to the commission and the University of Mississippi, Ole Miss, for hosting us tonight. I can't think of a more important time for us to talk about the future of the country. You know, we are at a defining moment in our history. Our nation is involved in two wars, and we are going through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.  And although we've heard a lot about Wall Street, those of you on Main Street I think have been struggling for a while, and you recognize that this could have an impact on all sectors of the economy.  And you're wondering, how's it going to affect me? How's it going to affect my job? How's it going to affect my house? How's it going to affect my retirement savings or my ability to send my children to college?  So we have to move swiftly, and we have to move wisely. And I've put forward a series of proposals that make sure that we protect taxpayers as we engage in this important rescue effort.  Number one, we've got to make sure that we've got oversight over this whole process; $700 billion, potentially, is a lot of money.  Number two, we've got to make sure that taxpayers, when they are putting their money at risk, have the possibility of getting that money back and gains, if the market -- and when the market returns.  Number three, we've got to make sure that none of that money is going to pad CEO bank accounts or to promote golden parachutes.  And, number four, we've got to make sure that we're helping homeowners, because the root problem here has to do with the foreclosures that are taking place all across the country.  Now, we also have to recognize that this is a final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush, supported by Senator McCain, a theory that basically says that we can shred regulations and consumer protections and give more and more to the most, and somehow prosperity will trickle down.  It hasn't worked. And I think that the fundamentals of the economy have to be measured by whether or not the middle class is getting a fair shake. That's why I'm running for president, and that's what I hope we're going to be talking about tonight.  LEHRER: Senator McCain, two minutes. MCCAIN: Well, thank you, Jim. And thanks to everybody. And I do have a sad note tonight. Senator Kennedy is in the hospital. He's a dear and beloved friend to all of us. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the lion of the Senate.  I also want to thank the University of Mississippi for hosting us tonight.  And, Jim, I -- I've been not feeling too great about a lot of things lately. So have a lot of Americans who are facing challenges. But I'm feeling a little better tonight, and I'll tell you why.  Because as we're here tonight in this debate, we are seeing, for the first time in a long time, Republicans and Democrats together, sitting down, trying to work out a solution to this fiscal crisis that we're in.  And have no doubt about the magnitude of this crisis. And we're not talking about failure of institutions on Wall Street. We're talking about failures on Main Street, and people who will lose their jobs, and their credits, and their homes, if we don't fix the greatest fiscal crisis, probably in -- certainly in our time, and I've been around a little while.  But the point is -- the point is, we have finally seen Republicans and Democrats sitting down and negotiating together and coming up with a package.  This package has transparency in it. It has to have accountability and oversight. It has to have options for loans to failing businesses, rather than the government taking over those loans. We have to -- it has to have a package with a number of other essential elements to it.  And, yes, I went back to Washington, and I met with my Republicans in the House of Representatives. And they weren't part of the negotiations, and I understand that. And it was the House Republicans that decided that they would be part of the solution to this problem.  But I want to emphasize one point to all Americans tonight. This isn't the beginning of the end of this crisis. This is the end of the beginning, if we come out with a package that will keep these institutions stable.  And we've got a lot of work to do. And we've got to create jobs. And one of the areas, of course, is to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil.  LEHRER: All right, let's go back to my question. How do you all stand on the recovery plan? And talk to each other about it. We've got five minutes. We can negotiate a deal right here. But, I mean, are you -- do you favor this plan, Senator Obama, and you, Senator McCain? Do you -- are you in favor of this plan?  OBAMA: We haven't seen the language yet. And I do think that there's constructive work being done out there. So, for the viewers who are watching, I am optimistic about the capacity of us to come together with a plan. The question, I think, that we have to ask ourselves is, how did we get into this situation in the first place?  Two years ago, I warned that, because of the subprime lending mess, because of the lax regulation, that we were potentially going to have a problem and tried to stop some of the abuses in mortgages that were taking place at the time.  Last year, I wrote to the secretary of the Treasury to make sure that he understood the magnitude of this problem and to call on him to bring all the stakeholders together to try to deal with it.  So -- so the question, I think, that we've got to ask ourselves is, yes, we've got to solve this problem short term. And we are going to have to intervene; there's no doubt about that.  But we're also going to have to look at, how is it that we shredded so many regulations? We did not set up a 21st-century regulatory framework to deal with these problems. And that in part has to do with an economic philosophy that says that regulation is always bad.  LEHRER: Are you going to vote for the plan, Senator McCain? MCCAIN: I -- I hope so. And I... LEHRER: As a United States senator... MCCAIN: Sure. LEHRER: ... you're going to vote for the plan? MCCAIN: Sure. But -- but let me -- let me point out, I also warned about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and warned about corporate greed and excess, and CEO pay, and all that. A lot of us saw this train wreck coming. But there's also the issue of responsibility. You've mentioned President Dwight David Eisenhower. President Eisenhower, on the night before the Normandy invasion, went into his room, and he wrote out two letters.  One of them was a letter congratulating the great members of the military and allies that had conducted and succeeded in the greatest invasion in history, still to this day, and forever.  And he wrote out another letter, and that was a letter of resignation from the United States Army for the failure of the landings at Normandy.  Somehow we've lost that accountability. I've been heavily criticized because I called for the resignation of the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. We've got to start also holding people accountable, and we've got to reward people who succeed.  But somehow in Washington today -- and I'm afraid on Wall Street -- greed is rewarded, excess is rewarded, and corruption -- or certainly failure to carry out our responsibility is rewarded.  As president of the United States, people are going to be held accountable in my administration. And I promise you that that will happen.  LEHRER: Do you have something directly to say, Senator Obama, to Senator McCain about what he just said? OBAMA: Well, I think Senator McCain's absolutely right that we need more responsibility, but we need it not just when there's a crisis. I mean, we've had years in which the reigning economic ideology has been what's good for Wall Street, but not what's good for Main Street. And there are folks out there who've been struggling before this crisis took place. And that's why it's so important, as we solve this short-term problem, that we look at some of the underlying issues that have led to wages and incomes for ordinary Americans to go down, the -- a health care system that is broken, energy policies that are not working, because, you know, 10 days ago, John said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound.  LEHRER: Say it directly to him. OBAMA: I do not think that they are. LEHRER: Say it directly to him. OBAMA: Well, the -- John, 10 days ago, you said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound. And... MCCAIN: Are you afraid I couldn't hear him? (LAUGHTER)  LEHRER: I'm just determined to get you all to talk to each other. I'm going to try. OBAMA: The -- and I just fundamentally disagree. And unless we are holding ourselves accountable day in, day out, not just when there's a crisis for folks who have power and influence and can hire lobbyists, but for the nurse, the teacher, the police officer, who, frankly, at the end of each month, they've got a little financial crisis going on. They're having to take out extra debt just to make their mortgage payments. We haven't been paying attention to them. And if you look at our tax policies, it's a classic example.  LEHRER: So, Senator McCain, do you agree with what Senator Obama just said? And, if you don't, tell him what you disagree with. MCCAIN: No, I -- look, we've got to fix the system. We've got fundamental problems in the system. And Main Street is paying a penalty for the excesses and greed in Washington, D.C., and in the Wall Street. So there's no doubt that we have a long way to go. And, obviously, stricter interpretation and consolidation of the various regulatory agencies that weren't doing their job, that has brought on this crisis.  But I have a fundamental belief in the goodness and strength of the American worker. And the American worker is the most productive, the most innovative. America is still the greatest producer, exporter and importer.  But we've got to get through these times, but I have a fundamental belief in the United States of America. And I still believe, under the right leadership, our best days are ahead of us.  LEHRER: All right, let's go to the next lead question, which is essentially following up on this same subject. And you get two minutes to begin with, Senator McCain. And using your word ""fundamental,"" are there fundamental differences between your approach and Senator Obama's approach to what you would do as president to lead this country out of the financial crisis?  MCCAIN: Well, the first thing we have to do is get spending under control in Washington. It's completely out of control. It's gone -- we have now presided over the largest increase in the size of government since the Great Society. We Republicans came to power to change government, and government changed us. And the -- the worst symptom on this disease is what my friend, Tom Coburn, calls earmarking as a gateway drug, because it's a gateway. It's a gateway to out-of-control spending and corruption.  And we have former members of Congress now residing in federal prison because of the evils of this earmarking and pork-barrel spending.  You know, we spent $3 million to study the DNA of bears in Montana. I don't know if that was a criminal issue or a paternal issue, but the fact is that it was $3 million of our taxpayers' money. And it has got to be brought under control.  As president of the United States, I want to assure you, I've got a pen. This one's kind of old. I've got a pen, and I'm going to veto every single spending bill that comes across my desk. I will make them famous. You will know their names.  Now, Senator Obama, you wanted to know one of the differences. He has asked for $932 million of earmark pork-barrel spending, nearly a million dollars for every day that he's been in the United States Senate.  I suggest that people go up on the Web site of Citizens Against Government Waste, and they'll look at those projects.  That kind of thing is not the way to rein in runaway spending in Washington, D.C. That's one of the fundamental differences that Senator Obama and I have.  LEHRER: Senator Obama, two minutes. OBAMA: Well, Senator McCain is absolutely right that the earmarks process has been abused, which is why I suspended any requests for my home state, whether it was for senior centers or what have you, until we cleaned it up. And he's also right that oftentimes lobbyists and special interests are the ones that are introducing these kinds of requests, although that wasn't the case with me.  But let's be clear: Earmarks account for $18 billion in last year's budget. Senator McCain is proposing -- and this is a fundamental difference between us -- $300 billion in tax cuts to some of the wealthiest corporations and individuals in the country, $300 billion.  Now, $18 billion is important; $300 billion is really important. And in his tax plan, you would have CEOs of Fortune 500 companies getting an average of $700,000 in reduced taxes, while leaving 100 million Americans out.  So my attitude is, we've got to grow the economy from the bottom up. What I've called for is a tax cut for 95 percent of working families, 95 percent.  And that means that the ordinary American out there who's collecting a paycheck every day, they've got a little extra money to be able to buy a computer for their kid, to fill up on this gas that is killing them.  And over time, that, I think, is going to be a better recipe for economic growth than the -- the policies of President Bush that John McCain wants to -- wants to follow.  LEHRER: Senator McCain? MCCAIN: Well, again, I don't mean to go back and forth, but he... (CROSSTALK)  LEHRER: No, that's fine. MCCAIN: Senator Obama suspended those requests for pork-barrel projects after he was running for president of the United States. He didn't happen to see that light during the first three years as a member of the United States Senate, $932 million in requests. Maybe to Senator Obama it's not a lot of money. But the point is that -- you see, I hear this all the time. ""It's only $18 billion."" Do you know that it's tripled in the last five years? Do you know that it's gone completely out of control to the point where it corrupts people? It corrupts people.  That's why we have, as I said, people under federal indictment and charges. It's a system that's got to be cleaned up.  I have fought against it my career. I have fought against it. I was called the sheriff, by the -- one of the senior members of the Appropriations Committee. I didn't win Miss Congeniality in the United States Senate.  Now, Senator Obama didn't mention that, along with his tax cuts, he is also proposing some $800 billion in new spending on new programs.  Now, that's a fundamental difference between myself and Senator Obama. I want to cut spending. I want to keep taxes low. The worst thing we could do in this economic climate is to raise people's taxes.  OBAMA: I -- I don't know where John is getting his figures. Let's just be clear. What I do is I close corporate loopholes, stop providing tax cuts to corporations that are shipping jobs overseas so that we're giving tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the United States. I make sure that we have a health care system that allows for everyone to have basic coverage.  I think those are pretty important priorities. And I pay for every dime of it.  But let's go back to the original point. John, nobody is denying that $18 billion is important. And, absolutely, we need earmark reform. And when I'm president, I will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely.  But the fact is that eliminating earmarks alone is not a recipe for how we're going to get the middle class back on track.  OBAMA: And when you look at your tax policies that are directed primarily at those who are doing well, and you are neglecting people who are really struggling right now, I think that is a continuation of the last eight years, and we can't afford another four. LEHRER: Respond directly to him about that, to Senator Obama about that, about the -- he's made it twice now, about your tax -- your policies about tax cuts. MCCAIN: Well -- well, let me give you an example of what Senator Obama finds objectionable, the business tax. Right now, in the United States of America, business pays the second-highest business taxes in the world, 35 percent. Ireland pays 11 percent.  Now, if you're a business person, and you can locate any place in the world, then, obviously, if you go to the country where it's 11 percent tax versus 35 percent, you're going to be able to create jobs, increase your business, make more investment, et cetera.  I want to cut that business tax. I want to cut it so that businesses will remain in -- in the United States of America and create jobs.  But, again, I want to return. It's a lot more than $18 billion in pork-barrel spending. I can tell you, it's rife. It's throughout.  The United States Senate will take up a continuing resolution tomorrow or the next day, sometime next week, with 2,000 -- 2,000 -- look at them, my friends. Look at them. You'll be appalled.  And Senator Obama is a recent convert, after requesting $932 million worth of pork-barrel spending projects.  So the point is, I want people to have tax cuts. I want every family to have a $5,000 refundable tax credit so they can go out and purchase their own health care. I want to double the dividend from $3,500 to $7,000 for every dependent child in America.  I know that the worst thing we could possibly do is to raise taxes on anybody, and a lot of people might be interested in Senator Obama's definition of ""rich.""  LEHRER: Senator Obama, you have a question for Senator McCain on that? OBAMA: Well, let me just make a couple of points. LEHRER: All right. OBAMA: My definition -- here's what I can tell the American people: 95 percent of you will get a tax cut. And if you make less than $250,000, less than a quarter-million dollars a year, then you will not see one dime's worth of tax increase. Now, John mentioned the fact that business taxes on paper are high in this country, and he's absolutely right. Here's the problem: There are so many loopholes that have been written into the tax code, oftentimes with support of Senator McCain, that we actually see our businesses pay effectively one of the lowest tax rates in the world.  And what that means, then, is that there are people out there who are working every day, who are not getting a tax cut, and you want to give them more.  It's not like you want to close the loopholes. You just want to add an additional tax cut over the loopholes. And that's a problem.  Just one last point I want to make, since Senator McCain talked about providing a $5,000 health credit. Now, what he doesn't tell you is that he intends to, for the first time in history, tax health benefits.  So you may end up getting a $5,000 tax credit. Here's the only problem: Your employer now has to pay taxes on the health care that you're getting from your employer. And if you end up losing your health care from your employer, you've got to go out on the open market and try to buy it.  It is not a good deal for the American people. But it's an example of this notion that the market can always solve everything and that the less regulation we have, the better off we're going to be.  MCCAIN: Well, you know, let me just... LEHRER: We've got to go to another lead question. MCCAIN: I know we have to, but this is a classic example of walking the walk and talking the talk. We had an energy bill before the United States Senate. It was festooned with Christmas tree ornaments. It had all kinds of breaks for the oil companies, I mean, billions of dollars worth. I voted against it; Senator Obama voted for it.  OBAMA: John, you want to give oil companies another $4 billion. MCCAIN: You've got to look at our record. You've got to look at our records. That's the important thing. Who fought against wasteful and earmark spending? Who has been the person who has tried to keep spending under control?  Who's the person who has believed that the best thing for America is -- is to have a tax system that is fundamentally fair? And I've fought to simplify it, and I have proposals to simplify it.  Let's give every American a choice: two tax brackets, generous dividends, and, two -- and let Americans choose whether they want the -- the existing tax code or they want a new tax code.  And so, again, look at the record, particularly the energy bill. But, again, Senator Obama has shifted on a number of occasions. He has voted in the United States Senate to increase taxes on people who make as low as $42,000 a year.  OBAMA: That's not true, John. That's not true. MCCAIN: And that's just a fact. Again, you can look it up. OBAMA: Look, it's just not true. And if we want to talk about oil company profits, under your tax plan, John -- this is undeniable -- oil companies would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks. Now, look, we all would love to lower taxes on everybody. But here's the problem: If we are giving them to oil companies, then that means that there are those who are not going to be getting them. And...  MCCAIN: With all due respect, you already gave them to the oil companies. OBAMA: No, but, John, the fact of the matter is, is that I was opposed to those tax breaks, tried to strip them out. We've got an energy bill on the Senate floor right now that contains some good stuff, some stuff you want, including drilling off-shore, but you're opposed to it because it would strip away those tax breaks that have gone to oil companies. LEHRER: All right. All right, speaking of things that both of you want, another lead question, and it has to do with the rescue -- the financial rescue thing that we started -- started asking about. And what -- and the first answer is to you, Senator Obama. As president, as a result of whatever financial rescue plan comes about and the billion, $700 billion, whatever it is it's going to cost, what are you going to have to give up, in terms of the priorities that you would bring as president of the United States, as a result of having to pay for the financial rescue plan?  OBAMA: Well, there are a range of things that are probably going to have to be delayed. We don't yet know what our tax revenues are going to be. The economy is slowing down, so it's hard to anticipate right now what the budget is going to look like next year. But there's no doubt that we're not going to be able to do everything that I think needs to be done. There are some things that I think have to be done.  We have to have energy independence, so I've put forward a plan to make sure that, in 10 years' time, we have freed ourselves from dependence on Middle Eastern oil by increasing production at home, but most importantly by starting to invest in alternative energy, solar, wind, biodiesel, making sure that we're developing the fuel-efficient cars of the future right here in the United States, in Ohio and Michigan, instead of Japan and South Korea.  We have to fix our health care system, which is putting an enormous burden on families. Just -- a report just came out that the average deductible went up 30 percent on American families.  They are getting crushed, and many of them are going bankrupt as a consequence of health care. I'm meeting folks all over the country. We have to do that now, because it will actually make our businesses and our families better off.  The third thing we have to do is we've got to make sure that we're competing in education. We've got to invest in science and technology. China had a space launch and a space walk. We've got to make sure that our children are keeping pace in math and in science.  And one of the things I think we have to do is make sure that college is affordable for every young person in America.  And I also think that we're going to have to rebuild our infrastructure, which is falling behind, our roads, our bridges, but also broadband lines that reach into rural communities.  Also, making sure that we have a new electricity grid to get the alternative energy to population centers that are using them.  So there are some -- some things that we've got to do structurally to make sure that we can compete in this global economy. We can't shortchange those things. We've got to eliminate programs that don't work, and we've got to make sure that the programs that we do have are more efficient and cost less.  LEHRER: Are you -- what priorities would you adjust, as president, Senator McCain, because of the -- because of the financial bailout cost? MCCAIN: Look, we, no matter what, we've got to cut spending. We have -- as I said, we've let government get completely out of control. Senator Obama has the most liberal voting record in the United States Senate. It's hard to reach across the aisle from that far to the left.  The point -- the point is -- the point is, we need to examine every agency of government.  First of all, by the way, I'd eliminate ethanol subsidies. I oppose ethanol subsidies.  I think that we have to return -- particularly in defense spending, which is the largest part of our appropriations -- we have to do away with cost-plus contracts. We now have defense systems that the costs are completely out of control.  We tried to build a little ship called the Littoral Combat Ship that was supposed to cost $140 million, ended up costing $400 million, and we still haven't done it.  So we need to have fixed-cost contracts. We need very badly to understand that defense spending is very important and vital, particularly in the new challenges we face in the world, but we have to get a lot of the cost overruns under control.  I know how to do that.  MCCAIN: I saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion by fighting a contract that was negotiated between Boeing and DOD that was completely wrong. And we fixed it and we killed it and the people ended up in federal prison so I know how to do this because I've been involved these issues for many, many years. But I think that we have to examine every agency of government and find out those that are doing their job and keep them and find out those that aren't and eliminate them and we'll have to scrub every agency of government. LEHRER: But if I hear the two of you correctly neither one of you is suggesting any major changes in what you want to do as president as a result of the financial bailout? Is that what you're saying? OBAMA: No. As I said before, Jim, there are going to be things that end up having to be ... LEHRER: Like what? OBAMA: ... deferred and delayed. Well, look, I want to make sure that we are investing in energy in order to free ourselves from the dependence on foreign oil. That is a big project. That is a multi-year project. LEHRER: Not willing to give that up? OBAMA: Not willing to give up the need to do it but there may be individual components that we can't do. But John is right we have to make cuts. We right now give $15 billion every year as subsidies to private insurers under the Medicare system. Doesn't work any better through the private insurers. They just skim off $15 billion. That was a give away and part of the reason is because lobbyists are able to shape how Medicare works. They did it on the Medicaid prescription drug bill and we have to change the culture. Tom -- or John mentioned me being wildly liberal. Mostly that's just me opposing George Bush's wrong headed policies since I've been in Congress but I think it is that it is also important to recognize I worked with Tom Coburn, the most conservative, one of the most conservative Republicans who John already mentioned to set up what we call a Google for government saying we'll list every dollar of federal spending to make sure that the taxpayer can take a look and see who, in fact, is promoting some of these spending projects that John's been railing about.  LEHRER: What I'm trying to get at this is this. Excuse me if I may, senator. Trying to get at that you all -- one of you is going to be the president of the United States come January. At the -- in the middle of a huge financial crisis that is yet to be resolved. And what I'm trying to get at is how this is going to affect you not in very specific -- small ways but in major ways and the approach to take as to the presidency. MCCAIN: How about a spending freeze on everything but defense, veteran affairs and entitlement programs. LEHRER: Spending freeze? MCCAIN: I think we ought to seriously consider with the exceptions of caring for our veterans national defense and several other vital issues. LEHRER: Would you go for that? OBAMA: The problem with a spending freeze is you're using a hatchet where you need a scalpel. There are some programs that are very important that are under funded. I went to increase early childhood education and the notion that we should freeze that when there may be, for example, this Medicare subsidy, I think, doesn't make sense. Let me tell you another place to look for some savings. We are currently spending $10 billion a month in Iraq when they have a $79 billion surplus. It seems to me that if we're going to be strong at home as well as strong abroad, that we have to look at bringing that war to a close.  MCCAIN: Look, we are sending $700 billion a year overseas to countries that don't like us very much. Some of that money ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations. We have to have wind, tide, solar, natural gas, flex fuel cars and all that but we also have to have offshore drilling and we also have to have nuclear power. Senator Obama opposes both storing and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. You can't get there from here and the fact is that we can create 700,000 jobs by building constructing 45 new nuclear power plants by the year 2030. Nuclear power is not only important as far as eliminating our dependence on foreign oil but it's also responsibility as far as climate change is concerned. An issue I have been involved in for many, many years and I'm proud of the work of the work that I've done there along with Senator Clinton.  LEHRER: Before we go to another lead question. Let me figure out a way to ask the same question in a slightly different way here. Are you -- are you willing to acknowledge both of you that this financial crisis is going to affect the way you rule the country as president of the United States beyond the kinds of things that you have already -- I mean, is it a major move? Is it going to have a major affect? OBAMA: There's no doubt itâ€™s gonna affect our budgets. There is no doubt about it. Not only -- Even if we get all $700 billion back, let's assume the markets recover, we're holding assets long enough that eventually taxpayers get it back and that happened during the Great Depression when Roosevelt purchased a whole bunch of homes, over time, home values went back up and in fact government made a profit. If we're lucky and we do it right, that could potentially happen but in the short term there's an outlay and we may not see that money for a while. And because of the economy's slowing down, I think we can also expect less tax revenue so there's no doubt that as president I'm going to have to make some tough decision.  The only point I want to make is this, that in order to make those tough decisions we have to know what our values are and who we're fighting for and what our priorities are and if we are spending $300 billion on tax cuts for people who don't need them and weren't even asking for them, and we are leaving out health care which is crushing on people all across the country, then I think we have made a bad decision and I want to make sure we're not shortchanging our long term priorities.  MCCAIN: Well, I want to make sure we're not handing the health care system over to the federal government which is basically what would ultimately happen with Senator Obama's health care plan. I want the families to make decisions between themselves and their doctors. Not the federal government. Look. We have to obviously cut spending. I have fought to cut spending. Senator Obama has $800 billion in new spending programs. I would suggest he start by canceling some of those new spending program that he has. We can't I think adjust spending around to take care of the very much needed programs, including taking care of our veterans but I also want to say again a healthy economy with low taxes would not raising anyone's taxes is probably the best recipe for eventually having our economy recover.  And spending restraint has got to be a vital part of that. And the reason, one of the major reasons why we're in the difficulties we are in today is because spending got out of control. We owe China $500 billion. And spending, I know, can be brought under control because I have fought against excessive spending my entire career. And I got plans to reduce and eliminate unnecessary and wasteful spending and if there's anybody here who thinks there aren't agencies of government where spending can be cut and their budgets slashed they have not spent a lot of time in Washington.  OBAMA: I just want to make this point, Jim. John, it's been your president who you said you agreed with 90 percent of the time who presided over this increase in spending. This orgy of spending and enormous deficits you voted for almost all of his budgets. So to stand here and after eight years and say that you're going to lead on controlling spending and, you know, balancing our tax cuts so that they help middle class families when over the last eight years that hasn't happened I think just is, you know, kind of hard to swallow. LEHRER: Quick response to Senator Obama. MCCAIN: It's well-known that I have not been elected Miss Congeniality in the United States Senate nor with the administration. I have opposed the president on spending, on climate change, on torture of prisoner, on - on Guantanamo Bay. On a -- on the way that the Iraq War was conducted. I have a long record and the American people know me very well and that is independent and a maverick of the Senate and I'm happy to say that I've got a partner that's a good maverick along with me now. LEHRER: All right. Let's go another subject. Lead question, two minutes to you, senator McCain. Much has been said about the lessons of Vietnam. What do you see as the lessons of Iraq? MCCAIN: I think the lessons of Iraq are very clear that you cannot have a failed strategy that will then cause you to nearly lose a conflict. Our initial military success, we went in to Baghdad and everybody celebrated. And then the war was very badly mishandled. I went to Iraq in 2003 and came back and said, we've got to change this strategy. This strategy requires additional troops, it requires a fundamental change in strategy and I fought for it. And finally, we came up with a great general and a strategy that has succeeded. This strategy has succeeded. And we are winning in Iraq. And we will come home with victory and with honor. And that withdrawal is the result of every counterinsurgency that succeeds.  MCCAIN: And I want to tell you that now that we will succeed and our troops will come home, and not in defeat, that we will see a stable ally in the region and a fledgling democracy. The consequences of defeat would have been increased Iranian influence. It would have been increase in sectarian violence. It would have been a wider war, which the United States of America might have had to come back.  So there was a lot at stake there. And thanks to this great general, David Petraeus, and the troops who serve under him, they have succeeded. And we are winning in Iraq, and we will come home. And we will come home as we have when we have won other wars and not in defeat.  LEHRER: Two minutes, how you see the lessons of Iraq, Senator Obama. OBAMA: Well, this is an area where Senator McCain and I have a fundamental difference because I think the first question is whether we should have gone into the war in the first place. Now six years ago, I stood up and opposed this war at a time when it was politically risky to do so because I said that not only did we not know how much it was going to cost, what our exit strategy might be, how it would affect our relationships around the world, and whether our intelligence was sound, but also because we hadn't finished the job in Afghanistan.  We hadn't caught bin Laden. We hadn't put al Qaeda to rest, and as a consequence, I thought that it was going to be a distraction. Now Senator McCain and President Bush had a very different judgment.  And I wish I had been wrong for the sake of the country and they had been right, but that's not the case. We've spent over $600 billion so far, soon to be $1 trillion. We have lost over 4,000 lives. We have seen 30,000 wounded, and most importantly, from a strategic national security perspective, al Qaeda is resurgent, stronger now than at any time since 2001.  We took our eye off the ball. And not to mention that we are still spending $10 billion a month, when they have a $79 billion surplus, at a time when we are in great distress here at home, and we just talked about the fact that our budget is way overstretched and we are borrowing money from overseas to try to finance just some of the basic functions of our government.  So I think the lesson to be drawn is that we should never hesitate to use military force, and I will not, as president, in order to keep the American people safe. But we have to use our military wisely. And we did not use our military wisely in Iraq.  LEHRER: Do you agree with that, the lesson of Iraq? MCCAIN: The next president of the United States is not going to have to address the issue as to whether we went into Iraq or not. The next president of the United States is going to have to decide how we leave, when we leave, and what we leave behind. That's the decision of the next president of the United States. Senator Obama said the surge could not work, said it would increase sectarian violence, said it was doomed to failure. Recently on a television program, he said it exceed our wildest expectations.  But yet, after conceding that, he still says that he would oppose the surge if he had to decide that again today. Incredibly, incredibly Senator Obama didn't go to Iraq for 900 days and never asked for a meeting with General Petraeus.  LEHRER: Well, let's go at some of these things... MCCAIN: Senator Obama is the chairperson of a committee that oversights NATO that's in Afghanistan. To this day, he has never had a hearing. LEHRER: What about that point? MCCAIN: I mean, it's remarkable. LEHRER: All right. What about that point? OBAMA: Which point? He raised a whole bunch of them. LEHRER: I know, OK, let's go to the latter point and we'll back up. The point about your not having been... OBAMA: Look, I'm very proud of my vice presidential selection, Joe Biden, who is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and as he explains, and as John well knows, the issues of Afghanistan, the issues of Iraq, critical issues like that, don't go through my subcommittee because they're done as a committee as a whole. But that's Senate inside baseball. But let's get back to the core issue here. Senator McCain is absolutely right that the violence has been reduced as a consequence of the extraordinary sacrifice of our troops and our military families.  They have done a brilliant job, and General Petraeus has done a brilliant job. But understand, that was a tactic designed to contain the damage of the previous four years of mismanagement of this war.  And so John likes -- John, you like to pretend like the war started in 2007. You talk about the surge. The war started in 2003, and at the time when the war started, you said it was going to be quick and easy. You said we knew where the weapons of mass destruction were. You were wrong.  You said that we were going to be greeted as liberators. You were wrong. You said that there was no history of violence between Shia and Sunni. And you were wrong. And so my question is...  (CROSSTALK)  LEHRER: Senator Obama... OBAMA: ... of judgment, of whether or not -- of whether or not -- if the question is who is best-equipped as the next president to make good decisions about how we use our military, how we make sure that we are prepared and ready for the next conflict, then I think we can take a look at our judgment. LEHRER: I have got a lot on the plate here... MCCAIN: I'm afraid Senator Obama doesn't understand the difference between a tactic and a strategy. But the important -- I'd like to tell you, two Fourths of July ago I was in Baghdad. General Petraeus invited Senator Lindsey Graham and me to attend a ceremony where 688 brave young Americans, whose enlistment had expired, were reenlisting to stay and fight for Iraqi freedom and American freedom. I was honored to be there. I was honored to speak to those troops. And you know, afterwards, we spent a lot of time with them. And you know what they said to us? They said, let us win. They said, let us win. We don't want our kids coming back here.  And this strategy, and this general, they are winning. Senator Obama refuses to acknowledge that we are winning in Iraq.  OBAMA: That's not true. MCCAIN: They just passed an electoral... OBAMA: That's not true. MCCAIN: An election law just in the last few days. There is social, economic progress, and a strategy, a strategy of going into an area, clearing and holding, and the people of the country then become allied with you. They inform on the bad guys. And peace comes to the country, and prosperity. That's what's happening in Iraq, and it wasn't a tactic.  LEHRER: Let me see... OBAMA: Jim, Jim, this is a big... MCCAIN: It was a strategy. And that same strategy will be employed in Afghanistan by this great general. And Senator Obama, who after promising not to vote to cut off funds for the troops, did the incredible thing of voting to cut off the funds for the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. OBAMA: Jim, there are a whole bunch of things we have got to answer. First of all, let's talk about this troop funding issue because John always brings this up. Senator McCain cut -- Senator McCain opposed funding for troops in legislation that had a timetable, because he didn't believe in a timetable. I opposed funding a mission that had no timetable, and was open- ended, giving a blank check to George Bush. We had a difference on the timetable. We didn't have a difference on whether or not we were going to be funding troops.  We had a legitimate difference, and I absolutely understand the difference between tactics and strategy. And the strategic question that the president has to ask is not whether or not we are employing a particular approach in the country once we have made the decision to be there.  The question is, was this wise? We have seen Afghanistan worsen, deteriorate. We need more troops there. We need more resources there. Senator McCain, in the rush to go into Iraq, said, you know what? We've been successful in Afghanistan. There is nobody who can pose a threat to us there.  This is a time when bin Laden was still out, and now they've reconstituted themselves. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates himself acknowledges the war on terrorism started in Afghanistan and it needs to end there.  But we can't do it if we are not willing to give Iraq back its country. Now, what I've said is we should end this war responsibly. We should do it in phases. But in 16 months we should be able to reduce our combat troops, put -- provide some relief to military families and our troops and bolster our efforts in Afghanistan so that we can capture and kill bin Laden and crush al Qaeda.  And right now, the commanders in Afghanistan, as well as Admiral Mullen, have acknowledged that we don't have enough troops to deal with Afghanistan because we still have more troops in Iraq than we did before the surge.  MCCAIN: Admiral Mullen suggests that Senator Obama's plan is dangerous for America. OBAMA: That's not the case. MCCAIN: That's what ... OBAMA: What he said was a precipitous... MCCAIN: That's what Admiral Mullen said. OBAMA: ... withdrawal would be dangerous. He did not say that. That's not true. MCCAIN: And also General Petraeus said the same thing. Osama bin Laden and General Petraeus have one thing in common that I know of, they both said that Iraq is the central battleground. Now General Petraeus has praised the successes, but he said those successes are fragile and if we set a specific date for withdrawal -- and by the way, Senator Obama's original plan, they would have been out last spring before the surge ever had a chance to succeed.  And I'm -- I'm -- understand why Senator Obama was surprised and said that the surge succeeded beyond his wildest expectations.  MCCAIN: It didn't exceed beyond mine, because I know that that's a strategy that has worked and can succeed. But if we snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and adopt Senator Obama's plan, then we will have a wider war and it will make things more complicated throughout the region, including in Afghanistan. LEHRER: Afghanistan, lead -- a new -- a new lead question. Now, having resolved Iraq, we'll move to Afghanistan. (LAUGHTER)  And it goes to you, Senator Obama, and it's a -- it picks up on a point that's already been made. Do you think more troops -- more U.S. troops should be sent to Afghanistan, how many, and when?  OBAMA: Yes, I think we need more troops. I've been saying that for over a year now. And I think that we have to do it as quickly as possible, because it's been acknowledged by the commanders on the ground the situation is getting worse, not better.  We had the highest fatalities among U.S. troops this past year than at any time since 2002. And we are seeing a major offensive taking place -- Al Qaida and Taliban crossing the border and attacking our troops in a brazen fashion. They are feeling emboldened.  And we cannot separate Afghanistan from Iraq, because what our commanders have said is we don't have the troops right now to deal with Afghanistan.  So I would send two to three additional brigades to Afghanistan. Now, keep in mind that we have four times the number of troops in Iraq, where nobody had anything to do with 9/11 before we went in, where, in fact, there was no Al Qaida before we went in, but we have four times more troops there than we do in Afghanistan.  And that is a strategic mistake, because every intelligence agency will acknowledge that Al Qaida is the greatest threat against the United States and that Secretary of Defense Gates acknowledged the central front -- that the place where we have to deal with these folks is going to be in Afghanistan and in Pakistan.  So here's what we have to do comprehensively, though. It's not just more troops.  We have to press the Afghan government to make certain that they are actually working for their people. And I've said this to President Karzai.  Number two, we've got to deal with a growing poppy trade that has exploded over the last several years.  Number three, we've got to deal with Pakistan, because Al Qaida and the Taliban have safe havens in Pakistan, across the border in the northwest regions, and although, you know, under George Bush, with the support of Senator McCain, we've been giving them $10 billion over the last seven years, they have not done what needs to be done to get rid of those safe havens.  And until we do, Americans here at home are not going to be safe.  LEHRER: Afghanistan, Senator McCain? MCCAIN: First of all, I won't repeat the mistake that I regret enormously, and that is, after we were able to help the Afghan freedom fighters and drive the Russians out of Afghanistan, we basically washed our hands of the region. And the result over time was the Taliban, Al Qaida, and a lot of the difficulties we are facing today. So we can't ignore those lessons of history.  Now, on this issue of aiding Pakistan, if you're going to aim a gun at somebody, George Shultz, our great secretary of state, told me once, you'd better be prepared to pull the trigger.  I'm not prepared at this time to cut off aid to Pakistan. So I'm not prepared to threaten it, as Senator Obama apparently wants to do, as he has said that he would announce military strikes into Pakistan.  We've got to get the support of the people of -- of Pakistan. He said that he would launch military strikes into Pakistan.  Now, you don't do that. You don't say that out loud. If you have to do things, you have to do things, and you work with the Pakistani government.  Now, the new president of Pakistan, Kardari (sic), has got his hands full. And this area on the border has not been governed since the days of Alexander the Great.  I've been to Waziristan. I can see how tough that terrain is. It's ruled by a handful of tribes.  And, yes, Senator Obama calls for more troops, but what he doesn't understand, it's got to be a new strategy, the same strategy that he condemned in Iraq. It's going to have to be employed in Afghanistan.  And we're going to have to help the Pakistanis go into these areas and obtain the allegiance of the people. And it's going to be tough. They've intermarried with Al Qaida and the Taliban. And it's going to be tough. But we have to get the cooperation of the people in those areas.  And the Pakistanis are going to have to understand that that bombing in the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad was a signal from the terrorists that they don't want that government to cooperate with us in combating the Taliban and jihadist elements.  So we've got a lot of work to do in Afghanistan. But I'm confident, now that General Petraeus is in the new position of command, that we will employ a strategy which not only means additional troops -- and, by the way, there have been 20,000 additional troops, from 32,000 to 53,000, and there needs to be more.  So it's not just the addition of troops that matters. It's a strategy that will succeed. And Pakistan is a very important element in this. And I know how to work with them. And I guarantee you I would not publicly state that I'm going to attack them.  OBAMA: Nobody talked about attacking Pakistan. Here's what I said. And if John wants to disagree with this, he can let me know, that, if the United States has Al Qaida, bin Laden, top-level lieutenants in our sights, and Pakistan is unable or unwilling to act, then we should take them out.  Now, I think that's the right strategy; I think that's the right policy.  And, John, I -- you're absolutely right that presidents have to be prudent in what they say. But, you know, coming from you, who, you know, in the past has threatened extinction for North Korea and, you know, sung songs about bombing Iran, I don't know, you know, how credible that is. I think this is the right strategy.  Now, Senator McCain is also right that it's difficult. This is not an easy situation. You've got cross-border attacks against U.S. troops.  And we've got a choice. We could allow our troops to just be on the defensive and absorb those blows again and again and again, if Pakistan is unwilling to cooperate, or we have to start making some decisions.  And the problem, John, with the strategy that's been pursued was that, for 10 years, we coddled Musharraf, we alienated the Pakistani population, because we were anti-democratic. We had a 20th-century mindset that basically said, ""Well, you know, he may be a dictator, but he's our dictator.""  And as a consequence, we lost legitimacy in Pakistan. We spent $10 billion. And in the meantime, they weren't going after Al Qaida, and they are more powerful now than at any time since we began the war in Afghanistan.  That's going to change when I'm president of the United States.  MCCAIN: I -- I don't think that Senator Obama understands that there was a failed state in Pakistan when Musharraf came to power. Everybody who was around then, and had been there, and knew about it knew that it was a failed state. But let me tell you, you know, this business about bombing Iran and all that, let me tell you my record.  Back in 1983, when I was a brand-new United States congressman, the one -- the person I admired the most and still admire the most, Ronald Reagan, wanted to send Marines into Lebanon.  And I saw that, and I saw the situation, and I stood up, and I voted against that, because I was afraid that they couldn't make peace in a place where 300 or 400 or several hundred Marines would make a difference. Tragically, I was right: Nearly 300 Marines lost their lives in the bombing of the barracks.  And then we had Somalia -- then we had the first Gulf War. I supported -- I supported that.  I supported us going into Bosnia, when a number of my own party and colleagues was against that operation in Bosnia. That was the right thing to do, to stop genocide and to preserve what was necessary inside of Europe.  I supported what we did in Kosovo. I supported it because ethnic cleansing and genocide was taking place there.  And I have a record -- and Somalia, I opposed that we should turn -- turn the force in Somalia from a peacekeeping force into a peacemaking force, which they were not capable of.  So I have a record. I have a record of being involved in these national security issues, which involve the highest responsibility and the toughest decisions that any president can make, and that is to send our young men and women into harm's way.  And I'll tell you, I had a town hall meeting in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, and a woman stood up and she said, ""Senator McCain, I want you to do me the honor of wearing a bracelet with my son's name on it.""  He was 22 years old and he was killed in combat outside of Baghdad, Matthew Stanley, before Christmas last year. This was last August, a year ago. And I said, ""I will -- I will wear his bracelet with honor.""  And this was August, a year ago. And then she said, ""But, Senator McCain, I want you to do everything -- promise me one thing, that you'll do everything in your power to make sure that my son's death was not in vain.""  That means that that mission succeeds, just like those young people who re-enlisted in Baghdad, just like the mother I met at the airport the other day whose son was killed. And they all say to me that we don't want defeat. I know what thatâ€™s like when an army is defeated.  MCCAIN: A war that I was in, where we had an Army, that it wasn't through any fault of their own, but they were defeated. And I know how hard it is for that -- for an Army and a military to recover from that. And it did and we will win this one and we won't come home in defeat and dishonor and probably have to go back if we fail. OBAMA: Jim, let me just make a point. I've got a bracelet, too, from Sergeant - from the mother of Sergeant Ryan David Jopeck (ph), given to me in green bay. She asked me, can you please make sure another mother is not going through what I'm going through. No U.S. soldier ever dies in vain because they're carrying out the missions of their commander in chief. And we honor all the service that they've provided. Our troops have performed brilliantly. The question is for the next president, are we making good judgments about how to keep America safe precisely because sending our military into battle is such an enormous step.  And the point that I originally made is that we took our eye off Afghanistan, we took our eye off the folks who perpetrated 9/11, they are still sending out videotapes and Senator McCain, nobody is talking about defeat in Iraq, but I have to say we are having enormous problems in Afghanistan because of that decision.  And it is not true you have consistently been concerned about what happened in Afghanistan. At one point, while you were focused on Iraq, you said well, we can ""muddle through"" Afghanistan. You don't muddle through the central front on terror and you don't muddle through going after bin Laden. You don't muddle through stamping out the Taliban.  I think that is something we have to take seriously. And when I'm president, I will.  LEHRER: New ... MCCAIN: You might think that with that kind of concern that Senator Obama would have gone to Afghanistan, particularly given his responsibilities as a subcommittee chairman. By the way, when I'm subcommittee chairman, we take up the issues under my subcommittee. But the important thing is -- the important thing is I visited Afghanistan and I traveled to Waziristan and I traveled to these places and I know what our security requirements are. I know what our needs are. So the point is that we will prevail in Afghanistan, but we need the new strategy and we need it to succeed. But the important thing is, if we suffer defeat in Iraq, which General Petraeus predicts we will, if we adopted Senator Obama's set date for withdrawal, then that will have a calamitous effect in Afghanistan and American national security interests in the region. Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand there is a connected between the two.  LEHRER: I have some good news and bad news for the two of you. You all are even on time, which is remarkable, considering we've been going at it ... OBAMA: A testimony to you, Jim. LEHRER: I don't know about that. But the bad news is all my little five minute things have run over, so, anyhow, we'll adjust as we get there. But the amount of time is even. New lead question. And it goes two minutes to you, Senator McCain, what is your reading on the threat from Iran right now to the security of the United States?  MCCAIN: My reading of the threat from Iran is that if Iran acquires nuclear weapons, it is an existential threat to the State of Israel and it is a threat to other countries in the region because the other countries in the region will feel compelling requirement to acquire nuclear weapons as well. Now we cannot allow a second Holocaust. Let's just make that very clear. What I have proposed for a long time, and I've had conversation with foreign leaders about forming a league of democracies, let's be clear and let's have some straight talk. The Russians are preventing significant action in the United Nations Security Council.  I have proposed a league of democracies, a group of people - a group of countries that share common interests, common values, common ideals, they also control a lot of the world's economic power. We could impose significant meaningful, painful sanctions on the Iranians that I think could have a beneficial effect.  The Iranians have a lousy government, so therefore their economy is lousy, even though they have significant oil revenues. So I am convinced that together, we can, with the French, with the British, with the Germans and other countries, democracies around the world, we can affect Iranian behavior.  But have no doubt, but have no doubt that the Iranians continue on the path to the acquisition of a nuclear weapon as we speak tonight. And it is a threat not only in this region but around the world.  What I'd also like to point out the Iranians are putting the most lethal IEDs into Iraq which are killing young Americans, there are special groups in Iran coming into Iraq and are being trained in Iran. There is the Republican Guard in Iran, which Senator Kyl had an amendment in order to declare them a sponsor of terror. Senator Obama said that would be provocative.  So this is a serious threat. This is a serious threat to security in the world, and I believe we can act and we can act with our friends and allies and reduce that threat as quickly as possible, but have no doubt about the ultimate result of them acquiring nuclear weapons.  LEHRER: Two minutes on Iran, Senator Obama. OBAMA: Well, let me just correct something very quickly. I believe the Republican Guard of Iran is a terrorist organization. I've consistently said so. What Senator McCain refers to is a measure in the Senate that would try to broaden the mandate inside of Iraq. To deal with Iran. And ironically, the single thing that has strengthened Iran over the last several years has been the war in Iraq. Iraq was Iran's mortal enemy. That was cleared away. And what we've seen over the last several years is Iran's influence grow. They have funded Hezbollah, they have funded Hamas, they have gone from zero centrifuges to 4,000 centrifuges to develop a nuclear weapon.  So obviously, our policy over the last eight years has not worked. Senator McCain is absolutely right, we cannot tolerate a nuclear Iran. It would be a game changer. Not only would it threaten Israel, a country that is our stalwart ally, but it would also create an environment in which you could set off an arms race in this Middle East.  Now here's what we need to do. We do need tougher sanctions. I do not agree with Senator McCain that we're going to be able to execute the kind of sanctions we need without some cooperation with countries like Russia and China that are, I think Senator McCain would agree, not democracies, but have extensive trade with Iran but potentially have an interest in making sure Iran doesn't have a nuclear weapon.  But we are also going to have to, I believe, engage in tough direct diplomacy with Iran and this is a major difference I have with Senator McCain, this notion that by not talking to people we are punishing them has not worked. It has not worked in Iran, it has not worked in North Korea. In each instance, our efforts at isolation have actually accelerated their efforts to get nuclear weapons. That will change when I'm president of the United States.  LEHRER: Senator, what about talking? MCCAIN: Senator Obama twice said in debates he would sit down with Ahmadinejad, Chavez and Raul Castro without precondition. Without precondition. Here is Ahmadinenene (ph), Ahmadinejad, who is, Ahmadinejad, who is now in New York, talking about the extermination of the State of Israel, of wiping Israel off the map, and we're going to sit down, without precondition, across the table, to legitimize and give a propaganda platform to a person that is espousing the extermination of the state of Israel, and therefore then giving them more credence in the world arena and therefore saying, they've probably been doing the right thing, because you will sit down across the table from them and that will legitimize their illegal behavior. The point is that throughout history, whether it be Ronald Reagan, who wouldn't sit down with Brezhnev, Andropov or Chernenko until Gorbachev was ready with glasnost and perestroika.  Or whether it be Nixon's trip to China, which was preceded by Henry Kissinger, many times before he went. Look, I'll sit down with anybody, but there's got to be pre-conditions. Those pre-conditions would apply that we wouldn't legitimize with a face to face meeting, a person like Ahmadinejad. Now, Senator Obama said, without preconditions.  OBAMA: So let's talk about this. First of all, Ahmadinejad is not the most powerful person in Iran. So he may not be the right person to talk to. But I reserve the right, as president of the United States to meet with anybody at a time and place of my choosing if I think it's going to keep America safe. And I'm glad that Senator McCain brought up the history, the bipartisan history of us engaging in direct diplomacy.  OBAMA: Senator McCain mentioned Henry Kissinger, who's one of his advisers, who, along with five recent secretaries of state, just said that we should meet with Iran -- guess what -- without precondition. This is one of your own advisers. Now, understand what this means ""without preconditions."" It doesn't mean that you invite them over for tea one day. What it means is that we don't do what we've been doing, which is to say, ""Until you agree to do exactly what we say, we won't have direct contacts with you.""  There's a difference between preconditions and preparation. Of course we've got to do preparations, starting with low","elec-deb-60-to-16"
"15_1988","SHAW: On behalf of the Commission on Presidential Debates, I am pleased to welcome you to the second presidential debate. I am Bernard Shaw of CNN, Cable News Network. My colleagues on the panel are Ann Compton of ABC NEWS; Margaret Warner of Newsweek magazine; and Andrea Mitchell of NBC NEWS. The candidates are Vice President George Bush, the Republican nominee; and Governor Michael Dukakis, the Democratic nominee. (Applause) SHAW: For the next 90 minutes we will be questioning the candidates following a format designed and agreed to by representatives of the two campaigns. However, there are no restrictions on the questions that my colleagues and I can ask this evening, and the candidates have no prior knowledge of our questions. By agreement between the candidates, the first question goes to Gov. Dukakis. You have two minutes to respond. Governor, if Kitty Dukakis were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer? DUKAKIS: No, I don't, Bernard. And I think you know that I've opposed the death penalty during all of my life. I don't see any evidence that it's a deterrent, and I think there are better and more effective ways to deal with violent crime. We've done so in my own state. And it's one of the reasons why we have had the biggest drop in crime of any industrial state in America; why we have the lowest murder rate of any industrial state in America. But we have work to do in this nation. We have work to do to fight a real war, not a phony war, against drugs. And that's something I want to lead, something we haven't had over the course of the past many years, even though the Vice President has been at least allegedly in charge of that war. We have much to do to step up that war, to double the number of drug enforcement agents, to fight both here and abroad, to work with our neighbors in this hemisphere. And I want to call a hemispheric summit just as soon after the 20th of January as possible to fight that war. But we also have to deal with drug education prevention here at home. And that's one of the things that I hope I can lead personally as the President of the United States. We've had great success in my own state. And we've reached out to young people and their families and been able to help them by beginning drug education and prevention in the early elementary grades. So we can fight this war, and we can win this war. And we can do so in a way that marshals our forces, that provides real support for state and local law enforcement officers who have not been getting that support, and do it in a way which will bring down violence in this nation, will help our youngsters to stay away from drugs, will stop this avalanche of drugs that's pouring into the country, and will make it possible for our kids and our families to grow up in safe and secure and decent neighborhoods. SHAW: Mr. Vice President, your one-minute rebuttal. BUSH: Well, a lot of what this campaign is about, it seems to me Bernie, goes to the question of values. And here I do have, on this particular question, a big difference with my opponent. You see, I do believe that some crimes are so heinous, so brutal, so outrageous, and I'd say particularly those that result in the death of a police officer, for those real brutal crimes, I do believe in the death penalty, and I think it is a deterrent, and I believe we need it. And I'm glad that the Congress moved on this drug bill and have finally called for that related to these narcotics drug kingpins. And so we just have an honest difference of opinion: I support it and he doesn't. SHAW: Now to you, Vice President Bush. I quote to you this from Article III of the 20th amendment to the Constitution. Quote: ""If at the time fixed for the beginning of the term of the President the President-elect shall have died, the Vice President elect shall become president,"" meaning, if you are elected and die before inauguration day BUSH: Bernie. SHAW: automatically automatically, Dan Quayle would become the 41st President of the United States. What have you to say about that possibility? BUSH: I'd have confidence in him. And I made a good selection. And I've never seen such a pounding, an unfair pounding, on a young Senator in my entire life. And I've never seen a presidential campaign where the presidential nominee runs against my vice presidential nominee; never seen one before. (Applause) BUSH: But you know, Lloyd Bentsen jumped on Dan Quayle, when Dan Quayle said, he's had roughly the same amount of experience. He had two terms in the Congress. He had two terms in the Senate, serving his second term. He founded authored, the job training partnership act. It says to American working men and women that are thrown out of work for no fault of their own that they're going to have jobs. We're moving into a new competitive age, and we need that kind of thing. He, unlike my opponent, is an expert in national defense; helped amend the INF treaty so we got a good, sound treaty, when these people over here were talking about a freeze. If we'd listened to them, we would never have had a treaty. And so I have great confidence in him. And it's turning around. You know, the American people are fair. They don't like it when there's an unfair pounding and kind of hooting about people. They want to judge it on the record itself. And so I'm proud of my choice. And you know, I don't think age is the only criterion. But I'll tell you something, I'm proud that people who are 30 years old and 40 years old now have someone in their generation that is going to be vice president of the United States of America. I made a good selection. The American people are seeing it, and I'm proud of it; that's what I'd say. And he could do the job. SHAW: Gov. Dukakis, your one-minute rebuttal. DUKAKIS: Bernard, this was the first presidential decision that we as nominees were called upon to make. And that's why people are so concerned. Because it was an opportunity for us to demonstrate what we were looking for in a running mate. More than that, it was the first national security decision that we had to make. The Vice President talks about national security. Three times since World War II, the Vice President has had to suddenly become the President and commander in chief. I picked Lloyd Bentsen, because I thought he was the best qualified person for the job. (Applause) GOY. DUKAKIS: Mr. Bush picked Dan Quayle, and before he did it, he said, watch my choice for vice president, it will tell all And it sure did. It sure did. (Applause) SHAW: Ann Compton for the Vice President. COMPTON: Thank you, Bernie. Mr. Vice President, yes, we read your lips: no new taxes. But despite that same pledge from President Reagan, after income tax rates were cut, in each of the last five years, some Federal taxes have gone up, on Social Security, cigarettes, liquor, even long distance telephone calls. Now that's money straight out of people's wallets. Isn't the phrase, no new taxes, misleading the voters? BUSH: No, because I'm pledged to that, and yes, some taxes have gone up. And the main point is, taxes have been cut, and yet income is up to the Federal Government by 25 percent in the last three years. And so what I want to do is keep this expansion going. I don't want to kill it off by a tax increase. More Americans at work today than at any time in the history of the country, and a greater percentage of the work force. And the way you kill expansions is to raise taxes. And I don't want to do that, and I won't do that. And what I have proposed is something much better. And it's going to take discipline of the executive branch; it's going to take discipline of the congressional branch. And that is what I call a flexible freeze that allows growth about 4 percent or the rate of inflation but does not permit the Congress just to add on spending. I hear this talk about a blank check. The American people are pretty smart: they know who writes out the checks. And they know who appropriates the money. It is the United States Congress. And by two to one, Congress is blamed for these deficits. And the answer is to discipline both the executive branch and the congressional branch by holding the line on taxes. So I'm pledged to do that. And those pessimists who say it can't be done, I'm sorry, I just have a fundamental disagreement with them SHAW: Gov. Dukakis, your one-minute response. DUKAKIS: Ann, the Vice President made that pledge. He's broken it three times in the past year already. So it isn't worth the paper it's printed on. And what I'm concerned about is that if we continue with the policies that Mr. Bush is talking about here this evening, the flexible freeze somebody described it the other day as a kind of economic slurpee he wants to spend billions on virtually every weapons system around. He says he's not going to raise taxes, though he has broken that pledge repeatedly. He says he wants to give the wealthiest one percent of the people in this country a five-year $40 billion tax break, and we're going to pay for it. And he's been proposing all kinds of programs for new spending costing billions. Now if we continue with these policies, this trillion and a half dollars worth of new debt that's already been added on the backs of the American taxpayer is going to increase even more, and if we continue with this for another four years, then I'm worried about the next generation, whether we can ever turn this situation around. No, we need a chief executive who is prepared to lead; who won't blame the Congress; who will lead to bring down that deficit, who will make tough choices on spending SHAW: Governor DUKAKIS: will go out and do the job that we expect of him and do it with the Congress of the United States. (Applause) SHAW: And to Governor Dukakis. COMPTON: Governor, let me follow up on that by asking you you've said it many times that you have balanced ten budgets in a row in Massachusetts. Are you promising the American people here tonight that within a four-year presidential term, you will balance the federal budget? DUKAKIS: No, I'm not sure I can promise that; I don't think either one of us can really. There is no way of anticipating what may happen. I will say this: that we will set as our goal a steady, gradual reduction of the deficit, which will require tough choices on spending; it will require a good strong rate of economic growth; it will require a plan that the president works out with the Congress doesn't blame them, works it out with them, which brings that deficit down; it will require us to go out and collect billions and billions of dollars in taxes owed that aren't being paid in this country. And that's grossly unfair to the average American who is paying his taxes and paying them on time and doesn't have any alternative: it's taken out of his paycheck. Mr. Bush says we are going to put the IRS on every taxpayer. That's not what we are going to do. I'm for the taxpayer bill of rights. But I think it's unconscionable, Ann, that we should be talking or thinking about imposing new taxes on average Americans when there are billions out there, over $100 billion, in taxes owed that aren't being paid. Now, I think if we work together on it, and if you have a president that will work with the Congress and the American people, we can bring that deficit down steadily, $20, $25, $30 billion a year, build economic growth, build a good strong future for America, invest in those things which we must invest in economic development, good jobs, good schools for our kids, college opportunity for young people, decent health care and affordable housing, and a clean and safe environment. We can do all of those things, and at the same time build a future in which we are standing on a good strong fiscal foundation. Senator Bentsen said, as you recall at the debate with Senator Quayle, that if you give any of us $200 billion worth of hot checks a year, we can create an illusion of prosperity. But sooner or later that credit card mentality isn't going to work. And I want to bring to the White House a sense of strength and fiscal responsibility which will build a good strong foundation under which this country, or above which country can move, grow, invest, and build the best America for its people and for our kids and our grandkids. SHAW: Mr. Vice President, your response. BUSH: The Governor has to balance the budget in his state he is required to by law. He has raised taxes several times. I wish he would join me, as a matter of fact, in appealing to the American people for the balanced budget amendment for the federal government and for the line-item veto. (Applause) I'd like to have that line-item veto for the president, because I think that would be extraordinarily helpful. And I won't do one other thing that he's had to do: took $29 million out of his state pension fund that's equivalent at the federal level of taking out of the Social Security trust fund. I'm not going to do that; I won't do that. (Applause) And so I'm still a little unclear as to whether he's for or against the tax increase. I have been for the taxpayer bill of rights all along. And this idea of unleashing a whole bunch-an army, a conventional force army, of IRS agents into everybody's kitchen I mean, he's against most defense matters, and now he wants to get an army of JRS auditors going out there. (Laughter) I'm against that; I oppose that. (Boos and applause) SHAW: I'm going to say this and I'm going to say it once to every person in this auditorium: what these candidates are about is of utmost seriousness to the American voters; they should be heard and you should be quiet. If you are not quiet, I am going to implore the candidates to do something about quieting their own partisans. But we cannot get through this program with these outbursts. Margaret Warner for Governor Dukakis. WARNER: Good evening, Governor, Mr. Vice President. Governor, you won the first debate on intellect, and yet you lost it on heart. BUSH: Just a minute. WARNER: You'll get your turn. DUKAKIS: I don't know if the vice president agrees with that. WARNER: The American public admired your performance, but didn't seem to like you much. Now, Ronald Reagan has found his personal warmth to be a tremendous political asset. Do you think that a president has to be likable to be an effective leader? DUKAKIS: Margaret, may I go back and just say to the vice president that I didn't raid the pension fund of Massachusetts you are dead wrong, George, we didn't do that. As a matter of fact, I'm the first governor in the history of my state to fund that pension system, and I'm very proud of that. (Applause) I have been in politics for twenty-five years, Margaret; I've won a lot of elections, I've lost a few, as you know, and learned from those losses. I won the Democratic nomination in fifty-one separate contests. I think I'm a reasonably likable guy. (Laughter, scattered applause) I'm serious though I think I'm a little more lovable these days than I used to be back in my youth when I began in my state legislature. But I'm also a serious guy. I think the presidency of the United States is a very serious office, and I think we have to address these issues in a very serious way. So I hope and expect that I will be liked by the people of this country as president of the United States; I certainly hope I will be liked by them on the 8th of November. (Laughter) But I also think it's important to be somebody who is willing to make those tough choices. Now, we have just heard two or three times from the vice president: he's not going to raise taxes. I repeat, within days after you made that pledge, you broke it; you said, well, maybe as a last resort we'll do it. And you supported legislation this year that's involved tax increases not once, but twice. So that pledge isn't realistic, and I think the vice president knows it; I think the people of this country know it. The fact of the matter is that the next president of the United States is going to have to go to the White House seriously, he is going to have to work with the Congress seriously he can't turn to the Congress and blame them for the fact that we don't have a balanced budget and that we have billions and billions of dollars in red ink. And I am going to be a president who is serious, I hope and expect will be liked by the American people. But more than that, to do the kind of job that I'm elected to do, will do it with as much good humor as I can, but at the same time will do it in a way which will achieve the goals we want for ourselves and our people. And I think we know what they are: a good strong future, a future in which there is opportunity for all of our citizens. SHAW: One minute from the Vice President. BUSH: I don't think it's a question of whether people like you or not to make you an effective leader. I think it's whether you share the broad dreams of the American people, whether you have confidence in the people's ability to get things done or whether you think it all should be turned over, as many of the liberals do, to Washington, D.C. You see, I think it's a question of values, not likability or loveability, it's a question in foreign affairs in experience, knowing world leaders, knowing how to build on a superb record of this administration in arms control, because you'd know exactly how to begin. You have to learn from experience that making unilateral cuts in defense system is not the way that you enhance peace. You've got to understand that it is only the United States that can stand for freedom and democracy around the world and we can't turn it over to the United Nations or other multilateral organizations. It is, though, trying to understand the heartbeat of the country. And I know these campaigns get knocked a lot, but I think I'd be a better President now for having had to travel to these communities and understand the family values and the importance of neighborhood. (Applause) BUSH: Please. SHAW: Margaret Warner for the Vice President. WARNER: I'd like to follow up on that Mr. Vice President. The tenor of the campaign you've been running, in terms of both the issues and your rhetoric has surprised even some of your friends. Senator Mark Hatfield who's known your family a long time and who knew your father, the late Senator Prescott Bush, said, and I quote, ""If his father were alive today, I'm sure his father would see it as a shocking transformation."" Is Senator Hatfield right? BUSH: What was he referring to? WARNER: He was referring to your performance in the campaign. BUSH: I think my dad would be pretty proud of me, because I think we've come a long long way and I think, you know three months ago, I remember some of the great publications in this country had written me off. And what I've had to do is define, not just my position, but to define his and I hope I've done it fairly. And the reason I've had to do that is that he ran on the left in the Democratic primary, ran firmly and ran with conviction and ran on his record. And then at that Democratic convention, they made a determination and they said there, ideology doesn't matter, just competence. And in the process the negatives began. It wasn't me that was there at that convention. Thank God I was up in the with Jimmy Baker camping out and I didn't have to hear all the personal attacks on me out of that Democratic convention. And I'm not the one that compared the President of the United States rotting from like a dead fish from the head down. I didn't do that. But I have defined the issues and I am not going to let Governor Dukakis go through this election without explaining some of these very liberal position he's the one a liberal, traditional liberal a progressive liberal Democrat. He's the one that brought up, to garner primary votes, the whole question of the ACLU. And I have enormous difference with the ACLU on their politic agenda. Not on their defending some minority opinion on the right or the left. I support that. But what I don't like is this left wing political agenda and therefore I have to help define that and if he's unwilling to do it, if he says ideology doesn't matter, I don't agree with him. (Applause) SHAW: One minute from Governor Dukakis. DUKAKIS: Well, Margaret, we've heard it again tonight and I'm not surprised, the labels. I guess the Vice President two or three times, said I was coming from the left. In 1980, President Reagan called you a liberal for voting for Federal gun control. And this is something Republicans have used for a long time. They tried it with Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman and John Kennedy. It's not labels. It's our vision of America. And we have two fundamentally different visions of America. The Vice President is complacent, thinks we ought to stick with the status quo, doesn't think we ought to move ahead, thinking things are okay as they are. I don't. I think this is a great country, because we've always wanted to do better, to make our country better, to make our lives better. We've always been a nation which was ambitious for America and we move forward. And that's the kind of America I want. That's the kind of leadership I want to provide. But I don't think these labels mean a thing and I would hope that tonight in the course of the rest of this campaign, we can have good solid disagreements on issues. There's nothing the matter with that. But let's stop labeling each other and lets' get to the heart of the matter which is the future of this country. (Applause) SHAW: Andrea Mitchell, for the Vice President. MITCHELL: Mr. Vice President, Governor. Mr. Vice President, let me return for a moment to the issue of the budget, because so much has already been put off limits in your campaign that most people do not believe that the flexible freeze alone will solve the problem of the deficit. So, let's turn to defense for a moment. Pentagon officials tell us that there is not enough money in the budget to handle military readiness, preparedness, as well as new weapons systems that have been proposed, as well as those already in the pipeline. You were asked in the first debate what new weapons systems you would cut. You mentioned three that had already been canceled. Can you tonight share with us three new weapons systems that you could? BUSH: If I knew of three new weapons systems that I thought were purely waste and weren't protected by the Congress, they wouldn't be in the budget. They would not be in the budget, but you want one now? I'll give you one, that HMET, that heavy truck, that's cost what is it $850 million and the Pentagon didn't request it and, yet, a member of Congress, a very powerful one, put it in the budget. I think we can save money through this whole very sophisticated concept, Andrea, that I know you do understand of competitive strategies. It is new and it is very very different than what's happened, but it's not quite ready to be totally implemented. But it's very important. I think we can say, through the Packard Commission Report and I'm very proud that David Packard, the originator of that report, is strongly supporting me. So, it's not a question of saying our budget is full of a lot of waste. I don't believe that. I do think this. We're in the serious stages of negotiation with the Soviet Union on the strategic arms control talks. And we're protecting a couple of options in terms of modernizing our strategic forces. My Secretary of Defense is going to have to make a very difficult decision in which system to go forward with. But we are protecting both of them. We are moving forward with negotiations and, you see, I just think it would be dumb negotiating policy with the Soviets to cut out one or the other of the two options right now. The Soviets are modernizing. They continue to modernize and we can't simply we've got enough nuclear weapons, let's freeze. We can't do that. We have to have modernization, especially if we achieve the 50 percent reduction in strategic weapons that our President is taking the leadership to attain. And, so, that's the way I'd reply to it and I believe we can have the strongest and best defense possible if we modernize, if we go forward with competitive strategies and if we do follow through on the Packard Commission report. SHAW: Governor Dukakis, one minute. DUKAKIS: Well, Andrea, we've just had another example of why the Vice President's mathematics just don't add up. I think you know because you've covered these issues, that there's no way that we can build all of the weapons the Vice President says he wants to build within the defense budget. Everybody knows that including the people at the Pentagon. Now, my defense secretary is going to have a lot to do with those decisions, but it's going to be the President who's going to have to ultimately decide before that budget goes to the Congress what weapons systems are going to go and what are going to stay. We are not going to spend the billions and trillions that Mr. Bush wants to spend on Star Wars. We're not going to spend billions on MX's on railroad cars, which is a weapons system we don't need, can't afford and won't help our defense posture at all. We're not going to spend hundreds of millions on a space plane from Washington to Tokyo. Those are decisions that the chief executive has to make. Yes, we're going to have a strong and credible and effective nuclear deterrent. We're going to go forward with the Stealth and the D-5 and the advance cruise missile and good conventional forces. But the next President of the United States will have to make some tough and difficult decisions. I'm prepared to make them, the Vice President is not. SHAW: Governor, Andrea has a question for you. MITCHELL: Governor, continuing on that subject, then, you say we have to do something about conventional forces. You have supported the submarine launch missile, the D-5 you just referred to. Yet, from Jerry Ford to Jimmy Carter to Ronald Reagan, there has been a bipartisan consensus in favor of modernizing the land based missiles. Now, you have ruled out the MX and the Midgetman. More recently, some of your aides have hinted at some flexibility you might show about some other new form of missile. Can you tell us tonight why you have rejected the wisdom of people as diverse as Sam Nunn, Henry Kissinger, Al Gore, people in both parties and what type of land based missile would you consider? DUKAKIS: Well, Andrea, today we have 13,000 strategic nuclear warheads, on land, on air and in the sea. That's an incredibly powerful nuclear deterrent. I don't rule out modernization, and there are discussions going on now in the Congress, I know with the Pentagon, about a less expensive modernized land-based leg of the triad. But there are limits to what we can spend. There are limits to this nation's ability to finance these weapons systems. And one of the things that the Vice President either ignores or won't address is the fact that you can't divorce our military security from our economic security. How can we build a strong America militarily that's teeter-tottering on a mountain of debt? And if we go forward with the kinds of policies that the Vice President is suggesting tonight and has in the past, that debt is going to grow bigger and bigger and bigger. So military security and economic security go hand in hand. And we will have a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent. We're going to have conventional forces that are well maintained, well equipped, well trained, well supported. And we have serious problems with our conventional forces at the present time, and they'll get worse unless we have a president who is willing to make some of these decisions. And we also have important domestic priorities, in education and housing and health care, in economic development, in job training, in the environment. And all of these things are going to have to be addressed. That's why I say again to all of you out there who have to deal with your household budgets and know how difficult it is that the next President has to do the same. I want the men and women of our Armed Forces to have the support they need to defend us; the support they need when they risk our lives to keep us free and to keep this country free. But we cannot continue to live on a credit card. We cannot continue to tell the American people that we're going to build all of these systems, and at the same time, invest in important things here at home, and be serious about building a strong and good America. And that's the kind of America I want to build. SHAW: One minute for the Vice President. BUSH: I think the foremost (Applause) BUSH: Can we start the clock over? I held off for the applause. SHAW: You can proceed, sir. BUSH: I think the foremost responsibility of a president really gets down to the national security of this country. The Governor talks about limits, what we can't do, opposes these two modernization systems, talks now about well, we'll develop some new kind of a missile. It takes eight years, ten years, to do that. He talked about a nuclear freeze back at the time when I was in Europe trying to convince European public opinion that we ought to go forward with the deployment of the INF weapons. And thank God, the freeze people were not heard. They were wrong. And the result is, we deployed, and the Soviets kept deploying, and then we negotiated from strength. And now we have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age to ban weapons. You just don't make unilateral cuts in the naive hope that the Soviets are going to behave themselves. World peace is important, and we have enhanced the peace. And I'm proud to have been a part of an administration that has done exactly that. Peace through strength works. SHAW: Ann Compton for Gov. Dukakis. COMPTON: Governor, today they may call them role models, but they used to be called heroes, the kind of public figure who could inspire a whole generation, someone who was larger than life. My question is not, who your heroes were. My question instead is, who are the heroes who are there in American life today? Who are the ones who you would point out to young Americans as figures who should inspire this country? DUKAKIS: Well, I think when I think of heroes, I think back, not presently, Ann. But there are many people who I admire in this country today. Some of them are in public life in the Senate, the Congress. Some of my fellow governors who are real heroes to me. I think of those young athletes who represented us at the Olympics were tremendously impressive. We were proud of them. We felt strongly about them, and they did so well by us. I can think of doctors and scientists, Jonas Salk who for example discovered a vaccine which cured one of the most dread diseases we ever had. And he's a hero. I think of classroom teachers, classroom teachers that I have had, classroom teachers that youngsters have today who are real heroes to our young people. Because they inspire them. They teach them. But more than that, they are role models. Members of the clergy who have done the same. Drug counselors out there in the street who are providing help to youngsters who come up to me and others who ask for help and want help, are doing the hard work, the heroic work, which it takes to provide that kind of leadership, that kind of counseling, that kind of support. I think of people in the law enforcement community who are taking their lives in their hands everyday, when they go up to one of those doors and kick it down and try to stop this flow of drugs into our communities and into our kids. So there are many, many heroes in this country today. These are people that give of themselves everyday and every week and every month. In many cases they are people in the community who are examples, and are role models. And I would hope that one of the things I could do as president is to recognize them, to give them the kind of recognition that they need and deserve so that more and more young people can themselves become the heroes of tomorrow, can go into public service, can go into teaching, can go into drug counseling, can go into law enforcement, and be heroes themselves to generations yet to come. SHAW: One minute for Vice President Bush. BUSH: I think of a teacher right here, largely Hispanic school, Jaime Escalante, teaching calculus to young kids, 80 percent of them going on to college. I think of a young man now in this country named Villadaris, who was released from a Cuban jail. Came out and told the truth in this brilliant book, Against All Hope, about what is actually happening in Cuba. I think of those people that took us back into space again, Rick Houk and that crew, as people that are worthy of this. I agree with the Governor on athletics. And there's nothing corny about having sports heroes, young people that are clean and honorable and out there setting the pace. I think of Dr. Fauci. Probably never heard of him. You did, Ann heard of him. He's a very fine research, top doctor, at the National Institute of Health, working hard doing something about research on this disease of AIDS. But look, I also think we ought to give a little credit to the President of the United States. He is the one who has gotten us that first arms control agreement. SHAW: Mr. Vice President BUSH: And the cynics abounded. And he is leaving office with a popularity at an all-time high, because American people SHAW: Mr. Vice President, your time has expired. BUSH: say, he is our hero. (Applause) SHAW: Ann has a question for you, Mr. Vice President. COMPTON: Let's change the pace a little bit, Mr. Vice President. In this campaign some hard and very bitter things have been spoken by each side about each side. If you'd consider for a moment Gov. Dukakis and his years of public service, is there anything nice you can say about him, anything you find admirable? BUSH: You're stealing my close. I had something very nice to say in there. COMPTON: Somebody leak my question to you? BUSH: No, let me tell you something about that. And Barbara and I were sitting there before that Democratic convention. And we saw the Governor and his son on television the night before and his family, and his mother who was there. And I'm saying to Barbara, you know, we've always kept family as a bit of an oasis for us. You all know me, and we've held it back a little. But we used that as a role model, the way he took understandable pride in his heritage, what his family means to him. And we've got a strong family. And we watched that. And we said, hey, we've got to unleash the Bush kids. And so you saw ten grandchildren there jumping all over their grandfather at the convention. You see our five kids, all over this country, and their spouses. And so I would say that the concept of the Dukakis family has my great respect. And I would say, I don't know whether that's kind or not, it's just an objective statement. I think the man anybody that gets into this political arena and has to face you guys everyday deserves a word of praise. Because it's gotten a little ugly out there. It's gotten a little nasty. It's not much fun sometimes. And I would cite again Dan Quayle. I've been in politics a long time, and I don't remember that kind of piling on, that kind of ugly rumor that never was true, printed. Now, come on. So some of it is unfair. But he's in the arena. Teddy Roosevelt used to talk about the arena, you know, daring to fail greatly or succeed, no matter. He's in there. So I salute these things. I salute those who participate in the political process. Sam Raybum had a great expression on this. He said here were all these intellectuals out there griping and complaining and saying it was negative coverage. Rayburn says, yeah, and that guy never ran for sheriff either. Michael Dukakis has run for sheriff, and so has George Bush. SHAW: Governor, a one-minute response. DUKAKIS: I didn't hear the word ""liberal"" or ""left"" one time. I thank you for that. BUSH: That's not bad. That's true. DUKAKIS: And doesn't that prove the point, George, which is that values like family and education and community, decent homes for young people that family on Long Island I visited on Monday where Lou and Betty Tolamo (phonetic) bought a house for some $19,000 back in 1962, have had seven children, they're all making good livings. They can't live in the community which they grew up in. Those are basic American values. I believe in them. I think you believe in them. They're not left or right. They're decent American values. I guess the one thing that concerns me about this, Ann, is this attempt to label things which all of us believe in. We may have different approaches. We may think that you deal with them in different ways. But they're basically American, I believe in them. George Bush believes in them. I think the vast majority of Americans believe in them. And I hope SHAW: Governor. DUKAKIS: the tone we've just heard might just be the tone we have for the rest of the campaign. I think the American people would appreciate that. (Applause) SHAW: Margaret Warner for the vice president. WARNER: Vice President Bush, abortion remains with us as a very troubling issue, and I'd like to explore that for a minute with you. You have said that you regard abortion as murder, yet you would make exceptions in the case of rape and incest. My question is, why should a woman who discovers through amniocentesis that her baby will be born with Tay-Sachs disease, for instance, that the baby will live at most two years, and those two years in incredible pain, be forced to carry the fetus to term, and yet a woman who becomes pregnant through incest would be allowed to abort her fetus? BUSH: Because you left out one other exception, the health of the mother. Let me answer your question and I hope it doesn't get too personal or maudlin. Barb and I lost a child, you know that we lost a daughter, Robin. I was over running records in west Texas, and I got a call from her, come home; went to the doctor; the doctor said, beautiful child, your child has a few weeks to live. And I said, what can we do about it. He said, no, she has leukemia, acute leukemia, a few weeks to live. We took the child to New York. Thanks to the miraculous sacrifice of doctors and nurses, the child stayed alive for six months and then died. If that child were here today, and I was told the same thing, my granddaughter, Noel for example that child could stay alive for ten or fifteen years, or maybe for the rest of her life. And so I don't think that you make an exception based on medical knowledge at the time. I think human life is very, very precious. And, look, this hasn't been an easy decision for me to meet. I know others disagree with it. But when I was in that little church across the river from Washington and saw our grandchild christened in our faith, I was very pleased indeed that the mother had not aborted that child, and put the child up for adoption. And so I just feel this is where I'm coming from. And it is personal. And I don't assail him on that issue, or others on that issue. But that's the way I, George Bush, feel about it. (Scattered applause) SHAW: One minute for Governor Dukakis. DUKAKIS: Margaret, Kitty and I had very much the same kind of experience that the Bushes had: we lost a baby, lived about twenty minutes after it was born. But isn't the real question that we have to answer not how many exceptions we make, because the vice president himself is prepared to make exceptions. It's who makes the decision, who makes this very difficult, very wrenching decision? (Applause) And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision. Who are we to say, well, under certain circumstances, it's all right, but under other circumstances it isn't? That's a decision that only a woman can make, after consulting her conscience and consulting her religious principles. And I would hope that we would give to women in this country the right to make that decision, and to make it in the exercise of their conscience and religious beliefs. (Applause) SHAW: Governor, Margaret has a question for you. WARNER: Governor, I'd like to return to the topic of the defense budget for a minute. You have said in this campaign that you would maintain a stable defense budget, yet you are on the board, on the advisory board DUKAKIS: And, incidentally, may I say that that's the decision of the Congress, and the president has concurred. WARNER: Yet you are on the board of a group called Jobs with Peace, in Boston, that advocates a 25-percent cut in the defense budget and the transfer of that money to the domestic economy. My question is, do you share that goal perhaps as a long-range goal, and, if not, are you aware of or why do you permit this group to continue to use your name on its letterhead for fundraising? DUKAKIS: I think I was on the advisory committee, Margaret. No, I don't happen to share that goal. It's an example of how oftentimes we may be associated with organizations all of whose particular positions we don't support, even though we support in general the hope that over time, particularly if we can get those reductions in strategic weapons, if we can get a comprehensive test ban treaty, if we can negotiate with the Soviet Union and bring down the level of conventional forces in Europe with deeper cuts in the Soviet side, yes, at some point it may be possible to reduce defense outlays and use those for important things here at home, like jobs and job training and college opportunity and health and housing and the environment and the things that all of us care about. But I do think this, that the next president, even within a relatively stable budget and that's what we are going to have for the foreseeable future will have to make those tough choices that I was talking about and that Mr. Bush doesn't seem to want to make. And that really is going to be a challenge for the next president of the United States; I don't think there's any question about it. But I also see a tremendous opportunity now to negotiate with the Soviet Union to build on the progress that we've made with the INF Treaty, which I strongly supported and most Democrats did to get those reductions in strategic weapons, to get a test ban treaty, and to really make progress on the reduction of conventional forces in Europe. And if we can do that and do it in a way that gets deeper cuts on the Soviet side, which is where they ought to come from, then I think we have an opportunity over the long haul to begin to move some of our resources from the military to important domestic priorities that can provide college opportunity for that young woman whose mother wrote me from Texas just the other day, from Longview, Texas: two teachers, a mother and a father who have a child that's a freshman in college, an electrical engineering major, a very bright student and they can't afford to keep that child in college. So I hope that we can begin to move those resources. It's not going to happen overnight; it certainly will have to happen on a step-by-step basis as we make progress in arms negotiation and arms control and arms reduction. But it certainly ought to be the long-term goal of all Americans and I think it is. SHAW: One minute for the vice president. BUSH: The defense budget today takes far less percentage of the gross national product than it did in President Kennedy's time, for example moved tremendously. And you see, I think we're facing a real opportunity for world peace. This is a big question. And it's a question as to whether the United States will continue to lead for peace. See, I don't believe any other country can pick up the mantel. I served at the UN. I don't think we can turn over these kinds of decisions of the collective defense to the United Nations or anything else. So, what I'm saying is, we are going to have to make choices. I said I would have the Secretary of Defense sit down. But while the President is negotiating with the Soviet Union, I simply do not want to make these unilateral cuts. And I think those that advocated the freeze missed the point that there was a better way and that better way has resulted in a principle asymmetrical cuts. The Soviets take out more than we do and the principle of intrusive verification. And those two principles can now be applied to conventional forces, to strategic forces, provided SHAW: Mr. Vice President BUSH: We don't give away our hand before we sit down at the head table. (Applause) SHAW: Andrea Mitchell for Governor Dukakis. MITCHELL: Governor, you've said tonight that you set as a goal the steady reduction of the deficit. And you've talked about making tough choices, so perhaps I can get you to make one of those tough choices. No credible economist in either party accepts as realistic your plan to handle the deficit by tightening tax collection, investing in economic growth, bringing down interest rates, and cutting weapons systems DUKAKIS: And some domestic programs as well, Andrea. MITCHELL: And some domestic programs as well. So, let's assume now, for argument purpose, that it is the spring of 1989 and you are President Dukakis, and you discover that all of those economists were right and you were wrong. You are now facing that dreaded last resort increase taxes. Which tax do you decide is the least onerous? DUKAKIS: May I disagree with the premise of your question? MITCHELL: For the sake of argument, no. (Applause) DUKAKIS: As a matter of reality, Fm going to have to because we have had not one but two detailed studies which indicate that there are billions and billions of dollars to be collected that are not being paid these are not taxes owed by average Americans. We don't have an alternative. We'll lose it when it's taken out of our paycheck before we even get it. But it's the Internal Revenue Service which estimates now that we aren't collecting $100 billion or more in taxes owed in this country. And that is just absolutely unfair to the vast majority of Americans who pay their taxes and pay them on time. The Dorgan Task Force, which included two internal revenue commissioners, one a Republican, one a Democrat. It was a bipartisan commission, a study by two respected economists, which indicated that we could collect some 40, 45, 50 billion dollars of those funds. The point is you've got to have a president who's prepared to do this and to begin right away and, preferably, a president who was a governor of a state that's had very, very successful experience at doing this. In my own state, we did it. In other states, we've done it. Republican governors as well as Democratic governors. And we've had great success at revenue enforcement. Now, the Vice President will probably tell you that it's going to take an army of IRS collectors again. Well, his campaign manager, who used to be the secretary of the treasury, was taking great credit about a year ago and asking and receiving from the Congress substantial additional funds to hire internal revenue agents to go out and collect these funds, and I'm happy to join Jim Baker in saying that we agree on this. But, the fact of the matter is that this is something that we must begin it's going to take at least the first year of the new administration. But, the Dorgan Task Force, the bipartisan task force estimated that we could collect about $35 billion in the fifth year, $105 billion over five years, the other study even more than that SHAW: Governor. DUKAKIS: and that's where you begin. SHAW: One minute response, Mr. Vice President. BUSH: Well, Andrea, you didn't predicate that lack of economists' support for what I call a flexible freeze, because some good very good economists do support that concept. And I think where I differ with the Governor of Massachusetts, because I am optimistic. They jumped on me yesterday for being a little optimistic about the United States. I am optimistic and I believe we can keep this longest expansion going. I was not out there when that stock market dropped wringing my hands and saying this was the end of the world as some political leaders were, because it isn't the end of the world. And what we have to do is restrain the growth of spending. And we are doing a better job of it. The Congress is doing a better job of it. And the dynamics work. But they don't work if you go raise taxes and then the Congress spends it continues to spend that. The American working man and woman are not taxed too little. The Federal Government continues to spend too much. (Applause) BUSH: Hold it. SHAW: Mr. Vice President, Andrea has a question for you. MITCHELL: Mr. Vice President, you have flatly ruled out any change in Social Security benefits, even for the wealthy. Now, can you stand here tonight and look at a whole generation of 18 to 34 year olds in the eye the very people who are going to have to be financing that retirement and tell them that they should be financing the retirement of people like yourself, like Governor Dukakis, or for that matter, people such as ourselves here on this panel? BUSH: More so you than me. MITCHELL: We could argue about that. BUSH: No, but you got to go back to what social security was when it was created. It wasn't created as a welfare program. It wasn't created that is it was created as a whole retirement or supplement to retirement program. It wasn't created as a welfare program. So, here's what's happened. We came into office and the Social Security Trust Fund was in great jeopardy and the President took the leadership working with the Democrats and the Republicans in Congress some tough calls were made and the Social Security Trust Fund was put back into sound, solvent condition. So, I don't want to fool around with it. And there are several there's a good political reason because it's just about this time of year that the Democrats start saying the Republicans are going to take away your Social Security. It always works that way. I've seen it. In precinct politics in Texas and I've seen it at the national level. We have made the Social Security Trust Fund sound. And it is going to be operating at surpluses and I don't want the liberal Democratic Congress to spend out of that Social Security Trust Fund or go and take the money out for some other purpose. I don't want that. And I will not go in there and suggest changes in Social Security. I learned that the hard way and the Governor and I both supported slipping the COLAs for one year. He supported it at the National Governors Conference and I supported it in breaking a tie in a major compromise package and we got assailed by the Democrats in the election over that. And I am going to keep that Social Security Trust Fund sound and keep our commitment to the elderly and maybe down the line, maybe when you get two decades or one into the next century, you're going to have to take another look at it, but not now. We do not have to do it. Keep the trust with the older men and women of this country. SHAW: Governor, you have one minute, sir. DUKAKIS: Andrea, I don't know which George Bush I'm listening to. George Bush, a few years ago, said that Social Security was basically a welfare system. BUSH: Oh, come on. DUKAKIS: And in 1985, he flew back from the West Coast to cut that COLA. I voted against that at the National Governors Association. We won a majority, we didn't win the two-thirds that was necessary nor to pass that resolution, George. But everybody knew what we were doing and I've opposed that. The reason that we raise concerns, not just in election years, but every year, because Republicans, once they're elected and start cutting. You did it in 1985. The Administration tried to do it repeatedly, repeatedly in 81 82. And I'm sure you'll try to do it again. Because there's no way you can finance what you want to spend. There's no way you can pay for that five year, $40 billion tax cut for the rich and still buy all those weapons systems you want to buy unless you raid the Social Security Trust Fund. (Applause) SHAW: Ann Compton for the Vice President. COMPTON: Mr. Vice President, there are three Justices on the Supreme Court who are in their 80's and it's very likely that the next President will get a chance to put a lasting mark on the Supreme Court. For the record, would your nominees to the Supreme Court have to pass something that has been called a kind of conservative ideological litmus test and would you give us an idea of perhaps who two or three people on your short list are for the Court. BUSH: One I don't have a list yet. I feel pretty confident tonight, but not that confident. (Laughter) BUSH: Secondly, I don't have any litmus test. But what I would do is appoint people to the Federal Bench that will not legislate from the Bench, who will interpret the Constitution. I do not want to see us go to again and Fm using this word advisedly a liberal majority that is going to legislate from the Bench. They don't like the use of the word, but may I remind his strong supporters that only last year in the primary, to capture that Democratic nomination, he said, ""I am a progressive liberal Democrat."" I won't support judges like that. There is no litmus test on any issue. But I will go out there and find men and women to interpret. And I don't have a list, but I think the appointments that the President has made to the Bench have been outstanding, outstanding appointments. COMPTON: Including Bork? BUSH: Yeah. I supported him. (Applause) DUKAKIS: If the Vice President of the United States thinks that Robert Bork was an outstanding appointment (Cheers and Applause) DUKAKIS: that is a very good reason for voting for Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen on the 8th of November. (Cheers and Applause) DUKAKIS: And I think the Vice President supported the Bork nomination. You know, Mr. Bush has never appointed a judge. I've appointed over 130, so I have a record. (Laughter) DUKAKIS: And I'm very proud of it. I don't ask people whether they're Republicans or Democrats. I've appointed prosecutors, I've appointed defenders. I don't appoint people I think are liberal or people who think - who I think are conservative. I appoint people of independence and integrity and intelligence, people who will be a credit to the Bench. And those are the standards that I will use in nominating people to the Supreme Court of the United States. These appointments are for life. These appointments are for life. And when the Vice President talks about liberals on the Bench, I wonder who he's talking about? Is he talking about a former Governor of the State of California, who is a former prosecutor, a Republican named Earl Warren, because I think Chief Justice Earl Warren was an outstanding Chief Justice and I think most Americans do too. SHAW: Ann Compton has a question for you, Governor Dukakis. COMPTON: Governor, millions of Americans are entitled to some of the protections and benefits that the Federal Government provides, including Social Security, pensions, Medicare for the elderly, Medicaid for the poor. But in fact, there are so many millions of Americans who are eligible the government just can't continue to pay for all of those programs as they're currently constituted. A blue ribbon panel shortly after the election is likely to recommend that you go where the money is when you make budget cuts, and that means entitlements. Before the election would you commit yourself to any of those hard choices, such as which one of those entitlements have to be redrawn? DUKAKIS: Andrea, why do people who want balanced budgets or to bring the deficit down always go to those programs which tend to benefit people of very modest means? Now, two-thirds of the people in this country who receive Social Security checks live entirely on that check; they have no other income. And yet Mr. Bush tried to cut their cost of living increase in 1985. Medicare is not getting less expensive; medical care for the elderly is getting more expensive, with greater deductibles, with fewer benefits, the kinds of things we've had under this Administration that have cut and chopped and reduced the kind of benefits that one gets under Medicare. Yes, we now have catastrophic health insurance, but it's going to cost, and that's going to be an additional burden on elderly citizens. It had bipartisan support; it should have had bipartisan support. But I suggest that we understand that those are going to be additional costs on senior citizens across this country. So I'm not going to begin, and I'm not going to go to entitlements as a means for cutting that deficit when we're spending billions on something like Star Wars, when we're spending billions on other weapon systems which apparently the Vice President wants to keep in his back pocket or some place, but which, if we continue to spend billions on them, will force us to cut Social Security, to cut Medicare, to cut these basic entitlements to people of very, very modest means. Now there are some things we can do to help people who currently do get entitlements to get off public assistance. I talked in our first debate about the possibilities of helping millions and millions of welfare families to get off of welfare, and I'm proud to say that we finally have a welfare reform bill And the Ruby Samsons and Dan Lawsons, hundreds of thousands of welfare mothers in this country and in my state and across the country who today are working and earning are examples of what can happen when you provide training to those welfare mothers, some daycare for their children so that those mothers can go into a training program and get a decent job. SHAW: Governor DUKAKIS: That's the way you bring a deficit down and help to improve the quality of life for people at the same time. SHAW: One minute for the Vice President. BUSH: I think I've addressed it. But let me simply say for the record, I did not vote to cut COLAs. And I voted the same way that he did three months before in a national governors' conference. And he said at that time, in a quote, and this is a paraphrase, a freeze, that's easy. So I don't believe that we need to do what you've suggested here. And I've said that I'm going to keep this Social Security entitlement, to keep that trust fund sound. But I do think there are flexible ways to solve some of the pressing problems, particularly that affect our children. And I have made some good sound proposals. But again, we have a big difference on child care, for example. You see, I want the families to have the choice. I don't want to see the Federal Government licensing grandmothers. I don't want to see the Federal Government saying to communities, well, you can't do this any more. We're going to tell you how to do it all. I want flexibility, and I do you know, these people laugh about the thousand points of light. You ought to go out and see around this country what's happening in the volunteer section: Americans helping America. And I want to keep it alive in child care and in other entitlements. SHAW: Margaret Warner for Gov. Dukakis. WARNER: Governor, I'm going to pass on the question I originally planned to ask you, to follow up on your rebuttal to a question Andrea asked, and that involves Social Security. Now it is true, as you said, that originally you sought an exemption for Social Security COLAs in this national governors' association vote. But when you lost that vote, you then endorsed the overall freeze proposal. And what's more, you had great criticism of your fellow governors who wouldn't go along as political cowards. DUKAKIS: That is absolutely not true. WARNER: You said it takes guts and it takes will. DUKAKIS: That is absolutely not true. It had nothing to do with the debate on Social Security. It had to do with the discussion we had had the previous day on the overall question of reducing the budget. WARNER: My question is: Aren't you demagoguing the Social Security issue? DUKAKIS: No, and I have to (Applause) DUKAKIS: I just have to correct the record. That simply isn't true. Now, we're not a parliamentary body, the National Governors Association. We vote on resolutions. If you don't get a two-thirds, then your resolution doesn't pass. But everybody knew that those of us who voted against the freezing of COLAs did so, we did so emphatically. And I never made that statement; never would. The point is that as we look at this nation's future, and we have two very different visions of this future. I want to move ahead. The Vice President talks about a thousand points of light. I'm interested in 240 million points of light. I'm interested in 240 million citizens in this country who share in the American dream, all of them in every part of this country. But as we look at the decisions that the next president of the United States is going to have to make, I just don't believe the place you go first is those programs, those so-called entitlements, which provide a basic floor of income and a modest amount of medical care for the elderly, the disabled, for people who can't make their way on their own, and in many cases, have given a great deal to this country. The Vice President did call Social Security a few years ago basically or largely a welfare program. It isn't. It's a contract between generations. It's something that we pay into now so that we will have a secure retirement, and our parents and grandparents will have a secure retirement. It's a very sacred contract, and I believe in it. So that's not where we ought to go. There are plenty of places to cut. There's lots we can do in the Pentagon where dishonest contractors have been lining their pockets at the expense of the American taxpayer. There are we certainly ought to be able to SHAW: Governor DUKAKIS: Give our farm families a decent income with spending $20to $25 billion a year on farm subsidies, and I'm sure we can do that. That's where we ought to go, and those are the programs we ought to review first. SHAW: One minute for the Vice President. BUSH: Well, let me take him up on this question of farm subsidies. We have a fundamental difference, approach on agriculture. He favors this supply maintenance or production controls. He said that. He's been out in the state saying that, in Midwestern states. I don't. I think the farm bill that he criticizes was good legislation, outstanding legislation. And I believe the answer to the agricultural economy is not to get the government further involved, but to do what I'm suggesting. In the first place, never go back to that Democratic grain embargo, that liberal Democrat grain embargo that knocked the markets right out from under us and made Mr. Gorbachev say to me when I was here, how do I know you're reliable suppliers? We never should go back to that. And we ought to expand our markets abroad. We ought to have rural enterprise zones. We ought to move forward swiftly on my ideas of ethanol which would use more corn, and therefore, create a bigger market for our agricultural products. But let's not go back and keep assailing a farm bill that passed with overwhelming Democrat and Republican support. SHAW: Mr. Vice President. BUSH: The farm payments are going down because the agricultural economy is coming back. SHAW: Margaret Warner has a question for you, Mr. Vice President. WARNER: Mr. Vice President, I'd like to cover a subject that wasn't covered in the first debate. You have said in this campaign, I am an environmentalist, and described yourself as having zero tolerance for polluters. And yet your record does seem to suggest otherwise. When you were head of the President's task force on regulatory relief, you did urge EPA to relax regulations involving the elimination of lead from gasoline. I believe you urged suspension of rules requiring industries to treat toxic waste before discharging them in sewers. And your group also urged OSHA to weaken the regulations requiring that workers be informed of dangerous chemicals at the work site. Finally, I believe you did support the President's veto of the Clean Water Act. My question is, aren't you--how do you square your campaign rhetoric with this record? BUSH: 90 percent reductions in lead since I chaired that regulatory task force; 90 percent. It's almost you remember that expression, get the lead out? It's almost out. Almost gone. Clean water? I'm for clean water. But what I'm not for what I'm not for is measuring it the way that the Democratic Congress does. We sent up a good bill on clean water, a sound bill on clean water. But the only way you can express your love for clean water is to double the appropriations for clean water, and then rant against the deficit. I am for clean water. I've been an outdoorsman and a sportsman all my life. I've been to these national parks. I led for the Earl Wallop bill or formerly Dingell-Johnson. I headed the task force when I was a member of the Congress way back in the late '60s on these kinds of things, on the Republican side. I led for that. And so I refuse to measure one's commitment as to whether you're going to double the spending. That is the same old argument that's gotten us into trouble on the deficit side. So I'll just keep saying, I am one. I'm not going to go down there and try to dump the sludge from Massachusetts off the beaches off of New Jersey. I'm not going","elec-deb-60-to-16"
"11_1984","RIDINGS: Good evening from the Civic Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I'm Dorothy Ridings, president of the League of Women Voters, the sponsor of tonight's vice-presidential debate between Republican George Bush and Democrat Geraldine Ferraro. Our panelists for tonight's debate are John Mashek, correspondent for U.S. News &amp; World Report; Jack White, correspondent for Time magazine; Norma Quarles, correspondent for NBC News; and Robert Boyd, Washington bureau chief for Knight-Ridder Newspapers. Sander Vanocur, senior political correspondent for ABC News, is our moderator tonight. Sandy. VANOCUR: Thank you, Dorothy. A few words about the order of our format tonight. The order of questioning was determined by a toss of the coin. Congresswoman Ferraro won the toss. She elected to speak last. Therefore Vice President Bush will get the first question. The debate will be built upon a series of questions from the four reporters on the panel. A reporter will ask a candidate a question, a follow-up question and then the same to the other candidate; then each candidate will get to rebut the other. The debate will be divided into two parts. There'll be a section, the first: one, on domestic affairs; the second on foreign affairs. Now the manner of address was decided by the candidates. Therefore it will be Vice President Bush, Congresswoman Ferraro. And we begin our questioning with Mr. Mashek. MASHEK: John Adams, our nation's first vice-president, once said: ""Today I am nothing. Tomorrow I may be everything."" With that in mind, I'd like to ask the following question: Vice President Bush, four years ago, you ran against Mr. Reagan for the Republican nomination. You disagreed with him on such issues as the Equal Rights Amendment, abortion, and you labeled his economic policies as voodoo. Now you apparently agree with him on every issue. If you should be called upon to assume the presidency, would you follow Mr. Reagan's policies down the line or would you revert to some of your own ideas. BUSH: Well, I don't think there's a great difference, Mr. Mashek, between my views and President Reagan's. One of the reasons I think we're an effective team is that I believe firmly in his leadership. He's really turned this country around. We agree on the economic program. When we came into office, why, inflation was 21, 12 1/2 percent interest was wiping out every single American were 21 1/2 percent if you can believe it. Productivity was down. Savings was down. There was despair. In fact, the leadership of the country told the people that there was a malaise out there. And this president turned it around and I've been with him every step of the way. And of course I would continue those kinds of programs because it's brought America back. America's better off. People are going back to work. And why Mr. Monad can't understand that there's a new enthusiasm in this country, that America is back, there's new strong leadership, I don't know. He has one answer to the problem. Raise everybody's taxes. He looked right into that lens and he said out there in San Francisco, he said, ""I'm gonna raise your taxes."" Well he's had a lot of experience in that and he's sure gonna go ahead and do it. But I remember a statement of Lyndon Johnson's when he was looking around, why his party people weren't supporting him, and he said, ""Hey, they painted their tails white and they ran with the antelopes."" There's a lot of Democratic white tails running with the antelopes. Not one single Democrat has introduced the Mondale tax bill into the Congress. Of course I support the president's economic program and I support him in everything else. And I'm not sure, because of my concept of the vice presidency, that if I didn't, I'd go doing what Mr. Mondale has done with Jimmy Carter; jump away from him. I couldn't do that to Ronald Reagan, now, next year or any other time. I have too much trust in him. I have too much friendship for him. And I'd feel very uncomfortable doing that. MASHEK: Well some Republicans have criticized Mr. Mondale for now claiming he disagreed privately with Jimmy Carter's decision to impose the grain embargo. Have you ever disagreed with any decision of the Reagan Administration and its inner circles? And in following that up, where in your judgment does loyalty end and principle begin? BUSH: I owe my president my judgment and then I owe him loyalty. You can't have the president of the United States out there looking over his shoulder wondering whether his vice president is going to be supporting him. Mrs. Ferraro has quite a few differences with Vice-President Mondale and I understood it when she changed her position on tuition tax credits. They're different on busing; she voted to extend the grain embargo; he now says that he was against it. If they win - and I hope they don't - but if they win, she'll have to accommodate some views. But she'll give him the same kind of loyalty that I'm giving President Reagan. One, we're not far apart on anything. Two, I can walk into that Oval Office anytime and give him my judgment and he might agree or he might not. But he also knows I won't be talking about it to the press or I won't be knifing him in the back by leaking to make me look good and complicate the problems of the president of the United States. MASHEK: Congresswoman Ferraro, your opponent has served in the House Of Representatives, he's been ambassador to the United Nations, ambassador to China, director of the Central Intelligence Agency and now he's been vice president for four years. How does your three terms in the House of Representatives stack up against experience like that? FERRARO: Well, let me first say that I wasn't born at the age of forty-three when I entered Congress. I did have a life before that as well. I was a prosecutor for almost five years in the district attorney's office in Queens County and I was a teacher. There's not only what is on your paper resume that makes you qualified to run for or to hold office. It's how you approach problems and what your values are. I think if one is taking a look at my career they'll see that I level with the people; that I approach problems analytically; that I am able to assess the various facts with reference to a problem, and I can make the hard decisions. I'm intrigued when I hear Vice-President Bush talk about his support of the president's economic program and how everything is just going so beautifully. I, too, recall when Vice President Bush was running in the primary against President Reagan and he called the program voodoo economics, and it was and it is. We are facing absolutely massive deficits; this administration has chosen to ignore it; the president has failed to put forth a plan to deal with those deficits and if everything believes that everything is corning up roses, perhaps the vice-president should join me as I travel around the country and speak to people. People in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, are not terribly thrilled with what's happening in the economy because they're standing in the light of a closed plant because they've lost their jobs. The people in Youngstown, Ohio, have stores that are boarded up because the economy is not doing well. It's not only the old industries that are failing, it's also the new ones. In San Jose, California, they're complaining because they can't export their high-tech qualities - goods - to Japan and other countries. The people in the Northwest - in the state of Washington and Oregon - are complaining about what's happening to the timber industry and to the agriculture industry. So, so things are not as great as the administration is wanting us to believe in their television commercials. My feeling, quite frankly, is that I have enough experience to see the problems, address them and make the tough decisions and level with people with reference to those problems. MASHEK: Despite the historic aspects of your candidacy, how do you account for the fact that a majority of women - at least according to the polls - favor the Reagan-Bush ticket over the Mondale-Ferraro ticket? FERRARO: I don't. Let me say that I'm not a believer in polls and let me say further that what we are talking about are problems that are facing the entire nation. They're not just problems facing women. The issues in this campaign are the war-peace issues; the problems of deficits; the problems of trade deficits. We are now facing a $120 billion trade deficit in this country. We're facing problems of the environment. I think what we're going to be doing over the next several weeks - and I'm absolutely delighted that the League is sponsoring these debates and that we are, we are able to now speak to the American public and address the issues in a way such as this. I think you're going to see a change in those polls. VANOCUR: Vice President Bush, you have one minute to rebuttal. BUSH: Well, I was glad to get that vote of confidence from Mrs. Ferraro in my economic judgment. So let me make a statement on the economy. The other clay she was in a plant and she said to the workers, Why are you all voting for, why are so many of you voting for the Reagan-Bush ticket. And there was a long, deathly silence and she said come on, we delivered. That's the problem. And I'm not blaming her except for the liberal voting record in the House. They delivered. They delivered 21 Â® percent interest rates. They delivered what they called malaise. They delivered interest rates that were right off the charts. They delivered take-home pay, checks that were shrinking, and we've delivered optimism. People are going back to work; 6 million of them. And 300,000 jobs a month being created. That's why there was that deathly silence out there in that plant. They delivered the wrong thing. Ronald Reagan is delivering leadership. VANOCUR: Congresswoman Ferraro, one-minute rebuttal. FERRARO: I, I think what I'm going to have to do is I'm going to start correcting the vice-president's statistics. There are 6 million more people who have jobs and that's supposed to happen in a growing economy. In fact in the prior administration, with all their problems, they created 10 million jobs. The housing interest rates during this administration, for housing for middle-class Americans, was 14.5 percent. Under the prior administration, with all their problems, the average rate was 10.6 percent. If you take a look at the number of people living in poverty as a result of this administration, 6 million people, 500,000 people knocked off disability rolls. You know, it's, you can walk around saying things are great and that's what we're going to be hearing, we've been hearing that on those commercials for the past couple of months. I expect they expect the American people to believe that. I'll become a one-woman truth squad and we'll start tonight. VANOCUR: Mr. White. WHITE: Congresswoman Ferraro, I would like to ask you about civil rights. You have in the past been a supporter of tuition tax credits for private parochial schools. And also of a constitutional amendment to ban busing. Both these measures are opposed not only by your running mate but by about every educational and civil rights organization in the country. Now that you're Mr. Mondale's running mate have you changed your position on either of those? FERRARO: With reference to the busing vote that I cast in 1979, both Fritz Mondale and I agree on the same goal and that is nondiscrimination. I just don't agree on the same direction he does on how to achieve it. But I don't find any problem with that. I think that's been something that's been handled by the courts, and not being handled by Congress and will not be handled by the White House. But we both support nondiscrimination in housing and integration of neighborhoods. The goals we both set forth. With reference to tuition tax credits, I have represented a district in Queens which is 70 percent Catholic. I represented my district. Let me say as well that I have also been a great supporter of public school education and that is something that Fritz and I feel very, very strongly about for the future of this country. And this administration over the past several years has gutted the educational programs available to our young people. It has attempted to knock out Pell Grants, which are monies to young individuals who are poor and who cannot afford to go to college. It has reduced by 25 percent the amount of monies going into college education and by a third those going into secondary and primary schools. But Fritz Mondale and I feel very strongly that if you educate your children that that's an effort and the way that you build up and make a stronger America. With reference to civil rights I think you've got to go beyond that and if you take a look, also, at my record in the Congress and Fritz Mondale's record, both in the Senate and as vice president, we both have extremely strong civil rights records. This administration does not. It has come in in the Bob Jones on the side of segregated academies. It came in in the Grove City case on the side of discrimination against women, the handicapped, and the elderly. As a matter of fact, in the Congress we just passed overwhelmingly the Civil Rights Bill of 1984 and this administration, the Republican-controlled Senate, just killed it in the last week or two in Congress. So there is a real difference between how the Mondale-Ferraro administration will address the problems of civil rights and the failure of this administration specifically in that particular area. WHITE: In the area of affirmative action, what steps do you think government can take to increase the representation of minorities and women in the work force, and in colleges and universities, and specifically, would you support the use of quotas to achieve those goals? FERRARO: I do not support the use of quotas. Both Mr. Mondale and I feel very strongly about affirmative action to correct inequities, and we believe that steps should be taken both through government - for instance, the Small Business Administration. We have supported set-asides for minority and women's businesses. That's a positive thing. We don't feel that you're in any way hurting anybody else by reaching out with affirmative action to help those who've been disenfranchised. On the contrary, if you have a growing economy, if you create the jobs, if you allow for small business the opportunity with lower interest rates to reach out and grow, there will be more than enough space for everybody. And affirmative action is a very positive way to deal with the problems of discrimination. WHITE: Vice-President Bush, many critics of your administration say that it is the most hostile to minorities in recent memory. Have you inadvertently perhaps encouraged that view by supporting tuition tax credits, the antibusing amendment, and siding with Bob Jones University in a case before the Supreme Court, your original opposition to the Voting Rights Act extension and so forth? BUSH: No, Mr. White, I think our record on civil rights is a good record. You mentioned the Voting Rights extension; it was extended for the longest period of time by President Reagan. But we have some problems in attracting the black vote, and I think our record deserves better. We have done more for black colleges than any previous administration. We favor enterprise zones to give - and it's been blocked by Tip O'Neill and that House of Representatives, those liberals in that House blocked a new idea to bring jobs into the black communities across the country. And because it's not an old handout, special federal spending program, it's blocked there - a good idea. And I'd like to sec that tried. We've brought more civil rights cases in the Justice Department than the previous administration by far. We believe in trying something new to help these black teenage kids; the minimum wage differential that says, ""Look,"" to an employer, ""hire these guys. And, yes, they're willing to work for slightly less than the minimum wage. Give 'em a training job in the private sector."" We threw out that old CETA that didn't train people for jobs that existed, simply rammed them onto the government payroll, and we put in a thing called the Job Training Partnership Act. Wonderful new legislation that's helping blacks more and more. We think of civil rights as something like crime in your neighborhoods. And, for example, when crime figures are going in the right direction that's good, that's a civil right. Similarly, we think of it in terms of quality of life, and that means interest rates. You know, it's funny, Mr. Mondale talks about real interest rates. The real interest rate is what you pay when you go down and try to buy a TV set or buy a car, or do whatever it is. The interest rates when we left office were 21% percent. Inflation! Is it a civil right to have the going right off the chart so you're busting every American family, those who can afford it the least? No, we've got a good record. We've got it on civil rights legislation, minority set-asides, more help for black colleges, and we've got it in terms of an economy that's offering people opportunity and hope instead of despair. WHITE: Along those lines, sir, many recent studies have indicated that the poor and minorities have not really shared in the new prosperity generated by the current economic recovery. Was it right for your administration to pursue policies, economic policies, that required those at the bottom of the economic ladder to wait for prosperity to trickle clown from people who are much better off than they? BUSH: Mr. White, it's not trickling down. And I'm not suggesting there's no poverty, but I am suggesting the way to work out of poverty is through real opportunity. And in the meantime, the needy are getting more help. Human resource spending is way, way up. Aid for Dependent Children spending is up. Immunization programs are up. Almost every place you can point, contrary to Mr. Mondale's - I gotta be careful - but contrary of how he goes around just saying everything bad. If somebody sees a silver lining, he finds a big black cloud out there. Whine on harvest moon! I mean, there's a lot going on, a lotta opportunity. VANOCUR: Congresswoman Ferraro, your rebuttal. FERRARO: The vice-president indicates that the President signed the Voting Rights Act. That was after he was - he did not support it while it was in the Congress, in the Senate, it was passed despite his opposition, and he did sign it because he was required to do so. In the civil rights cases that he mentioned, the great number of cases that they have enforced, the reason they enforced them because under the law they're required to do that. And I'm delighted that the administration is following the law. With reference VANOCUR: Excuse me - this will be out of my time, not yours - knowing and cherishing the people of this city and knowing their restraint and diffidence about emotion especially of athletic contexts of which this is not one, I beseech you, try to hold your applause please. I'm sorry. FERRARO: I just have to correct in my thirty seconds that are left the comment that the vice-president made with reference specifically to a program like AFDC. If you take AFDC, if you take food stamps, if you take - oh, go down the line on poor people's programs, those are the programs that suffered considerably under this administration's first budget cuts and those are the ones that in the second part of their part of their term, we were able to restore some of those terribly, terribly unfair cuts to the poor people of this country. VANOCUR: Vice-President Bush. BUSH: Well, maybe we have a factual - maybe we can ask the experts to go to the books. They'll do it anyway. Spending for food stamps is way, way up under the Reagan administration, AFDC is up under the Reagan administration, and I'm not going to be found wrong on that. I am sure of my facts, and we are trying to help and I think we're doing a reasonable job, but we are not going to rest until every single American that wants a job and until this prosperity and this recovery that's benefiting many Americans, benefits all Americans. VANOCUR: Miss Quarles. QUARLES: Vice-President Bush, one of the most emotional issues in this campaign has been the separation of church and state. What are your views on the separation of church and state specifically with regard to abortion, and do you believe it was right for the archbishop of Philadelphia to have a letter read in 305 churches urging Catholics to fight abortion with their votes? BUSH: I do believe in pluralism. I do believe in separation of church and state. I don't consider abortion a religious issue. I consider it a moral issue. I believe the archbishop has every right to do everything he wants in that direction, just as I never faulted Jesse Jackson from taking his message to the black pulpits all across this country, just as I never objected when the nuclear arms, the nuclear freeze or the antinuclear people - many of those movements were led by priests. Suddenly, because a Catholic bishop or an evangelist feels strongly on a political issue, people are saying it's merging of church and state. We favor - and I speak confidently for the president - we favor separation of church and state. We favor pluralism. Now somebody says you ought to restore prayer in schools. You don't think it's right to prohibit a kid from praying in schools. For years kids were allowed to pray in schools. We don't think that's a merger of church and stare to have nonmandatory voluntary, nongovernment-ordered prayer. And yet some are accusing us of injecting religion into politics. I have no problem with what the archbishop does, and I have no problem with what the evangelists on the right do and I have no problem what the priests on the left do. And it didn't bother me when during the Vietnam War much of the opposition to the government - Democrat and Republican governments - was led by priests, encouraging people to break the law and the adage of the - you know - the civil disobedience thing. So our position, separation of church and stare, pluralism, so no little kid with a minority religion of some sort is going to feel offended or feel left out or feel uncomfortable. But, yes, prayer in school on a voluntary basis worked for many, many years until the Supreme Court ruled differently And I'm glad we got this question because I think there's been too much said about religion and politics. We don't believe in denominationally moving in. It wasn't our side that raised the question about our president whether he was a good Christian or not and so I, so that's our position - separation of church and state, pluralism, respect for all. QUARLES: Vice-President Bush, four years ago you would have allowed federal financing of abortions in cases of rape and incest ass well as when the mother's life was threatened. Does your position now agree with Reagan who in Sunday's debate came very close to saying abortion is murder? BUSH: You know, there has been - I have to make a confession - an evolution in my position. There's been 15 million abortions since 1973, and I don't take that lightly. There's been a million and a half this year. The president and I do favor a human rights amendment. I favor one that would have an exception for incest and rape, and he doesn't, but we both - only for the life of the mother. And I agree with him on that. So yes, my position's evolved, but I'd like to see the American who faced with 15 million abortions isn't rethinking his or her position and I'll just stand with the answer. I support the president's position - and comfortably - from a moral standpoint. QUARLES: So you believe it's akin to murder? BUSH: No, I support the president's position. QUARLES: Fine. Congresswoman Ferraro, what are your views on the separation of church and state with regard to abortions, and do you believe it was right for the archbishop of Philadelphia to have those letters read in the pulpits and urged the voters to fight abortion with their vote? FERRARO: Let me say first of all I believe very, very sincerely in the separation of church and state. I'm taking it from the historical viewpoint, if you go back to the 1600s when people came here, the reason they came to this country was to escape religious persecution, and that's the same reason why people are coming here today in the 1940s to escape Nazism, now in the 1980s and 1984 when they can get our of the country to escape communism so they can come here and practice their religion. Our country is founded on the principle that our government should be neutral as far as religion is concerned. Now what's happened over the past several years, and quite frankly I'm not going to let you lay on me the intrusion of state politics into religion or religion into politics by my comments with reference to the president's policies, because it started in 1980 when this administration was running for office and the Reverend Jerry Falwell became very, very involved in the campaign. What has happened over the past four years has been I think a real fudging of that line with the separation of church and state. The actions of the archbishops let me say to you I feel that they have not only a right but a responsibility to speak up, and even though I've been the person that they're speaking up about, l feel they do have the responsibility to do so, and I have no problem with it, no more than I did a priest who marched at the time of Vietnam and no more than I did at the time when Martin Luther King marched at the time of the civil rights marches. I have absolutely no problem with them speaking up, I think they have an obligation as well as a right. But what I do have a problem with is when the president of the United States gets up in Dallas and addresses a group of individuals and said to them that anybody who doesn't support his constitutional amendment for prayer in the schools is intolerant of religion. Now there are numerous groups who don't support that prayer in the school, numerous religious groups. Are they intolerant of religion? Is that what the president is saying? I also object, when I am told, that the Reverend Falwell has been told that he would pick two of our Supreme Court justices. That's going a little bit far. In that instance, let me say to you it is more than a fudging at the line, it is a total intrusion, and I think that it's in violation of our Constitution. QUARLES: Congresswoman Ferraro, as a devout Catholic, does it trouble you that so many of the leaders of your church disagree with you, and do you think that you're being treated unfairly in any way by the Catholic church? FERRARO: Let me tell you that I did not come to my position on abortion very lightly. I am a devout Catholic. When I was running for Congress 1978 I sat and met with a person I felt very close to, a monsignor currently a bishop. I spoke to him about my personal feelings that I would never have an abortion, but I was not quite sure if I were ever to become pregnant as result of a rape if I would be that self-righteous. I then spoke to him; he said, Gerry, that's not good enough. There you can't support that position. I said okay. That's my religious view; I will accept the teaching of the church, but I cannot impose my religious views on someone else. I truly take an oath as a public official to represent all the people in my district, not only the Catholics. If there comes a time where I cannot practice my religion and do my job properly, I will resign my job. VANOCUR: Vice-President Bush, your rebuttal. BUSH: Well I respect that statement, I really and truly do. We have difference on a moral question here on abortion. I notice that Mr. Mondale keeps talking in the debate and now it's come here about Mr. Falwell. And I don't know where this canard could have come from about Mr. Falwell picking the Supreme Court justices. Ronald Reagan has made one super outstanding, the only one he's made, appointment to the Supreme Court and that was Sandra Day O'Connor, and Mr. Falwell opposed her nomination. We still have respect for him, but he opposed it, and so I hope this lays to rest this slander against the president. We want justices who will interpret the Constitution, not legislate it. VANOCUR: Congresswoman Ferraro, your rebuttal? FERRARO: Yes, I still find it very difficult to believe because in the platform, which this Republican party passed in Dallas - one of the things they was they said that this position on abortion would be a litmus test, not only for Supreme Court justices but for other federal justices. That, again, seems to me a blurring of the line of the separation between church and state. VANOCUR: The next questioning from Mr. Boyd. BOYD: Like many Americans, each of you has recently had an unhappy experience with the Internal Revenue Service. I'm going to prolong your ordeal. Congresswoman Ferraro, you disagree with the rule that says that a candidate must report the income or assets of his or her spouse if you get any benefit from them. Your husband's tax return showed that yon did benefit because he paid the mortgage and the property taxes on your home. Now the ethics committee is examining this question, but it won't report it's findings until after the election. Would you be willing to ask that committee, which is controlled by Democrats, to hurry up its work and report before the election. FERRARO: Let me say to you that I already did that. I wanted them to move ahead. If you recall, I spent about an hour and 45 minutes speaking to 200 reporters on August 21, which is the day after I was required to file my financial statement, and I sat for as long as they had questions on the issue, and I believe that they were satisfied. I filed more information than any other candidate for a national office in the history of this country. Not only did I agree to file my tax returns, after a little bit of prodding my husband also agreed to file his with the - not only the ethics committee but the FEC. Bur the action that you're speaking about with the ethics committee was started by a right-wing legal organization - foundation - knowing that I would have to - that there would be an automatic inquiry. We have filed the necessary papers, I have asked them to move along. Unfortunately, the House, I believe, went out of session today, so I don't know if they will move. But quite frankly, I would like that to be taken care of anyway, because I just want it cleared up. BOYD: Since that famous August 21 press conference on your family finances, you filed a new report with the ethics committee, and this showed that your previous reports were full of mistakes and omissions. For example, you failed to report about twelve trips that were paid for by special interest groups. In at least eighteen cases your holdings were misstated. Do you think it showed good leadership or attention to duty to blame all this on sloppy work by your accountant? FERRARO: Well, what it showed was that - and it was truly that I hired an accountant who had been with our family for well over forty years. He was filling our those ethics forms. I did not spend the time with him - I just gave him my tax information and he did it. I have to tell you what we have done since I have hired a marvelous accountant. I've spent a lot of money having him go through all those ethics forms and he will be doing my taxes over the next eight years while we're in the White House so that the American public can be sure it's all been taken care of. BOYD: Vice-President Bush, last year you paid less than 13 percent of your income in federal taxes. According to the IRS, someone in your bracket normally pays about 28 percent of his income. Now what you did was perfectly legal, but do you think it was fair, and is there something wrong with our tax laws that allows such large deductions for wealthy taxpayers? BUSH: What that figure - and I kind of like the way Mrs. Ferraro and Mr. Zaccaro reported - because they reported federal taxes, state and local taxes - gives people a clearer picture. That year I happened to pay a lot of state and local taxes, which as you know are deducted from the other, and so I looked it up the other day, and we had paid - I think it's 42 percent - of our gross income in taxes. Now Mr. Mondale the other night took what I - I'll be honest - I think it was a cheap shot - at me, and we did a little looking around to see about his. We can't find his 198I tax return - it may have been released. Maybe my opponent knows whether Mr. Mondale released it. But we did find estimates that his income for those three years is a million, four hundred thousand dollars, and I think he paid about the same percentage as I did in total taxes. He also made a reference that troubled me very much, Mr. Boyd. He started talking about my chauffeur, and you know, I'm driven to work by the Secret Service - so is Mrs. Ferraro - so is Mr. Mondale - they protected his life for four years and now they've done a beautiful job for Barbara and mine. They saved the life of the president of the United States. I think that was a cheap shot - telling the American people to try to divide class - rich and poor. But the big question isn't whether Mrs. Ferraro is doing well. I think they're doing pretty well, and I know Barbara and I are doing well. And it's darn sure that Mr. Mondale is doing well, with a million four in income, but the question really is - after we get through this disclosure - is the tax cut fair? Are people getting a fair break, and the answer is the rich are paying 6 percent more on taxes and the poor are getting a better break. Those lower and middle-income people that have borne the burden for a long time. So yes, I favor disclosure. I've always disclosed. This year I had my taxes and everything I own in a blind trust - so blind - blinder than the president's, so I didn't even sign my tax return. But there seemed to be an interest in it so we went to the government ethics committee - they agreed to change the trust. The trust has been revealed, and I was sure glad to see that I had paid 42 percent of my gross income in taxes. BOYD: Mr. Vice-President, how can you claim that your home is in Maine for tax purposes and at the same time claim that your home is in Texas for voting purposes? Are you really a Texan or a New Englander. BUSH: I'm really a Texan. But I got one house. And under the law, every taxpayer is allowed, when he sells a house, and buys another house, to get the rollover. Everybody, if it turns out, and I may hire, I notice she said she has a new good accountant. I'd like to get his name and phone number because I think I've paid too much in the way of taxes. And residence, Mr. Boyd, legal residence, for voting, is very different. And the domicile, they call that, very different, than the house. That they say you're living in the vice-president's house. Therefore you don't get what every - I've got problems - what every other taxpayer gets. I got problems with the IRS, but so do a lot of people out there. I think I've paid too much. Nothing ethical. I'd like to get some money back. VANOCUR: Congresswoman Ferraro, your rebuttal please. FERRARO: Let me just say that I'd be happy to give the vice-president the name of my accountant, but I warn you, he's expensive. I think the question is whether or not the tax cuts and the tax system that's currently in our government, that our government uses, is fair; I think the tax system is unfair. But it's not something that we can address in the short term. The tax cuts that Vice-President Bush and I got last, three years ago, that this president gave out, no, that's not fair. If you earn $200,000 a year, you got a $25,000 tax cut. If you earned between $20,000 and $40,000, you may have gotten about $1,000 between ten and twenty, close to a hundred dollars and if you made less than $10,000 with all the budget cuts that came down the line, you suffered a loss of $400. That's not fair. That's basically unfair and not only is it unfair, but economically it has darn near destroyed this country. There's a $750 billion tax cut over a five-year period of time. That's one of the reasons we're facing these enormous deficits that we have today. VANOCUR: Mr. Vice-President. BUSH: No, I think I've said all I want to say. I do, I didn't fully address myself to Mr. Boyd's question no disclosure, I led the fight, I think, in 1968, in the House - I was in the House of Representatives for a couple of terms - and I led the fight for disclosure. I believe in it. Before I went into this job, I disclosed everything we had. We didn't have any private corporations, but I disclosed absolutely everything. Arthur Andersen made out an assets and liabilities statement that I believe went further than any other one. And then, to protect the public interest, we went into this blind trust. I believe in the blind trust because I believe a public official in this kind of job ought not to know whether he's gonna benefit, directly or indirectly, by some holding he might have or something of that nature. And, no, I support full disclosure. VANOCUR: Thank you. That ends the part of this debate devoted to domestic affairs. We will now turn to foreign affairs and will begin the questioning with Mr. Mashek. MASHEK: Vice-President Bush, since your administration came to power the President has threatened a stern response against terrorism, yet murderous attacks have continued in Lebanon and the Middle East. Who's to blame, and you've been director of the Central Intelligence Agency. What can be clone to stop it? BUSH: Terrorism is very, very difficult to slop. And I think everybody knows that. We had ambassadors killed in Sudan and the Lebanon some time ago, a long time ago. When you see the Israeli building in Lebanon after the death of our marines you see that, hit by terrorism, the Israelis, with all their experience fighting terrorism, you know it's difficult. When you see Khomeini wraith his radical Islam resorting to government-sponsored terrorism, it's very difficult. The intelligence business can do a good job, and I'm always one that defends the Central Intelligence Agency. I believe we ought to strengthen it and I believe we still have the best foreign intelligence business in the world. But it is very difficult to get the source information that you need to go after something as shadowy as international terror. There was a difference between Iran and what happened in Lebanon. In Iran you had a government holding a U.S. embassy; the government sanctioning the takeover of that embassy by those students; the government negotiating with the United States government for their release. In Lebanon, in the terror that happened at the embassy, you have the government there, Mr. Gemayel, that wants to help fight against terrorism. But because of the melee in the Middle East, it's there today and has been there yesterday and the day before, and everyone that's had experience in that area knows, it is a very different thing. So what we've got to do is use absolutely the best security possible. I don't think you can go assigning blame. The president, of course, is the best I've ever seen at accepting that. He's been wonderful about it in absolutely everything that happens. But I think fair-minded people that really understand international terror know that it's very hard to guard against. And the answer then really lies in the Middle East and terrorism happening all over the world, is a solution to the Palestine question, the follow on to Camp David under the umbrella of the Reagan September of 1982 initiative. That will reduce terror, it won't eliminate it. MASHEK: You mention Khomeini. Some Republicans charge the previous administration with being almost helpless against Khomeini and Libya's Quaddafi. Why hasn't your administration done something to take action against Arab states that foment this kind of terrorism? BUSH: What we've done is to support Arab stores that want to stand up against international terror, quite different. We believe in supporting, without jeopardizing the security of Israel in any way, because they are our one strategic ally in the area, they are the one democracy in the area and our relations with them has never been better. But we do believe in reaching out to the, what they call the GCC, those Gulf Cooperative Council State, those moderate Arab states in that world, and helping them with defensive weapons to guard against international terror or radical Islam perpetuated by Khomeini. And because we've done that and because the Saudis chopped down a couple of those intruding airplanes a while back, I think we have helped keep the peace in the Persian Gulf. MASHEK: Congresswoman Ferraro, you and former Vice-President Mondale have criticized the president over the bombings in Lebanon, but what would you do to prevent such attacks? FERRARO: Let me first say that terrorism is a global problem, and let me say secondly that the - Mr. Bush has referred to the embassy that was held in Iran, Well, I was at the White House in January, I guess it was, in '81, when those hostages, all fifty-two of them, came home alive. It was at that time that President Reagan gave a speech welcoming them home - as America did, we were so excited to see them back. But what he said was: The United States has been embarrassed for the last time. We're going to stand tall and if this ever happens again, there's going to be swift and immediate steps taken to address the wrong that our country has founded - has suffered. In April of J983 I was in Beirut and visited the ambassador at the embassy. Two weeks later, that embassy was bombed. At that time - take a look at the crazy activities of terrorists, you can't blame that on anybody. They're going to do crazy things and you just don't know what's going to happen. The following October, there was another bombing and that bombing took place at the marine barracks, where there were 242 young men who were killed. Right after that bombing occurred, there was a commission set up called the Long Commission. That commission did a study of the security arrangements around where the marines were sleeping and found that there was negligence, that they did not have proper gates up, proper precautions to stop those trucks from coming in. And so the Long Commission issued a report, and President Reagan got up and he said: I'm commander in chief. I take responsibility. And we all waited for something to be done when he look responsibility. Well, last month we had our third bombing, The first time, the first embassy, there was no gate up, The second time, with our Marines, the gate was open. The third time, the gate was there but it had not been installed. And what was the president's reaction? Well, the security arrangements were not in, our people were placed in that embassy in an unsecured time, and the marines who were guarding it were left to go away and there were other people guarding the embassy. Again the president said: I assume responsibility. I'd like to know what that means. Are we going to take proper precautions before we put Americans in situations where they're in danger, or are we just going to walk away, throwing our arms in the air now - quite a reversal from the first time, from the first time when he said he was going to do something? Or is this President going to take some action? MASHEK: Some Democrats cringe at the words spying and covert activity. Do you believe both of them have a legitimate role in countering terrorist activity around the world? FERRARO: I think they have a legitimate role in gathering information. And what has happened was the CIA, in the last bombing, had given information to our administration with reference to the actual threats that that embassy was going to be bombed. So it wasn't the CIA that was at fault. There's legitimate reason for the CIA to be in existence, and that's to gather intelligence information for our security. But when I see the CIA doing things like they're doing down in Central America - supporting a covert war - no, I don't support that kind of activity. The CIA is there, it's meant to protect our government; not there to subvert other governments. VANOCUR: Vice-President Bush. BUSH: Well, I'm surprised. I think I just heard Mrs. Ferraro say that she would do away with all covert actions, and if so, that has very serious ramifications, as the intelligence community knows. This is serious business. And sometimes it's quiet support for a friend, and so I'll leave that one there. But let me help you with the difference, Mrs. Ferraro, between Iran and the embassy in Lebanon. Iran - we were held by a foreign government. In Lebanon you had a wanton, terrorist action where the government opposed it. We went to Lebanon to give peace a chance, to stop the bombing of civilians in Beirut, to remove 13,000 terrorists from Lebanon - and we did. We saw the formation of a government of reconciliation and for somebody to suggest, as our two opponents have, that these men died in shame - they better not tell the parents of those young marines. They gave peace a chance. And our allies were with us - the British, the French, and the Italians. VANOCUR: Congresswoman Ferraro. FERRARO: Let me just say, first of all, that I almost resent, Vice President Bush, your patronizing attitude that you have to teach me about foreign policy. I've been a member of Congress for six years; I was there when the embassy was held hostage in Iran, and I have been there and I've seen what has happened in the past several months; seventeen months of your administration. Secondly, please don't categorize my answers, either. Leave the interpretation of my answers to the American people who are watching this debate. And let me say further that no one has ever said that those young men who were killed through the negligence of this administration and others ever died in shame. No one who has a child who is nineteen or twenty years old, a son, would ever say that at the loss of anybody else's child. VANOCUR: Mr. White. WHITE: Congresswoman Ferraro, you've repeatedly said that you would not want your son to die in an undeclared war for an uncertain cause. But recently your running mate, Mr. Mondale, has suggested that it may become necessary to erect a military quarantine or blockade of Nicaragua. Under what circumstances would you advocate the use of military force, American combat forces, in Central America? FERRARO: I would advocate the use of force when it was necessary to protect the security of our country, protect our security interest or protect our people or protect the interests of our friends and neighbors. When president - I'm jumping the gun a bit, aren't I? - when Mr. Mondale, Mr. Mondale referred to the quarantine of Central America, a country in Central America, what he is referring to is a last resort after all other means of attempting to settle the situation down in that region of the world had been exhausted. Quite frankly now what is being done by this administration is an Americanizing of a regional conflict. They're moving in militarily instead of promoting the Contadora process, which, as you know, is the process that is in place with the support of Mexico and Colombia and Panama and Venezuela. Instead of supporting the process, our administration has in Nicaragua been supporting covert activities to keep that revolution going in order to overthrow the Sandinista government; in El Salvador was not pushing the head of the government to move toward correction of the civil rights; human rights problems that existed there, and now this administration seems almost befuddled by the fact that Nicaragua is moving to participate in the Contadora process, and El Salvador is, through its President Duarte, is reaching out to the guerrillas in order to negotiate a peace. What Fritz Mondale and I feel about the situation down there is that what you do is you deal first through negotiation. That force is not a first resort but certainly a last resort in any instance. VANOCUR: A follow-up, please. WHITE: Many times in its history the United States has gone to war in order to defend freedom in other lands. Does your answer mean that you would be willing to forgo the use of military force even if it meant the establishment of a Soviet-back dictatorship so close to our own borders? FERRARO: No, I think what you have to do is work with the government - I assume you're speaking about the government of Nicaragua - work with that government to achieve a pluralistic society. I mean they do have elections that are coming up on November 4. I think we have to work with them to achieve a peaceful solution to bring about a pluralistic country. No, I'm not willing to live with a force that could be a danger to our country. Certainly, I would see that our country would be there putting all kinds of pressure on the neighboring countries of Honduras, of Costa Rica, of El Salvador, to promote the kind of society that we can all live with and security in this country. WHITE: Vice-President Bush, both Cuba and Nicaragua are reported to be making extensive preparations to defend themselves against an American invasion, which they claim could come this fall. And even some of your Democratic opponents in Congress have suggested that the administration may be planning a December surprise invasion. Can you tell us under what circumstances a reelected Reagan administration would consider the use of force in Central American or the Caribbean? Bush: We don't think we're to be required to use force. Let me point out that there are 2,000 Cuban military and 7,500 so-called Cuban advisers in Nicaragua. There are 55 American military in El Salvador. I went down, on the instructions of the president, to speak to the commandants in El Salvador and told them that they had to move with Mr. Magana, then the president of El Salvador, to respect human rights. They have done that. They're moving well. I'm not saying it's perfect, but the difference between El Salvador and Nicaragua is like the difference between night and day. El Salvador went to the polls, Mr. Duarte was elected by 70 percent of the people in 70 percent voting in a certifiably free election. In Nicaragua, you have something very different. You have a Marxist-Leninist group, the Sandinistas, that came into power talking democracy. They have aborted their democracy. They have humiliated the Holy Father. They have cracked down on the only press organ there, La Prensa, censoring the press something that should concern every American. They have not had any human rights at all. They will not permit free elections. Mr. Cruz, who was to be the only viable challenger to Nicaragua, the Sandinistas, to the junta, to Mr. Ortega, went down there and found that the ground rules were so unfair that he couldn't even wage a campaign. One country is devoid of human rights. The other is struggling to perfect their democracy. We don't like it, frankly, when Nicaragua exports its revolution or serves as a conduit for supplies coming over from such ""democracies"" as North Korea, Bulgaria, the Soviet Union and Cube, to try to destabilize El Salvador. Yes, we're concerned about that. Because we want to see this trend toward democracy continue. There have been something like thirteen countries since we've come in move toward the democratic route, and let me say that Grenada is not unrelated. And I have a big difference with Mrs. Ferraro on that one. We gave those four tiny Caribbean countries a chance. We saved the lives, and most of those thousand students said they were in jeopardy. Grenada was a proud moment because we did stand up for democracy. But in terms of threat of these countries, nuclear, I mean, weapons, no. There's not that kind of a threat. It's Mr. Mondale that proposed the quarantine, not Ronald Reagan. WHITE: Considering this country's long respect for the rule of international law, was it right for the United States to be involved in mining the harbors of Nicaragua, a country we're not at war with, and to subsequently refuse to allow the World Court to adjudicate that dispute and the complaint from Nicaragua? BUSH: I support what we're doing. It was supported to the Congress and under the law. I support it. My only regret is that the aid for the contras, those people that are fighting, we call them freedom fighters. They want to see the democracy perfected in Nicaragua. Am I to understand from this assault on covert action that nowhere in the world would we do something that was considered just off base when Mrs. Ferraro said she's never support it? Would she never support it if the violation of human rights was so great and quiet support was necessary for freedom fighters? Yes, we're for the contras. And let me tell you another fact about the controls. Everyone that's not for this, everyone who wants to let that Sandinista government prevail, just like that Castro did, all of that, the contras are not Somozistas. Less than 5 percent of the contras supported Somoza. These were people that wanted a revolution. These people that felt the revolution was betrayed. These are people that support human rights. Yes, we should support them. VANOCUR: Congresswoman Ferraro. FERRARO: I spent time in Central America in January and had an opportunity to speak to the contras after the incident in Nicaragua and in El Salvador. Let me just say that the situation as it exists now, because of this administration's policies, are not getting better. We're not moving toward a more secure area of the world. As a matter of fact the number of troops that the Sandinistas have accumulated since the administration started its covert activities has risen from 12,000 to 50,000, and of course the number of Soviet and Cuban advisors has also increased. I did not support the mining of the harbors in Nicaragua; it is a violation of international law. Congress did not support it and as a matter of fact, just this week, the Congress voted in cut off covert aid to Nicaragua unless and until a request is made and there is evidence of need for it, and the Congress approves it again in March. So if Congress doesn't get laid on, the covert activities which I opposed in Nicaragua, those CIA covert activities in that specific country, are not supported by the Congress. And believe it or not, not supported by the majority of people throughout the country. VANOCUR: Vice President Bush. BUSH: Well, I would simply like to make the distinction again between those countries that are searching for democracy and the handful of countries that have totally violated human rights and are going the Marxist route. Ortega, the commandante who is head of the Nicaraguan Sandinistas, is an avowed Marxist. They don't believe in the church. They don't believe in free elections. They don't believe in all of the values that we believe in. So it is our policy to support the democracy there, and when you have freedom fighters that want to protect that revolution, and go the democratic route, we believe in giving them support. We are for democracy in the hemisphere. We are for negotiations. $3 out of every $4 that we sent down there has been for economic aid to support the people's chance to eat and live and be happy and enjoy life. And one-fourth only was rnilitary. You wouldn't get that from listening to Mr. Mondale. VANOCUR: Miss Quarles. QUARLES: Vice President Bush, the last three Republican administrations, Eisenhower, Nixon, and Ford, none of them soft on communism, met with the Soviets and got agreements on arms control. The Soviets haven't changed that much. Can you tell us why President Reagan has not met with the Soviet ministers at all and only met with Prime Minister Gromyko less than a month ago? BUSH: Yes, I can. The, you mentioned the Gromyko meeting, those were broken off under the Carter-Mondale days. There had been three separate Soviet leaders. Mr. Brezhnev, Mr. Andropov, and now Chernenko. During their, that, in three and a half years, three separate leaders. The Soviets have not been willing to talk. We are the ones that went to the table in INF. We had a good proposal, a moral proposal. Ban an entire generation of intermediate nuclear force weapons and if you won't do that, don't leave your allies in Europe in a monopoly position. The Soviets with 1,200 of these things, and the alliance with none. We didn't think that's the way to deter aggression and keep the peace. The president went, the first thing he did when he came into office was make a proposal on the most destabilizing weapons of all, START. And when the the strategic weapon and when the Soviets said, well, we don't like that proposal, we said all right, we'll be more flexible. I at the urging of the president went to Geneva and laid on the table a treaty to ban all chemical weapons. We don't want them to have a monopoly. We said look, let's come together. You come over here and see what we're doing; we'll go over there and see what you're doing. But let's save the kids of this world from chemical weapons. A brilliant proposal to get rid of all of them. And the Soviets nyet, nyet nyet. In the mutual balance force reduction to reduce conventional forces, they're not even willing to tell us the base. Mrs. Ferraro knows that, and how many troops they have. There's four sessions. We have had an agreement with them on the hot line. But Carter-Monad made an agreement, the Salt II agreement, but the Democratic Senate, they were a Democratic administration, the Democratic Senate wouldn't even ratify that agreement. It was flawed, it was unverifiable and it was not good. Our president wants to reduce, not just to stop, he wants to reduce dramatically nuclear weapons. And when the Soviets know they're going to have this strong president to deal with, and when this new administration, Mr. Chernenko, given more than a few months in office can solidify its position, then they'll talk. But if they think the opposition, before they sit down, are going to give up the MX, give up the B-l, go for a freeze that locks in inferiority in Europe, all of these things, unilaterally, before they're willing to talk, they may just sweat it out for four more weeks. Who knows. QUARLES: You were once quoted as saying that a nuclear war is winnable. Is that still your belief, and if not, under what circumstances would you use nuclear weapons if you were president? BUSH: No, I don't think it's winnable. I was quoted wrong, obviously, 'cause I never thought that. The Soviet planning, I did learn that when I was director of Central Intelligence, and I don't think there'd be any disagreement, is based on that ugly concept. But I agree with the president: It should never be fought. Nuclear weapons should never be fought with, and that's our approach. So, therefore, let's encourage the Soviets to come to the table as we did at the Gromyko meeting. I wish everybody could have seen that one - the President, giving the facts to Gromyko in all of these nuclear meetings - excellent, right on top of that subject matter. And I'll bet you that Gromyko went back to the Soviet Union saying, ""Hey, listen, this president is calling the shots; we'd better move."" But do you know why I think we'll get an agreement? Because I think it is in the interest of the Soviet Union to make it, just as it is in the United States. They're not deterred by rhetoric. I listened to the rhetoric for two years at the United Nations. I've lived in a Communist country. It's not rhetoric that decides agreements, it's self-interest of those countries. QUARLES: Congresswoman Ferraro, you and Mr. Mondale are for a verifiable nuclear freeze. Some Democrats have said that verification may not be possible. How would you verify such an agreement and make sure that the Soviets are not cheating? FERRARO: Let me say first of all that I don't think there is any issue that is more important in this campaign, in this election, than the issue of war and peace. And since today is Eleanor Roosevelt's 100th birthday, let me quote her. She said, ""It is not enough to want peace, you must believe in it. And it is not enough to believe in it, you must work for it."" This administration's policies have indicated quite the opposite. The last time I heard Vice President Bush blame the fact that they didn't meet with the Soviet leader, and this is the first president in forty years not to meet with a Soviet counterpart. He said the reason was because there are three Soviet leaders in the past three and a half years. I went and got a computer printout. It's five pages of the leaders, world leaders, that the Soviet leaders have met with, and they're not little people. They're people like Mitterrand of France and Kohl of Germany and President Kiprianou of Cyprus - you go down the list, five pages of people that the Soviet leaders have managed to meet with and somehow they couldn't meet with the president of the United States. In addition to not meeting with his Soviet counterpart, this is the first president - and you're right - since the start of negotiating arms control agreements who have not negotiated an arms control agreement, But not only has he not negotiated one, he's been opposed to every single one that every other president has negotiated, including Eisenhower, including Ford, and including Nixon. Now, let me just say that with reference to the vice-president's comments about the intent and the desire of the United Sites and this administration, the Soviet Union did walk out of the talks. I agree. But it seems to me in 1982, when the administration presented its Start proposal, that it wasn't a realistic proposal. And that is the comment that was made by Secretary Haig after he left office, because what it dealt with was that it dealt just with land-based nuclear missiles, which is where the Soviets had the bulk of their missiles. But that aside, in 1982, I believe it was, their own negotiator, Nitze, came out with a proposal called the ""walk-in-the-woods proposal"" which would have limited the number of nuclear arms in Europe. That proposal was turned down by the administration - a proposal presented by its own administrator. Now I'm delighted that they met with Mr. Gromyko, but they could have had that opportunity to meet with him in 1981 when he came to the UN, which he had done with every other president before, and in 1982 as well. I guess my - VANOCUR: Congresswoman, I'm sorry. Speaking of limits, I have to impose a limit on you, Vice President Bush? BUSH: Well, I think there's quite a difference between Mr. Kyprianou in Cyprus and the leader of the free world, Ronald Reagan, in terms of meeting. And the Soviet Union - the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union will meet with a lot of different people. We've been in very close touch with Mr. Mitterrand, Mr. Kohl, and others that have met with the leaders of the Soviet Union. But that's quite different than meeting with the president of the United States. The Soviets say we'll have a meeting when we think there can be progress and yet they left those talks. I'd like to correct my opponent on the walk in the woods. It was the Soviet Union that was unwilling to discuss the walk in the woods. They were the ones that gunned it down first and the record is very, very clear on that. Miss Ferraro mentioned the inflexibility of our position on strategic arms. Yes, we offered first to get rid of all those - we tried to reduce the SS-18's and those weapons. But then we said if that's not good enough, there is flexibility, let's talk about the bombers and planes. So that's a very important point in terms of negotiation. VANOCUR: Congresswoman, he that taketh away has to give back. I robbed you of your rebuttal. Therefore, you will have two minutes to rebut. Forgive me. FERRARO: I - You robbed me of my follow-up, that's what you robbed me, so why don't I let her give me the follow-up. VANOCUR: All right, and then give your rebuttal. QUARLES: Congresswoman Ferraro, most polls show that the American - Americans feel that the Republicans, more than the Democrats are better able to keep the United States out of war. We've had four years of relative peace under President Reagan. How can you convince the American public that the world would be a safer place under Carter-Mondale? [sic] FERRARO: I think first of all, you have to take a look at the current situation. We now have 50,000 nuclear warheads; we are building at the rate of five or six a day between us and we have been doing that since this administration came into office. I think what you can do is look at what they've done and recognize that they're not going to do very much in the future. And so, since they've done nothing, do we continue to build because an arms race doesn't lead to anything, it leads to another arms race and that's that. Vice President Monad has indicated that what he would do, first of all, as soon as he. gets into office, is contact his Soviet counterpart and set up an annual summit meeting. That's number one. I don't think you can start negotiating until you start talking. Secondly, he would issue a challenge, and the challenge would be in the nature of temporary, mutual, verifiable, moratoria to h","elec-deb-60-to-16"
"Conservation_in_Australia","Conservation in Australia is an issue of state and federal policy. Australia is one of the most biologically diverse countries in the world, with a large portion of species endemic to Australia. Preserving this wealth of biodiversity is important for future generations.   Animal habitats like reefs and forests must be preserved in order to preserve population and diversity of animal species. Conservation is vital for future study and for field research to be undertaken, and because biological richness is an unmeasurable aesthetic that may be developed into commercial recreational attractions.   According to Janine Benyus, the potential for advances in biomimicry in Australia are great because the extreme weather and conditions found here provide an excellent evolutionary incubator. Research on natural processes can only occur if habitat is preserved and organisms continue to thrive.  Federal and State governments manage protected areas and national parks; a number of non-governmental organizations are also involved in conservation.  A key conservation issue is the preservation of biodiversity, especially by protecting the remaining rainforests. The destruction of habitat by human activities, including land clearing, remains the major cause of biodiversity loss in Australia. The importance of the Australian rainforests to the conservation movement is very high. Australia is the only western country to have large areas of rainforest intact [REF]. Forests provide timber, drugs, and food and should be managed to maximize the possible uses. Currently, there are a number of environmental movements and campaigners advocating for action on saving the environment, one such campaign is the Big Switch [REF].   Land management issues including clearance of native vegetation, reafforestation of once-cleared areas, control of exotic weeds and pests, expansion of dryland salinity, and changed fire regimes. Intensification of resource use in sectors such as forestry, fisheries, and agriculture are widely reported to contribute to biodiversity loss in Australia. Coastal and marine environments also have reduced biodiversity from reduced water quality caused by pollution and sediments arising from human settlements and agriculture. In central New South Wales where there are large plains of grassland, problems have risen from—unusual to say—lack of land clearing.   Before European settlement, Aborigines burnt the grassland regularly for thousands of years and eventually native animals became dependent on the grasslands and the regular burning. When Europeans settled the area in the early 19th century, their ignorance lead to the destruction of the grassland through lack of regular burning. Thus the grasslands were swallowed up by woody weeds and shrub, degrading the soil, accelerating erosion and reducing the biodiversity.

"Multiculturalism_in_Australia","Multiculturalism in Australia has a special cultural status.   Many similar policies were put in place, for example the formation of the Special Broadcasting Service [REF]. While the White Australia Policy was quietly dismantled after World War II by various changes to immigration policy, the full political introduction of official policies of multiculturalism was not until 1972.  The top ten religions in Australia account for less than 63% of the population [REF].   According to the census more than one fifth of the population were born overseas [REF]. Furthermore, almost 50% of the population were either:  born overseas; or had one or both parents born overseas [REF].   In terms of net migration per capita, Australia is ranked 18th (2008 Data) ahead of Canada, the USA and most of Europe [REF].  The overall level of immigration to Australia has grown during the last decades. Net overseas immigrants increased from 30,000 in 1993[REF] to 118,000 in 2003-04 [REF]. During the 2004-05, total 123,424 people immigrated to Australia.   Of them, 17,736 were from Africa, 54,804 from Asia, 21,131 from Oceania, 18,220 from United Kingdom, 1,506 from South America, and 2,369 from Eastern Europe. 131,000 people migrated to Australia in 2005-06[REF] and migration target for 2006-07 was 144,000 [REF].   In 2008-09 about 300,000 new migrants are expected to arrive in Australia, the highest number since World War II [REF].  The national Capital city, Canberra in the Australian Capital Territory, has developed a tradition of the National Multicultural Festival, held over a week in February [REF]. Additionally, Canberra has numerous other inter-cultural events, such as the Thai Food Festival held at Wat Dhammadharo,[REF] Canberra's Thai temple, on 2009-04-19.  The meaning of multiculturalism has changed significantly since its formal introduction to Australia. Originally it was understood by the mainstream population as a need for acceptance that many members of the Australian community originally came from different cultures and still had ties to it [REF]. However, it came to mean the rights of migrants within mainstream Australia to express their cultural identity. It is now often used to refer to the notion that people in Australia have have multiple cultural or ethnic backgrounds. The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs in Australia estimated that, in 2005, 25% of the Australian workforce was born outside of Australia and 40% had at least one parent born outside of Australia.   Following the initial moves of the Whitlam Labor government in 1973, further official national multicultural policies were implemented by Malcom Fraser's Liberal Government in 1978 [REF]. The Labor Government of Bob Hawke continued with these policies during the 1980s and early 1990s, and were further supported by Paul Keating up to his electoral defeat 1996. CALD (or Culturally and Linguistually Diverse) policies continue to be implemented at all levels of government and public service, such as medical support systems which cater specifically to non-English speaking residents [REF].  Prior to settlement by Europeans, the Australian continent was not a single nation, but hosted many different Aboriginal cultures and between 200 and 400 active languages at any one time. According to the 2006 census some 150 indigenous languages are still spoken. The present nation of Australia resulted from a process of immigration intended to fill the continent (also excluding potential rivals to the British Empire). The continent was regarded as essentially empty. Settlers from the United Kingdom, after 1800 including Ireland, were the earliest people that were not native to the continent to live in Australia. Dutch colonisation (see New Holland) and possible visits to Australia by explorers and/or traders from China, did not lead to permanent settlement. Until 1901, Australia existed as a group of independent British settler colonies.   The Immigration Restriction Act 1901 was the first act of Australian Federal parliament, also known informally as the White Australia policy. This is the term used for the policy of restricted non-European immigration to Australia from 1901 to 1973. Such a policy limited the ethnic and cultural diversity of the immigrant population, and in theory facilitated the cultural assimilation of the immigrants, since they would come from related ethnic and cultural backgrounds.   Taken from a historical perspective, however, this was not a matter of cultural diversity or otherwise, but an attempt to preserve the British ethno-cultural identity of the Australian nation. It was official policy for much of the 20th century to promote European immigration and to keep out those who did not fit the European, predominately Anglo-Celtic, character of Australian society. As the Twentieth century progressed and the number of migrants from the United Kingdom became insufficient to meet planned quotas, immigrants came increasingly from other parts of Europe, such as Italy, Greece, Germany, the Netherlands, and the former Yugoslavia.  The election of John Howard's Liberal-National Coalition government in 1996 was a major watershed for Australian multiculturalism. Howard had long been a critic of multiculturalism, releasing his One Australia policy in the late 1980s which called for a reduction in Asian immigration - a policy he later retracted, citing his then position as wrong. Shortly after the new government took office, the new independent member Pauline Hanson made her maiden speech in which she was highly critical of multiculturalism, saying that a multicultural society could never be strong. Notably, despite many calls for Howard to censure Hanson, his response was to state that her speech indicated a new freedom of expression in Australia on such issues. Rather than official multiculturalism, Howard advocated instead the idea of a ""shared national identity"", albeit one strongly grounded in certain recognisably Anglo-Celtic Australian themes, such as ""mateship"" and a ""fair go"". While Howard changed the name of the Department of Immigration, Multiculturalism and Indigenous Affairs to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, the policy of multiculturalism has remained intact, with the Howard Government introducing expanded dual-citizenship rights at the turn of the Century.   A Practical Reference to Religious Diversity for Operational Police and Emergency Services was a publication of the Australasian Police Multicultural Advisory Bureau designed to offer guidance to police and emergency services personnel on how religious affiliation can affect their contact with the public. The first edition was published in 1999 [REF]. The first edition covered Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic, Jewish and Sikh faiths with participation of representatives of the various religions [REF]. The second edition added Christian, Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander religions and the Bahá'í Faith to the list of religions was published in 2002 [REF].  One of the earliest critics of multiculturalism in Australia was historian Geoffrey Blainey, who wrote that multiculturalism threatened to transform Australia into a ""cluster of tribes"". In his 1984 book All for Australia, Blainey criticized multiculturalism for tending to ""emphasize the rights of ethnic minorities at the expense of the majority of Australians"" and also for tending to be ""anti-British"", even though ""people from the United Kingdom and Ireland form the dominant class of pre-war immigrants and the largest single group of post-war immigrants."" According to Blainey, such a policy, with its ""emphasis on what is different and on the rights of the new minority rather than the old majority,"" was unnecessarily creating division and threatened national cohesion. He argued that ""the evidence is clear that many multicultural societies have failed and that the human cost of the failure has been high"", and warned that ""we should think very carefully about the perils of converting Australia into a giant multicultural laboratory for the assumed benefit of the peoples of the world.""[REF] .   Blainey remained a persistent critic of multiculturalism into the 1990s, denouncing multiculturalism as ""morally, intellectually and economically .. a sham"" "" Historian John Hirst is another intellectual critic of multiculturalism [REF]. He argued that while multiculturalism might serve the needs of ethnic politics and the demands of certain ethnic groups for government money to be used solely for the promotion of their separate ethnic identity, it is a perilous concept on which to found policy [REF]. Hirst identified contradictory statements by political leaders that suggested the word was a nonsense concept. These included the policies of Prime Minister Hawke, a multiculturalist while at the same time promoting a citizenship campaign and stressing the common elements of our culture,[REF] and anti-multiculturalism statements by Prime Minister Howard, who arose the ire of multiculturalists who thought that he was suggesting closing down Italian restaurants and prohibiting the speaking of the Italian language when he proposed no such thing [REF].   Critics associated with the Centre for Population and Urban Research at Monash University have argued that both Right and Left factions in the Australian Labor Party have adopted a multicultural stance for the purposes of increasing their support within the party [REF]. A manifestation of this embrace of multiculturalism has been the creation of ethnic branches within the Labor Party and ethnic branch stacking [REF].   Following the upsurge of support for the One Nation Party in 1996, Lebanese-born Australian anthropologist Ghassan Hage published a critique in 1997 of Australian multiculturalism in the book White Nation [REF]. Drawing on theoretical frameworks from Whiteness studies, Jacques Lacan and Pierre Bourdieu, Hage examined a range of everyday discourses that implicated both anti-multiculturalists and pro-multiculturalists alike.   More recent critics of multiculturalism such as Greg Clancy[REF] argue that multiculturalism has resulted in political corruption, increased corruption and a destroyed social order [REF].","ibm-debater-claim-evidence-acl"
"Maung_Zarni","Maung Zarni is a Burmese democracy activist. He is a research fellow at the London School of Economics. He lived in the United States where he founded in 1995 the Free Burma Coalition, which became one of the largest Burmese democracy group in the United States. The Free Burma Coalition adopted the existing boycott of Pepsi originally started by a group of Canadian activists.  He holds a PhD from the University of Wisconsin–Madison, with a thesis entitled ""Power, Knowledge and Control: The Politics of Education in Burma under Military Rule (1962-88)"" under the supervision of the leading neo-Marxist sociologist of education Michael W. Apple. In addition, he was educated at the University of California at Davis, the University of Washington, the University of Mandalay, and St Peter's Boys School in Mandalay. He is a member of the International Institute for Strategic Affairs. He has also participated in the prestigious Georgetown Leadership Seminar (2004) and has served as a fellow in the Rockefeller Foundation Next Generation Leadership Program (2001–2003).  On April 26, 1996, USA Today published a cover story about the Free Burma Coalition with a front page picture of Zarni. Ralph Nader dubbed the Free Burma Coalition a ""model citizens' activist movement."" .   Free Burma Coalition activists ramped up the pressure on PepsiCo until 1997 when the company completely severed its remaining business ties in Burma. The Free Burma Coalition also campaigned against nearly 100 corporations in Burma, including several oil companies, such as Arco, Unocal, and Texaco.   ==The 2000s  In 2003, Dr. Zarni started to express publicly his deep disillusionment with Aung San Suu Kyi's leadership abilities and her policy of sanctions and boycotts. Zarni and a group of Western-educated Burmese dissidents explored alternatives to what they termed as ""the sanctions and boycott orthodoxy."" They came to the conclusion that economic sanctions and political pressure by Western countries on Burma was counter-productive and futile as long as China, India, Thailand and other Asian countries continued to do business with and provide political support to the ruling regime. Dr. Zarni and his Burmese colleagues renounced their long-standing pro-sanctions and pro-boycott policy in 2003.   During the aftermath of the Burmese junta's bloody ambush against Aung San Suu Kyi and her motorcade during an up country tour in May 2003, Dr. Zarni explored radical measures, including reviving and strengthening armed resistance in the country. According to Dr. Zarni, he was tasked by General Saw Bo Mya, the leader of the Karen National Union and the Chair of the National Council of the Union of Burma based in the Thai-Burmese border, with a secret mission to lead a small team of Burmese dissidents whose mission was to seek support from Western governments for the dissidents' armed resistance. Zarni stated later that the effort failed because of what he described as a leak within the Burmese dissident community.   Six months after the secret mission was folded, General Saw Bo Mya flew to Yangon in January 2004 where he made a highly publicized ceasefire deal with the Head of the Burmese Military Intelligence and negotiator General Khin Nyunt.   Meanwhile, Dr. Zarni and came into contact with what he described as the moderate elements within the military's inner circle. He launched a diplomacy initiative with a 100-page report ""Common Problems, Shared Responsibilities: A Burmese Citizens' Initiative for National Reconciliation."" .   Following Zarni's change in policy, the staff and virtually all the group's supporters and funders left the Free Burma Coalition and founded the U.S. Campaign for Burma, which maintains the Free Burma Coalition's original mission and policies. The Free Burma Coalition is now largely moribund.   In March 2004, Dr. Zarni made a confidential one-day trip to Yangon to meet with deputies of the Prime Minister Khin Nyunt, including Brigadier General Than Tun, government spokesperson Colonel Hla Min, and Colonel Tin Oo. Zarni sought discussions on how to create political space and build confidence between moderate military officers and moderate dissidents in exile. However, Prime Minister Khin Nyunt and the entire moderate camp was later purged by military regime hardliners deeply opposed to Aung San Suu Kyi and the Burmese democracy movement.   Zarni renounced his political asylum in the United States and returned to Burma in October 2005 with the hope of building ties with members the ruling military regime to help open up the country. He described his position as one of ""principled and strategic engagement"" with the Burmese military junta.   Dr. Zarni's critique of Aung San Suu Kyi's policies has earned him notoriety. Most Burmese exiles and the democracy movement activists inside Burma maintain that economic sanctions and political pressure on the Burmese military regime remain the only feasible policy to achieve a restoration of democracy and human rights in Burma. Many have questioned Zarni's motives and his change of position to one of engaging the Burmese military junta. In 2006, Zarni was amongst the members of the military junta and junta supporters who were listed as ""enemies of the democracy movement"" in a publication circulated inside Burma. In an interview in June 2006 with the Independent, Zarni stated that American efforts to sanction Burma were useless because Burma's neighbors, especially China, would never agree to them [REF].   Despite this criticism, Dr. Zarni continues to espouse his views within academic and policy circles. He has been sometimes quoted in and has written for the international print and broadcast media. In one interview with Burmese magazine (Irrawaddy) in 2009, Zarni confessed that he no longer believes that negotiating with the military junta for the restoration of democracy in Burma will be successful based on unfruitful experience with military officials in recent years. He advised people to be more cautious and aware of military junta's attitude and nature.   Dr. Zarni now resides in Great Britain where he is a Visiting Research Fellow (2006–2009) at the Department of International Development at Queen Elizabeth House with the University of Oxford.","ibm-debater-claim-evidence-acl"
"Copyright","Copyright is a legal concept, enacted by most governments, giving the creator of an original work exclusive rights to it, usually for a limited time. Generally, it is ""the right to copy"", but also gives the copyright holder the right to be credited for the work, to determine who may adapt the work to other forms, who may perform the work, who may financially benefit from it, and other related rights. It is an intellectual property form (like the patent, the trademark, and the trade secret) applicable to any expressible form of an idea or information that is substantive and discrete.[REF] .   Copyright initially was conceived as a way for government to restrict printing; the contemporary intent of copyright is to promote the creation of new works by giving authors control of and profit from them. Copyrights are said to be territorial, which means that they do not extend beyond the territory of a specific state unless that state is a party to an international agreement. Today, however, this is less relevant since most countries are parties to at least one such agreement. While many aspects of national copyright laws have been standardized through international copyright agreements, copyright laws of most countries have some unique features [REF]. Typically, the duration of copyright is the whole life of the creator plus fifty to a hundred years from the creator's death, or a finite period for anonymous or corporate creations. Some jurisdictions have required formalities to establishing copyright, but most recognize copyright in any completed work, without formal registration. Generally, copyright is enforced as a civil matter, though some jurisdictions do apply criminal sanctions.   Most jurisdictions recognize copyright limitations, allowing ""fair"" exceptions to the creator's exclusivity of copyright, and giving users certain rights. The development of digital media and computer network technologies have prompted reinterpretation of these exceptions, introduced new difficulties in enforcing copyright, and inspired additional challenges to copyright law's philosophic basis. Simultaneously, businesses with great economic dependence upon copyright have advocated the extension and expansion of their copy rights, and sought additional legal and technological enforcement.  Some take the approach of looking for coherent justifications of established copyright systems, while others start with general ethical theories, such as utilitarianism and try to analyse policy through that lens. Another approach denies the meaningfulness of any ethical justification for existing copyright law, viewing it simply as a result (and perhaps an undesirable result) of political processes.   Another widely debated issue is the relationship between copyrights and other forms of ""intellectual property"", and material property. Most scholars of copyright agree that it can be called a kind of property, because it involves the exclusion of others from something. But there is disagreement about the extent to which that fact should allow the transportation of other beliefs and intuitions about material possessions.   There are many other philosophical questions which arise in the jurisprudence of copyright. They include such problems as determining when one work is ""derived"" from another, or deciding when information has been placed in a ""tangible"" or ""material"" form.   Some critics claim copyright law protects corporate interests while criminalizing legitimate use, while proponents argue the law is fair and just [REF].  Copyright was invented after the advent of the printing press and with wider public literacy. As a legal concept, its origins in Britain were from a reaction to printers' monopolies at the beginning of the eighteenth century. Charles II of England was concerned by the unregulated copying of books and passed the Licensing of the Press Act 1662 by Act of Parliament,[REF] which established a register of licensed books and required a copy to be deposited with the Stationers' Company, essentially continuing the licensing of material that had long been in effect.   The British Statute of Anne (1709) further alluded to individual rights of the artist, beginning: ""Whereas Printers, Booksellers, and other Persons, have of late frequently taken the Liberty of Printing.. Books, and other Writings, without the Consent of the Authors.. to their very great Detriment, and too often to the Ruin of them and their Families:..""[REF] A right to benefit financially from the work is articulated, and court rulings and legislation have recognized a right to control the work, such as ensuring that the integrity of it is preserved. An irrevocable right to be recognized as the work's creator appears in some countries' copyright laws.   Aside from the role of governments and the church, the history of copyright law is in essential ways also connected to the rise of capitalism and the attendant extension of commodity relations to the realm of creative human activities, such as literary and artistic production. Similarly, different cultural attitudes, social organizations, economic models and legal frameworks are seen to account for why copyright emerged in Europe and not, for example, in Asia. In the Middle Ages in Europe, there was generally a lack of any concept of literary property due to the general relations of production, the specific organization of literary production and the role of culture in society. The latter refers to the tendency of oral societies, such as that of Europe in the medieval period, to view knowledge as the product, expression and property of the collective. Not until capitalism emerges in Europe with its individualist ideological underpinnings does the conception of intellectual property and by extension copyright law emerge. Intellectual production comes to be seen as a product of an individual and their property, rather than a collective or social product which belongs in the commons. The most significant point is that under the capitalist mode of production, patent and copyright laws support in fundamental and thoroughgoing ways the expansion of the range of creative human activities that can be commodified. This parallels the ways in which capitalism led to the commodification of many aspects of social life that hitherto had no monetary or economic value per se [REF].   The Statute of Anne was the first real copyright act, and gave the publishers rights for a fixed period, after which the copyright expired [REF]. Copyright has grown from a legal concept regulating copying rights in the publishing of books and maps to one with a significant effect on nearly every modern industry, covering such items as sound recordings, films, photographs, software, and architectural works.   Prior to the passage of the United States Constitution, several States passed their own various copyright laws between 1783 and 1787, the first State having done so being Connecticut [REF]. Contemporary scholars and patriots such as Noah Webster, John Trumbull, and Joel Barlow were instrumental in securing the passage of these statutes [REF]. The Copyright Clause of the United States Constitution (1787) authorized copyright legislation: ""To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries."" That is, by guaranteeing them a period of time in which they alone could profit from their works, they would be enabled and encouraged to invest the time required to create them, and this would be good for society as a whole. A right to profit from the work has been the philosophical underpinning for much legislation extending the duration of copyright, to the life of the creator and beyond, to his heirs.   The original length of copyright in the US was 14 years, and it had to be explicitly applied for. If the author wished, he could apply for a second 14 year monopoly grant, but after that the work entered the public domain, so it could be used and built upon by others.   Thomas Jefferson, who strongly advocated the ability of the public to share and build upon the works of others, proposed as part of the Bill of Rights that a short timespan be protected: .   Art. 9. Monopolies may be allowed to persons for their own productions in literature and their own inventions in the arts for a term not exceeding — years but for no longer term and no other purpose [REF].   The 1886 Berne Convention first established recognition of copyrights among sovereign nations, rather than merely bilaterally. Under the Berne Convention, copyrights for creative works do not have to be asserted or declared, as they are automatically in force at creation: an author need not ""register"" or ""apply for"" a copyright in countries adhering to the Berne Convention [REF]. As soon as a work is ""fixed"", that is, written or recorded on some physical medium, its author is automatically entitled to all copyrights in the work, and to any derivative works unless and until the author explicitly disclaims them, or until the copyright expires. The Berne Convention also resulted in foreign authors being treated equivalently to domestic authors, in any country signed onto the Convention. The UK signed the Berne Convention in 1887 but did not implement large parts of it until 100 years later with the passage of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act of 1988. The USA did not sign the Berne Convention until 1989 [REF].   The United States and most Latin American countries instead entered into the Buenos Aires Convention in 1910, which required a copyright notice (such as ""all rights reserved"") on the work, and permitted signatory nations to limit the duration of copyrights to shorter and renewable terms [REF]. The Universal Copyright Convention was drafted in 1952 as another less demanding alternative to the Berne Convention, and ratified by nations such as the Soviet Union and developing nations.   The regulations of the Berne Convention are incorporated into the World Trade Organization's TRIPS agreement (1995), thus giving the Berne Convention effectively near-global application [REF]. The 2002 WIPO Copyright Treaty enacted greater restrictions on the use of technology to copy works in the nations that ratified it.   With the intense lobbying of Disney, each time its works came close to entering into the public domain under normal conditions, the US Congress has extended copyright length, until it's gone from the original 14 years, after which the work would become available to the public to build upon, to 70 years after the death of the author.  Copyright may apply to a wide range of creative, intellectual, or artistic forms, or ""works"". Specifics vary by jurisdiction, but these can include poems, theses, plays, other literary works, movies, dances, musical compositions, audio recordings, paintings, drawings, sculptures, photographs, software, radio and television broadcasts, and industrial designs. Graphic designs and industrial designs may have separate or overlapping laws applied to them in some jurisdictions [REF].   Copyright does not cover ideas and information themselves, only the form or manner in which they are expressed [REF]. For example, the copyright to a Mickey Mouse cartoon restricts others from making copies of the cartoon or creating derivative works based on Disney's particular anthropomorphic mouse, but does not prohibit the creation of other works about anthropomorphic mice in general, so long as they are different enough to not be judged copies of Disney's [REF]. In many jurisdictions, copyright law makes exceptions to these restrictions when the work is copied for the purpose of commentary or other related uses (See Fair Use, Fair Dealing). Meanwhile, other laws may impose additional restrictions that copyright does not — such as trademarks and patents.   Copyright laws are standardized somewhat through international conventions such as the Berne Convention and Universal Copyright Convention. These multilateral treaties have been ratified by nearly all countries, and international organizations such as the European Union or World Trade Organization require their member states to comply with them.  Typically, a work must meet minimal standards of originality in order to qualify for copyright, and the copyright expires after a set period of time (some jurisdictions may allow this to be extended). Different countries impose different tests, although generally the requirements are low; in the United Kingdom there has to be some 'skill, labour and judgment' that has gone into it [REF]. In Australia and the United Kingdom it has been held that a single word is insufficient to comprise a copyright work. However, single words or a short string of words can sometimes be registered as a trademark instead.   Copyright law recognises the right of an author based on whether the work actually is an original creation, rather than based on whether it is unique; two authors may own copyright on two substantially identical works, if it is determined that the duplication was coincidental, and neither was copied from the other.   In all countries where the Berne Convention standards apply, copyright is automatic, and need not be obtained through official registration with any government office. Once an idea has been reduced to tangible form, for example by securing it in a fixed medium (such as a drawing, sheet music, photograph, a videotape, or a computer file), the copyright holder is entitled to enforce his or her exclusive rights [REF]. However, while registration isn't needed to exercise copyright, in jurisdictions where the laws provide for registration, it serves as prima facie evidence of a valid copyright and enables the copyright holder to seek statutory damages and attorney's fees. (In the USA, registering after an infringement only enables one to receive actual damages and lost profits.) .   The original holder of the copyright may be the employer of the author rather than the author himself, if the work is a ""work for hire"" [REF]. For example, in English law the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 provides that if a copyrighted work is made by an employee in the course of that employment, the copyright is automatically owned by the employer which would be a ""Work for Hire."" .   Copyrights are generally enforced by the holder in a civil law court, but there are also criminal infringement statutes in some jurisdictions. While central registries are kept in some countries which aid in proving claims of ownership, registering does not necessarily prove ownership, nor does the fact of copying (even without permission) necessarily prove that copyright was infringed. Criminal sanctions are generally aimed at serious counterfeiting activity, but are now becoming more commonplace as copyright collectives such as the RIAA are increasingly targeting the file sharing home Internet user. Thus far, however, most such cases against file sharers have been settled out of court. (See: File sharing and the law) .  In most jurisdictions the copyright holder must bear the cost of enforcing copyright. This will usually involve engaging legal representation, administrative and or court costs. These costs, including time, should be taken into consideration when evaluating the benefits of enforcing copyright. In light of this many copyright disputes are settled by a direct approach to the infringing party in order to settle the dispute out of court.  Prior to 1989, use of a copyright notice — consisting of the copyright symbol (, the letter C inside a circle), the abbreviation ""Copr."", or the word ""Copyright"", followed by the year of the first publication of the work and the name of the copyright holder — was part of United States statutory requirements [REF]. Several years may be noted if the work has gone through substantial revisions. The proper copyright notice for sound recordings of musical or other audio works is a sound recording copyright symbol (, the letter P inside a circle), which indicates a sound recording copyright, with the letter ""p"" indicating a ""phonorecord."" Similarly, the phrase All rights reserved was once required to assert copyright.   In 1989, the U.S. enacted the Berne Convention Implementation Act, amending the 1976 Copyright Act to conform to most of the provisions of the Berne Convention. As a result, the use of copyright notices has become optional to claim copyright, because the Berne Convention makes copyright automatic [REF]. However, the lack of notice of copyright using these marks may have consequences in terms of reduced damages in an infringement lawsuit — using notices of this form may reduce the likelihood of a defense of ""innocent infringement"" being successful [REF].  A widely circulated strategy to avoid the cost of copyright registration is referred to as the ""poor man's copyright"". It proposes that the creator send the work to himself in a sealed envelope by registered mail, using the postmark to establish the date. This technique has not been recognized in any published opinions of the United States courts. The United States Copyright Office makes it clear that the technique is no substitute for actual registration [REF]. The United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office discusses the technique but does not recommend its use [REF].  Several exclusive rights typically attach to the holder of a copyright: .   to produce copies or reproductions of the work and to sell those copies (including, typically, electronic copies) to import or export the work  to create derivative works (works that adapt the original work) to perform or display the work publicly  to sell or assign these rights to others  to transmit or display by radio or video[REF] .   The phrase ""exclusive right"" means that only the copyright holder is free to exercise those rights, and others are prohibited from using the work without the holders permission. Copyright is sometimes called a ""negative right"", as it serves to prohibit certain people (e.g., readers, viewers, or listeners, and primarily publishers and would be publishers) from doing something they would otherwise be able to do, rather than permitting people (e.g., authors) to do something they would otherwise be unable to do. In this way it is similar to the unregistered design right in English law and European law. The rights of the copyright holder also permit him/her to not use or exploit their copyright, for some or all of the term. There is, however, a critique which rejects this assertion as being based on a philosophical interpretation of copyright law that is not universally shared. There is also debate on whether copyright should be considered a property right or a moral right.  If a pictorial, graphic or sculptural work is a useful article, it is copyrighted only if its aesthetic features are separable from its utilitarian features. A useful article is an article having an intrinsic utilitarian function that is not merely to portray the appearance of the article or to convey information. They must be separable from the functional aspect to be copyrighted [REF].  The idea-expression divide differentiates between ideas and expression, and states that copyright protects only the original expression of ideas, and not the ideas themselves. This principle, first clarified in the 1879 case of Baker v. Selden, has since been codified by the Copyright Act of 1976 at 17 U.S.C. § 102(b).  Copyright law does not restrict the owner of a copy from reselling legitimately obtained copies of copyrighted works, provided that those copies were originally produced by or with the permission of the copyright holder. It is therefore legal, for example, to resell a copyrighted book or CD. In the United States this is known as the first-sale doctrine, and was established by the courts to clarify the legality of reselling books in second-hand bookstores. Some countries may have parallel importation restrictions that allow the copyright holder to control the aftermarket. This may mean for example that a copy of a book that does not infringe copyright in the country where it was printed does infringe copyright in a country into which it is imported for retailing. The first-sale doctrine is known as exhaustion of rights in other countries and is a principle which also applies, though somewhat differently, to patent and trademark rights. It is important to note that the first-sale doctrine permits the transfer of the particular legitimate copy involved. It does not permit making or distributing additional copies.   In addition, copyright, in most cases, does not prohibit one from acts such as modifying, defacing, or destroying his or her own legitimately obtained copy of a copyrighted work, so long as duplication is not involved. However, in countries that implement moral rights, a copyright holder can in some cases successfully prevent the mutilation or destruction of a work that is publicly visible.  Copyright does not prohibit all copying or replication. In the United States, the fair use doctrine, codified by the Copyright Act of 1976 as 17 U.S.C. Section 107, permits some copying and distribution without permission of the copyright holder or payment to same. The statute does not clearly define fair use, but instead gives four non-exclusive factors to consider in a fair use analysis. Those factors are: .   the purpose and character of your use  the nature of the copyrighted work  what amount and proportion of the whole work was taken, and  the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work [REF].   In the United Kingdom and many other Commonwealth countries, a similar notion of fair dealing was established by the courts or through legislation. The concept is sometimes not well defined; however in Canada, private copying for personal use has been expressly permitted by statute since 1999. In Australia, the fair dealing exceptions under the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) are a limited set of circumstances under which copyrighted material can be legally copied or adapted without the copyright holder's consent. Fair dealing uses are research and study; review and critique; news reportage and the giving of professional advice (i.e. legal advice). Under current Australian law it is still a breach of copyright to copy, reproduce or adapt copyright material for personal or private use without permission from the copyright owner. Other technical exemptions from infringement may also apply, such as the temporary reproduction of a work in machine readable form for a computer.   In the United States the AHRA (Audio Home Recording Act Codified in Section 10, 1992) prohibits action against consumers making noncommercial recordings of music, in return for royalties on both media and devices plus mandatory copy-control mechanisms on recorders.   Section 1008. Prohibition on certain infringement actions .   No action may be brought under this title alleging infringement of copyright based on the manufacture, importation, or distribution of a digital audio recording device, a digital audio recording medium, an analog recording device, or an analog recording medium, or based on the noncommercial use by a consumer of such a device or medium for making digital musical recordings or analog musical recordings.[REF] .   Later acts amended US Copyright law so that for certain purposes making 10 copies or more is construed to be commercial, but there is no general rule permitting such copying. Indeed making one complete copy of a work, or in many cases using a portion of it, for commercial purposes will not be considered fair use. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act prohibits the manufacture, importation, or distribution of devices whose intended use, or only significant commercial use, is to bypass an access or copy control put in place by a copyright owner [REF]. An appellate court has held that fair use is not a defense to engaging in such distribution.  It is legal in several countries including the United Kingdom and the United States to produce alternative versions (for example, in large print or braille) of a copyrighted work to provide improved access to a work for blind and visually impaired persons without permission from the copyright holder [REF].  A copyright, or aspects of it, may be assigned or transferred from one party to another [REF]. For example, a musician who records an album will often sign an agreement with a record company in which the musician agrees to transfer all copyright in the recordings in exchange for royalties and other considerations. The creator (and original copyright holder) benefits, or expects to, from production and marketing capabilities far beyond those of the author. In the digital age of music, music may be copied and distributed at minimal cost through the Internet, however the record industry attempts to provide promotion and marketing for the artist and his or her work so it can reach a much larger audience. A copyright holder need not transfer all rights completely, though many publishers will insist. Some of the rights may be transferred, or else the copyright holder may grant another party a non-exclusive license to copy and/or distribute the work in a particular region or for a specified period of time.   A transfer or licence may have to meet particular formal requirements in order to be effective,[REF] for example under the Australian Copyright Act 1968 the copyright itself must be expressly transferred in writing. Under the U.S. Copyright Act, a transfer of ownership in copyright must be memorialized in a writing signed by the transferor. For that purpose, ownership in copyright includes exclusive licenses of rights. Thus exclusive licenses, to be effective, must be granted in a written instrument signed by the grantor. No special form of transfer or grant is required. A simple document that identifies the work involved and the rights being granted is sufficient. Non-exclusive grants (often called non-exclusive licenses) need not be in writing under U.S. law. They can be oral or even implied by the behavior of the parties. Transfers of copyright ownership, including exclusive licenses, may and should be recorded in the U.S. Copyright Office. (Information on recording transfers is available on the Office's web site.) While recording is not required to make the grant effective, it offers important benefits, much like those obtained by recording a deed in a real estate transaction.   Copyright may also be licensed [REF]. Some jurisdictions may provide that certain classes of copyrighted works be made available under a prescribed statutory license (e.g. musical works in the United States used for radio broadcast or performance). This is also called a compulsory license, because under this scheme, anyone who wishes to copy a covered work does not need the permission of the copyright holder, but instead merely files the proper notice and pays a set fee established by statute (or by an agency decision under statutory guidance) for every copy made [REF]. Failure to follow the proper procedures would place the copier at risk of an infringement suit. Because of the difficulty of following every individual work, copyright collectives or collecting societies and performing rights organizations (such as ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC have been formed to collect royalties for hundreds (thousands and more) works at once. Though this market solution bypasses the statutory license, the availability of the statutory fee still helps dictate the price per work collective rights organizations charge, driving it down to what avoidance of procedural hassle would justify.  Founded in 2001, Creative Commons (CC) is a non-profit organization[REF] which aims to facilitate the legal sharing of creative works. To this end the organization provides a number of copyright license options to the public, free of charge. These licenses allow copyright holders to define conditions under which others may use a work and to specify what types of use are acceptable [REF]. Terms of use have traditionally been negotiated on an individual basis between copyright holder and potential licensee. Therefore, a general CC license outlining which rights the copyright holder is willing to waive enable the general public to use such works more freely. Four general types of CC licenses are available. These are based upon copyright holder stipulations such as whether he or she is willing to allow modifications to the work, whether he or she permits the creation of derivative works and whether he or she is willing to permit commercial use of the work [REF]. Individuals may register for a CC license via the [REF]. As of 2009 approximately 130 million individuals had received such licenses [REF].  Copyright subsists for a variety of lengths in different jurisdictions. The length of the term can depend on several factors, including the type of work (e.g. musical composition, novel), whether the work has been published, and whether the work was created by an individual or a corporation. In most of the world, the default length of copyright is the life of the author plus either 50 or 70 years. In the United States, the term for most existing works is a fixed number of years after the date of creation or publication. Under most countries' laws (for example, the United States[REF] and the United Kingdom[REF]), copyrights expire at the end of the calendar year in question.   The length and requirements for copyright duration are subject to change by legislation, and since the early 20th century there have been a number of adjustments made in various countries, which can make determining the duration of a given copyright somewhat difficult. For example, the United States used to require copyrights to be renewed after 28 years to stay in force, and formerly required a copyright notice upon first publication to gain coverage. In Italy and France, there were post-wartime extensions that could increase the term by approximately 6 years in Italy and up to about 14 in France. Many countries have extended the length of their copyright terms (sometimes retroactively). International treaties establish minimum terms for copyrights, but individual countries may enforce longer terms than those [REF].   In the United States, all books and other works published before 1923 have expired copyrights and are in the public domain [REF]. In addition, works published before 1964 that did not have their copyrights renewed 28 years after first publication year also are in the public domain, except that books originally published outside the US by non-Americans are exempt from this requirement, if they are still under copyright in their home country (see [REF] for more details).   But if the intended exploitation of the work includes publication (or distribution of derivative work, such as a film based on a book protected by copyright) outside the U.S., the terms of copyright around the world must be considered. If the author has been dead more than 70 years, the work is in the public domain in most, but not all, countries. Some works are covered by copyright in Spain for 80 years after the author's death [REF].   In 1998 the length of a copyright in the United States was increased by 20 years under the The Copyright Term Extension Act. This legislation was strongly promoted by corporations which had valuable copyrights which otherwise would have expired, and has been the subject of substantial criticism on this point [REF].   As a curiosity, the famous work Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up has a complex&nbsp;– and disputed&nbsp;– story of copyright expiry [REF].  Copyright, like other intellectual property rights is subject to a statutorily-determined term. Once the term of a copyright has expired, the formerly copyrighted work enters the public domain and may be freely used or exploited by anyone. Courts in the United States and the United Kingdom have rejected the doctrine of a common law copyright. Public domain works should not be confused with works that are publicly available. Works posted in the internet for example, are publicly available, but are not generally in the public domain. Copying such works may therefore violate the author's copyright.  Piracy is considered to be the illegitimate use of materials held by copyright [REF]. For the history of the term ""piracy"" see Copyright infringement. For a work to be considered pirated, its illegitimate use must have occurred in a nation that has domestic copyright laws and/or adheres to a bilateral treaty or established international convention such as the Berne Convention or WIPO Copyright Treaty. Improper use of materials outside of this legislation is deemed ""unauthorized edition"", not piracy [REF].   Piracy primarily targets software, film and music. However, the illegal copying of books and other text works remains common, especially for educational reasons. Statistics regarding the effects of piracy are difficult to determine. Studies have attempted to estimate a monetary loss for industries affected by piracy by predicting what portion of pirated works would have been formally purchased if they had not been freely available [REF]. Estimates in 2007 stated 18.2 billion potential losses in consumer dollars lost as a result of piracy activities in the United States [REF]. International estimates suggest losses in the billions throughout the last decade [REF]. However other reports indicate that piracy does not have an adverse effect on the entertainment industry [REF].","ibm-debater-claim-evidence-acl"

"NOUO1033","Norway, as many other countries have what we call a system of military service. That means that a number of the population have to spend a certain amount of their time learning to defend the country, or maybe even fight a war. I believe everybody has an obligation to defend ones country. It is the duty of everybody when enemies attack your country. By military service is about much that that. It is also about being part of an invasion of another country, about killing human beings - maybe even civilians for a cause you might not agree with. It is about helping destroy another country and setting in back politically and economic for maybe decades. It might even be about destroying your own land and killing your own people if you are in a civil war. I feel that no person should be forced to aim a gun at another person, just because your nation says you have to be part of a military service. And I think it is wrong that a government can force anybody to spend time defending or fighting for something they might not believe in. I believe that if an army consists of entirely professional soldiers we will have a much better defense. Professional soldiers are soldiers by choice, and you will therefore have an army consisting of people who are committed to their job. A country with compulsory military service can end up having an army, which is not the best one to defend the country in a time of emergency because they are not committed by choice. There is also the issue of cost effect. Upholding an army cost a lot of money. A Professional Army might me more cost effective because they might be able to have fewer soldiers doing the same job compared to a compulsory military system. I believe that economists will agree that people who are more committed to the job and even like their job, can get the work done faster that others who merely are there because they have to One of the problems with professional armies is that many countries are too small. I don't think a small country like Norway can get enough people to enlist voluntarily for the army. We have to have compulsory military service in order to get enough people to fill up the positions. A possible solution to this problem is to set the defense of the country out to others. Iceland is a good example on that. The country does not have an army of their own, but rely on USA and NATO to defend them in a time of emergency. I don't believe in a system of military system. Mainly because I don't think people should be forced to kill one another, but also because of the other things I have explained here. Still, I don't see how a small country like Norway can do it any other way. The army we have today is too small to defend Norway alone, but at least we have something to rely on until we get help from the other allied nations. Maybe it is important for the people to have an army to believe in even if it is not as effective as they might think.","utdallas-icle-essay-scoring"
"FRUC3068","Forty years ago the famous French writer Simone de Beauvoir declared that ""The free woman is just being born"". When I hear that statement I immediately think of the feminist movements that have worked during the sixties and the seventies and that have repercussions now in the nineties. That is true that women had not many rights at the beginning of the century and that we needed an evolution, but I think that feminists have gone too far and have done more harm than good. It is clear that today a woman's place is not only at home, that she has the right to have a job too. But I am not sure that now she is really free: free to do what she wants, free to go where she wants, free to be who she wants. She is perhaps even more a slave than before. She works, yes, but she is still the housewife in many households. How can these women reconcile professional life and sentimental or family life? These ""liberated women"" are often working from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and then they have to go back home, do the housework and nurse their children and husband. Even if their husbands can help them, these ""superwomen"" are often very tired and unfortunately very nervous at home and at work, and if they make the big mistake of complaining about it, men reply that they are the ones who wanted equality. Moreover I think that this equality is a source of divorce. A few years ago people thought twice before asking for a divorce, but now that women are financially independent they do not need their husband to support them anymore. Of course in some cases it may be a good thing but often, instead of trying to solve the problems, couples ask for a divorce without thinking of the consequences for the children. The problem is in fact that many feminists confused equality and equivalence. A man is not a woman and a woman is not a man and that is not pejorative for the woman. Feminists say: ""there is nothing (no work) that a woman cannot do!"". Perhaps, but even if women are able to do any work they want, that is not always flattering for them to do these works. Can a woman be feminine, can she still be a woman if she works as a fire- fighter or as a truck-driver? In some cases there is really a loss of femininity, of identity. Another good reason for which I do not really believe in the benefits of feminism is that it makes men laugh. How do you think that a man react when he hears that a woman is shocked when she receives a letter beginning with ""Dear Sirs""? Of course, he finds it ridiculous that some women spend time fighting for such trivial matters. It is in fact unfortunate that feminists have made of woman's liberation a war against men. Man should rather be woman's ally and not her enemy. Of course, I think that women must try to find their place in the society, but not at all costs. They must do it without too much noise and with all their femininity.","utdallas-icle-essay-scoring"

"globalization","And I'd like to begin the evening by introducing the chairman of Intelligence Squared U.S., Mr. Robert Rosenkranz.Well, thank you very much, and it's my pleasure to welcome all of you. My role in these proceedings is to frame the debate. So it's time to clip America's global wings. The U.S. government is in the worst financial shape it has ever been during our lifetimes. China is now the world's second largest economy, and America's largest creditor. With minimal U.S. involvement, popular movements in Egypt and Tunisia have succeeded in toppling autocratic regimes, largely through peaceful means. And where the U.S. has been involved, as in Iraq and Afghanistan, it has sometimes compromised its moral authority-- I'm thinking of Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo, abusive interrogations and civilian casualties--and has often made us more enemies than friends. All these developments suggest that America's hyperactive engagements around the world are financially unsustainable, morally questionable and of dubious value in the hard currency of national self-interest. On the other hand, perhaps developments in the Middle East do reflect well on America's long-standing support for liberty and freedom. They certainly reflect well on such American innovations as Twitter and Facebook. When a tyrant like Gaddafi threatens mayhem, and the U.N. Security Council and the Arab League agree that military action is required, a miracle, by the way, their views are meaningless without U.S. power to back it up. When Iran is trying its best to achieve a nuclear weapons capability, the U.N. can fret. But only the U.S. can lead a serious effort to prevent them from succeeding. Perhaps we're not loved. The rich and the powerful rarely are. But our unflagging efforts are vital to keep the world moving toward greater freedom and greater stability. Well, these differing views about America's role in the world are among the most profound political fault lines that we face. The outstanding panelists we've brought together this evening will help you decide which is the better view. And it's now my privilege to turn the evening over to our moderator John Donvan. John, thank you.Thank you. And I would really like to invite one more round of applause for Robert Rosenkranz because he's the one who makes these debates possible. True or false, it's time to clip America's wings, its global super power wings. Let's have it out. This is a debate from Intelligence Squared U.S. We're at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University. I'm John Donvan of ABC News, and this is another debate from Intelligence Squared U.S. Joining me on the stage, two teams of two members each who will be arguing out this motion. We have, arguing for the motion, Peter Galbraith and Lawrence Korb; against the motion, Eliot Cohen and Elliott Abrams. And I'll point out that throughout the week, the producer of our debate, Dana who has enjoyed describing this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate as having one team that we should call “Elliot Squared.” But-- but we won't. I want to remind you, this is a debate. It's a contest. It's a contest of ideas and logic and argumentation. And you, our audience, will be the judges of this contest. By the time the debate has ended, you will have been asked to vote twice, once before the debate and once again afterwards on our motion, “It's time to clip America's global wings.” And the team that has changed the most minds by the end of the debate will be declared our winner. So let's register your first position, you and members of our audience on this debate. If you go to the keypad to the right of your seat, our motion is, “It's time to clip America's global wings.” If you agree with the motion, push number one. If you disagree, push number two. If you are undecided at this point, push number three. You can ignore the other keys. And if you feel that you entered a key in error, just correct it and the system will lock in your last vote. All right. It looks like everybody got it. Our motion, “It's time to clip America's global wings.” And on to round one. Round one, we have opening statements by each debater in turn. They are seven minutes each. And our first debater up to speak for this motion, Peter Galbraith. He's a former U.S. diplomat. He served as a special deputy representative of the U.N. in Afghanistan. He was the first U.S. ambassador to Croatia. He is currently a Vermont state senator. His entire life has been involved in diplomacy, including a stint as a cabinet member of the transitional government of East Timor, which comes, Peter, with what sorts of perks, passport, what?Use of the VIP lounge in Dili International Airport. But I will say it is a culmination of a career that began with a foreign relations committee ambassador to Croatia, of ever more important jobs in ever smaller places.Ladies and gentlemen, Peter Galbraith.It is time to clip America's global wings. America's global ambitions, particularly in the last decade, have far exceeded our capabilities. It is more than we can afford, more than a trillion dollars on two wars in Afghanistan and in Iraq. But beyond the fact that we can't afford it-- and my colleague, Larry Korb, will make that case, it is that we are not capable of doing it. We do not need to sit here and debate the rights and wrongs, the moral correctness or the lack of correctness of the Iraq war or the Afghanistan war. The fact is we undertook massive nation building exercises, and we did not succeed. In fact, I will argue to you that we have not only not helped the United States, we have undermined America’s national security. Now I want to be clear. Larry Korb and I are not isolationists, we are not against U.S.-- use of U.S. power in the world. When I served as the first U.S. ambassador to Croatia, I argued strongly for U.S. airstrikes against the Serbs who were attacking Sarajevo and civilians in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and when those airstrikes took place, they combined with intense diplomacy, they brought a four-year war that had claimed more than 100,000 lives to an end. It was effective. Larry Korb and I support the intervention in Libya, and it is-- for the same reason that it is working in Bosnia-- it was in Bosnia and in Libya we had limited ambitions. In Bosnia it was to end the war, in Libya to protect civilians. We had allies in Bosnia, the Europeans picked up more than two-thirds of the cost of reconstruction. They’re doing much of the heavy lifting in Libya, and we had partners on the ground. That is not the case in Iraq or in Afghanistan. In the case of Iraq, we went in not appreciating the complexities of the government, and in the end, who ended up as the victor? Iran. For eight years, the Ayatollah Khomeini and the clerical government in Iran fought the Iran-Iraq War, at a cost of a half a million Iranian soldiers for the goal of installing, of getting rid of Saddam Hussein, and of installing in power Dawa and SCIRI, two Iranian-supported Shiite parties. They failed. In 2003, the U.S. went in, and who is it that is in power in Iraq but the Dawa has the prime ministership, SCIRI plays a major role. Talk about unintended consequences. In Afghanistan, the United States is embarked on a counterinsurgency, I want to be clear about the operation we took to remove the Taliban, to drive out-- to try to kill and capture Al-Qaeda was correct, morally justified, endorsed by the U.N. Security Council, but that mission has now morphed into an exercise aimed at building a central government in a country that has never had a strong central government and a counterinsurgency strategy that requires-- if General Petraeus were here, its architect, he would say just what I’m going to say-- it requires a local partner for it to work. Our partner in Afghanistan is Hamid Karzai who presides over what transparency internationals described as the second-most corrupt country in the world-- number one is Somalia which doesn’t have a government at all-- is ineffective, illegitimate, having stolen his last election through massive fraud, and as a result, the strategy doesn’t work. We have invested billions in training an Afghan police force. Our idea is that by training an Afghan police force, they'll be partners who can provide security, and why do we train the police? Because that’s what we know how to do, but the problem in Afghanistan is the police are the visible face of a corrupt Afghan regime. The money that we’ve spent building roads so farmers can bring their products to market in Afghanistan isn’t working because, yes, the roads are there, farmers don’t bring their product to market because the police rip them off by more than the value of the market. We can train the police to be policemen, but we cannot make them honest. Afghanistan is also another case of the unintended consequences of our actions. We are spending this year $117 billion on the Afghanistan war. To fight an enemy, the Taliban, whose budget is estimated between $70 million and $200 million, and how do the Taliban fund themselves? From the United States. Why? Because to supply our military in Afghanistan, we bring in supplies to the Pakistani port of Karachi, they go through Taliban-controlled territory. The contractors pay off the Taliban. And with the money used to pay for U.S. troops in Afghanistan, we ourselves are financing the Taliban. Now look at this from the point of view from the extremists. We can spend $70 million and get the U.S. to spend $117 billion. That is a pretty good investment. So, our position is simple. We need to scale back what the United States is doing in the world. Yes, to continue global engagements. Yes, to working with allies. But no to this ambitious overreaching. Yes to being smart. So, please join me in supporting the proposition that it is time to clip America’s global wings.Thank you, Peter Galbraith. And that’s our motion: ""It's time to clip America's global wings."" And here to speak first against the motion, I’d like to introduce Eliot Cohen. He’s a professor of strategic studies at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. He’s a former counselor at the Department of State, former Army Reserve officer, so he’s worked with an elite force, former faculty member at Harvard, so he’s worked with a force of elitists, and-- and, given the fact that you have a son who has done two tours in Iraq, none of this is theoretical for you, is it?No, it’s not theoretical for a lot of people both here and abroad.Ladies and gentlemen, Eliot Cohen.Well, I can see one of our challenges tonight on the con team is to make it very clear that our opponents stick to what the debate’s about. The topic of the debate was not, “The Iraq War: Good Idea, Bad Idea?” The topic was not, “Afghanistan: Well Conducted, Poorly Conducted?” The topic is should we clip America’s global wings? This is not a debate about President Bush. It’s not a debate about President Obama. It’s not a debate about Iraq. It is not a debate about Libya. It is not debate about Afghanistan. It is most certainly not a debate about whether prudence is better than recklessness. It’s not a debate about military power versus soft power. It is a debate about America’s role in the world. Our view-- my view and the view of the Elliot who can’t spell his own first name correctly-- is very much that of a statesman who said that the United States is an anchor of global security and an advocate for human freedom. That would be President Barack Obama. It is the mainstream view. Now, our colleagues have chosen or have agreed to a metaphor which is not one that I would have signed up to. When you clip a bird’s wings, it can only fly so high or so far. It’s not a question of where you try to get the bird to fly; it’s what the bird can do. So the question that they will have to address is what capabilities should we give up, not what waste should we curtail? We’re all against waste. What regions of the world no longer matter to us? What issues will we ignore? And what will be the consequences when we do so? They’ve already begun by making a number of distinctions, some of which I have to say I find difficult to understand. We have limited objectives in Libya when President Obama has said that Gaddafi has got to go. We have local allies. Exactly who? I’m not quite sure. Our opponents will and have begun making a number of arguments. They will argue-- they have argued that this is way too costly. I would just remind the audience of one statistical fact. The United States today spends something on the order of about five percent of Gross Domestic Product on defense, maybe a little bit more. During the Kennedy administration, that figure was over eight percent, during the Eisenhower administration, over 10 percent. Even with the vast expenses of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, it is not the defense budget that is the cause of our current economic difficulties. Our record is tarnished. Well, the price of action is frequently exposing yourself in that way. There were plenty of air strikes in Bosnia, the war that Ambassador Galbraith favored, that killed civilians. That’s the price of going to war. I want to make a larger point about the world view that Elliot and I share and that, really, I think, informs our position in this. The first is a set of propositions about the United States, of which the most important is this: The United States has always been a global nation from the very beginning. We were born as part of an Atlantic community. From the outset, our trade stretched across the world, to China and to the Middle East. When the United States chose not to act as a global power with global responsibilities, we were not always the ones who paid for that. When we did-- and of course, the time that we all think of is the period after World War II-- it was not simply that the United States used its force wisely, as I believe it did. It built enduring edifices of alliances, institutions and practices that have served us and have served the world well. Fundamentally, I think the difference comes down to this: Elliott and I believe that the United States is a force for good in the world. That doesn't mean that we don't make mistakes. Of course, we will. That is, in many ways, the price of action. But we believe that the United States has been a force for good, can be a force for good and should continue to think of itself that way. We share a second fundamental world view, and that is a view about the nature of our environment. In many ways, we've entered a world which is a dangerous and difficult place, not just thinking of issues like nuclear proliferation or global warming. By the way, it's not clear to me that if you clip America's global wings, why doesn't that cover things like the United States taking the lead on global warming? But beyond that, we live at a time of tremendous movements in human history. I'll just mention two. In the last decade, hundreds of millions of Chinese have risen out of poverty. That is unambiguously a good thing. It is a good thing that countries like China don't have to worry about famine, that Chinese fathers and mothers can have expectations of a better life for their children than they have had. But it is also true that the same economic growth that has pulled hundreds of millions of Chinese out of poverty, arms a military establishment which acts in support of a foreign policy that claims, among other things, territorial rights to the South and East China seas, to include the territory of some of our closest allies like Japan. Well, let's take the dramatic events of recent months, the Arab spring. In many ways, this is say good thing. There's no question about that. It is quite an extraordinary thing to watch. By the way, it's very striking, I think, to me and to many others, that there's not very much-- there's no anti-Americanism in any of that. But there's clearly potential for this to go in a number of directions. Our fundamental position is it's in America's interest to act where we can act, to guide and shape these events and not to be timid and not to be afraid, to exercise leadership that only the United States can lead.Thank you, Eliot Cohen. So here's where we are. We are halfway through the opening round of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate. Our motion is “It's time to clip America's global wings.” I'm John Donvan of ABC News. We have four debaters, two teams of two, fighting it out over our motion. And you've heard two opening statements, and now we're going to go on to the third. Lawrence Korb is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress who served as assistant Secretary of Defense under the Reagan administration. And Lawrence has-- you worked for the Reagan administration, but now you are working for a think tank, you know, populated by a lot of Clinton guys. Is something not adding up in this picture or--What's not adding up is that the Republican Party has changed tremendously since the days of Reagan. Remember when-- in the Reagan administration, when we got into Lebanon, it didn't work, Reagan got out. He raised taxes 11 times when he recognized that supply-side economics was not working. He worked with members of Congress to reform the Social Security system that kept it in balance until this year.I think we might be getting into your set of minutes, so I'm going to--Well, I thought I would take advantage of it.So I'm going to launch you with, ladies and gentlemen, Lawrence Korb.My point is that even if you think the United States should be more involved in the world, the problem is right now we're broke. We borrow 41 cents of every dollar that the federal government spends. We borrow-- put it another way-- $4 billion a day. Now, if you go back and you take a look-- and I know our opponents don't want to talk about the previous administration. Go back to the beginning of this century. The beginning of this century, the United States accounted for one-third of the world's Gross Domestic Product. We spent one- third of what the world spends on military. Here we are today, we account for only one quarter of the world's Gross Domestic Product, but yet we account for half of the world's military expenditures. Five percent of the world's population, which is us, spends half of what the rest of the world spends on defense. Now, remember at the beginning of this century, we had a budget surplus. You may remember the lockbox and all of those debates back in 2000. That surplus was supposed to make sure that Social Security would not run out of money quicker than it has. Where did we end up at the end of this decade? Not with a surplus of about five trillion, but with a deficit of five trillion. And then, of course, when the global economic crisis hit, we had to increase the deficit even more. Now, the question becomes, how do we get there? Defense played a part. The war has played a part. It wasn't the only part, but I think it's important to keep in mind, in 1968, when we had 540,000 people in Vietnam, we balanced the budget. How did we do it? We had a surtax, a war surtax. What happened this time? You can be for or against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But the fact of the matter is we went to war, and we didn't pay for it. In fact, what we did is we cut taxes. We've never done that in our-- in our history. And what happened? The wars cost-- the direct cost a little over a trillion dollars so far. But the indirect costs, as a lot of economists will tell us, we'll be paying for a long time. And Joe Stiglitz up here, a Columbia economist, estimates it'll cost three to $5 trillion. We compounded it during that time by increasing the defense budget, what we call the baseline budget. General McChrystal, who everybody knows, I had the privilege of working with at the Council on Foreign Relations about 10 years ago. Before he went to Afghanistan, basically he was on the joint staff and in charge of the baseline budget. And he told me, when I spoke to him the last time, he said, we didn't have to make any choices. We could have everything. The baseline budget also went up during this particular period. Again, during Vietnam and during Korea which had war costs, we looked into the baseline budget of the programs that didn't contribute to our national security. Now, you don't think the deficit's a problem? Admiral Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said it's the biggest threat to national security. And he says unless we get our economic house in order at home, we can't be strong abroad. Now, the defense and I agree with it. Wasn't the only thing. We as individuals live beyond our means. We all assume that housing prices were going to go up 30 percent a year. And, you know, we made our decisions on that basis. States right now are having a lot of problems because when they had the pension funds for the policemen, the firemen, the teachers, they assumed they would grow eight percent a year. Well, that didn't happen, and they're having problems. Now, the question becomes, okay, now we have these problems. Maybe we should still do a lot more in the world. And again, we're not against involvement. But it has to be selective engagement. You can't deal with every situation. But we've got a lot of challenges at home. You probably have seen all of the statistics. We're 15th in reading, 17th in science, 25th in math. These are our children. Our infrastructure is falling apart. We're 27th in life expectancy. You know, right now, but we are ahead in a couple of things. Obesity is one, and we're also basically first in the amount of debt that we have and the number of people who are below the poverty-- poverty line. And what we're doing, as a country, we're living off our past investments. If you go back and look where we are today, these are all investments we made in the '50s and the '60s. Now, can you cut defense? Yeah, you sure can. If you take a look at what we're spending on defense, and you put it in constant dollars, go back and look at the Cold War average, it was 450 billion. Right now it's 550 billion. How do I know it's too much? Secretary of Defense says $150 billion in inefficiencies. Well, we could take that money and use it to deal with some of the problems at home. And a couple of things, you know, that we could take a look at in terms of if we get back to where we are-- Secretary Gates, Secretary of Defense goes to West Point. We’re not going to send large land armies into Muslim countries again, okay? This is a man who worked for President Reagan, worked for President Bush, is now working for President Obama. Well, if you’re not going to do that, let’s take a look at the size of the Army and the Marine Corps. This is something that you can do. We also have to recognize as a country that not all problems can be solved, nor can we solve them all. And I think, as Peter pointed out, I think Libya’s the perfect example of the way to do that. We used our unique capabilities, we got other people involved, and you know who’s a great example for this, the first President Bush. You may remember in the campaign, President Obama said, “I like President Bush,” and everybody said, “You do?” and he said, “Well, the first President Bush.” The first Persian Gulf War we got over 200,000 troops from other nations, and those who couldn’t send troops, we collected money. We collected so much, we actually made a profit on the war. So it didn’t cost us anything and, in conclusion, we’ve done it before. Eisenhower got us out of Korea, wouldn’t go into Hungary and Poland, or into Vietnam. Nixon got us out of Vietnam, started arms control with the Soviet Union, recognized China, and even Reagan, when he started negotiating with the Russians, you know what Newt Gingrich called him? Neville Chamberlain. Thank you very much.Thank you, Lawrence Korb. Our motion is ""It’s time to clip America’s global wings,"" and now to speak against the motion, Elliott Abrams, he’s a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. He served as a deputy national security adviser in charge of Middle Eastern affairs in the George W. Bush administration. He recently commented himself on the Libya situation by saying the great mistake that the Obama White House had made in its foreign policy-- in its policy towards Gaddafi was believing that Gaddafi was a normal human being. So personality counts in the big picture?Personality counts because in any given time there are three or four or 10 heads of government around the world who are certifiably insane.Ladies and gentlemen, Elliott Abrams.Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all for being here. Listening to these presentations, here I am, batting cleanup here, and I’ve only got seven minutes to correct so many mistakes. You know the joke, the old, old, old joke about the guy who is looking for his keys under the lamppost and the man says to him, “Did you drop your keys here?” and the guy says, “No, but the light’s better here.” Why are we cutting the military budget? We’re cutting the military budget apparently because the military budget got us into the fiscal mess we’re in? Wrong, it didn’t. Let’s start with the fact that we are cutting the military budget already. It isn’t as if we’re in a situation where these global wings are spreading, and the military budget is becoming a gigantic-- I mean, Defense News, February, ""U.S. Air Force Budget Shrinks."" The Air Force, since we’re talking about wings, has been shrinking decade after decade. Armed Forces Journal, ""Tactical Inventory of the Air Force is as Small Today as at any Point Since World War II."" Many of you no doubt read every morning the website entitled, “War is Boring.” It exists. And it's said of the 2010 budget, the new budget includes cuts and additions. The Air Force took the biggest hits. Now, if you’re going to clip our wings, and in fact many of those wings are being clipped, you have to make some assumptions about the world. You have to assume that there will be no war on the Korean Peninsula. You have to assume there'll be no war between Israel and Iran. You have to assume absolute stability in Asia despite the rise of China. You have to assume no 9/11 attack on the United States again, that we wish to respond to. Are you absolutely confident about all of that, confident enough to reduce American power, that in one, or two, or five, or 10 years we may need? You know, the person who summed this up best was actually President Obama in his Nobel speech. “The world must remember that it was not simply international institutions, not just treaties and declarations that brought stability to a post- World War II world. Whatever mistakes we’ve made, the plain fact is this: the United States of America has under-- has helped underwrite global security for more than six decades with the blood of our citizens, and the strength of our arms. The position the other side is taking is a very radical position, I mean, well to the left of President Obama. Now, we have been spreading our wings for some decades as Eliot mentioned. The world is a better place for it. Peter mentioned some of the places where it is a better place. Bosnia was, I think, the example he used. Take a look at Asia today. It’s an interesting thing. You don’t hear the South Koreans, the Taiwanese, the Vietnamese, the Singaporeans, the Indians saying, “Hey, it’s time to clip your global wings,” because they’re afraid of China. And they want our help in balancing a rising China. Look at Vietnam. Some of you will remember the Cam Ranh Bay Naval Base that we had during the Vietnam War. Now-- now, the government of Vietnam has asked us to come back. Their defense minister was quoted as saying, “This port should be a fuel stop for aircraft carriers.” Well, they don’t have any aircraft carriers. He means our aircraft carriers, that they weren’t stopping there to counterbalance China. The idea that we need to diminish the size of our military-- let me quote from a famous American. Getting the Democratic nomination in 2004, John Kerry said, “I will never give any nation or institution a veto over our national security, and I will build a stronger military. We will add 40,000 active duty troops.” That’s John Kerry. These guys are taking a position well to the extreme on these questions. Now the finances. “We have to cut the military budget because we’re broke.” Bill Clinton’s budget director, Alice Rivlin, wrote last week-- last month, excuse me-- quote, “Defense spending is not a cause of the growing projected deficits. It’s the entitlement programs that drive future spending up faster than GDP can grow.” Clinton budget director. The deputy secretary of the Treasury for Bill Clinton, Roger Altman, “Imperial overstretch is not the real issue here. It is fiscal, economic, and political failures at home that are threatening the ability of the United States to exert global influence.” The defense budget has been falling as a percentage of GDP for decades. It’s falling under four percent now. It is scheduled in the next five years to go under three percent of GDP. So what’s the argument they’re making? Really, it’s ideological. American power is bad. Well, that’s not exactly the argument. Peter tells us American power in Bosnia was good. So I guess what it comes down to is this: When is American power bad and when is American power good? Just ask them. And they’ll tell you where we need to intervene and where we don’t. Doesn’t work. If the United States is going to reduce our global wings, if we’re going to reduce our power, we’re going to put ourselves in a situation where we cannot do what we need to do around the globe. Now, who benefits from this? Who benefits? Who benefits if there are more Srebrenicas and Darfurs and Rwandas? The answer is people like Gaddafi and Milosevic and Bashar al-Assad and Saddam Hussein. They benefit. We do not and the people who depend on us and our power for their safety in a very dangerous world, 300 million Americans and hundreds of millions more around the globe. We’ll lose. Do not buy this picture of America that doesn’t exist, with a people and a military and a president just lusting for intervention everywhere, and a military budget that must be decimated if we are to be safe. On the contrary, if we are to be safe, and if the world is to be safe, those global wings need to be strong. Thank you.Thank you, Elliott Abrams. That concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared debate where our motion is ""It's time to clip America's global wings."" Now we want to have you keep in mind how you voted again at the beginning of the evening because at the end of the arguments, we’re going to have you vote again. And the team that has changed the most minds will be declared our winner. Now on to round two where the debaters address each other directly and they also answer questions from the audience and from me. We have two teams of two here at New York University’s Skirball Center for the Performing Arts. We have Peter Galbraith and Lawrence Korb who are arguing for the motion, ""It's time to clip America's global wings."" They’ve been making the argument that America is drastically overreaching. It’s essentially a pragmatic argument, that we cannot afford to overreach much longer. Their opponents, Eliot Cohen and Elliot Abrams, are making somewhat more of a moral argument. They're saying that the U.S. has always been a global power. And when it has chosen not to be so, somebody usually ends up paying in the end. I want to put to the team that's arguing for the motion. Now, your opponents are essentially saying, if we can be involved globally, if we can, we should. Your argument is more, we can't, so we shouldn't. It's about-- it's about, you're putting it in terms of a price tag, or that's certainly how it's sounding to me. And if I'm wrong, I'd like you to correct it. But your opponents are also saying that you just basically find beyond that the use of U.S. power somehow distasteful. Peter Galbraith.Well, I'm looking for the elephant here, the elephant in the room, because we just had a discussion from the opponents of this motion that didn't discuss Iraq and Afghanistan which are the two major projections of American power, the two major expenditures in this millennium. Okay, this century, if you don't want to be too ambitious. The problem with them is that they have ended up weakening the United States. Certainly the Iraq war caused America's prestige, which was sky high after Bosnia and Kosovo to collapse. Turkey, we went from an 80 percent approval rating to a six percent approval rating in the second largest country in NATO. We have ended up empowering Iran. You will recall President Bush describing an axis of evil, of Tehran and Baghdad. They were bitter enemies--But, Peter, are you arguing the principle is the issue or the execution is the issue?It is the execution. It is that we try to do things that we can't do. We tried to--But your opponents are making an argument about principle.Well-- look, they are the George Bush administration, what they represent is probably the most ambitious idealistic American administration. But they didn't succeed.Okay. Let me have--It can't work.--one of the Elliotts come in. Eliot Cohen.I think if you-- by the way, if you notice, the only president we were quoting was Barack Obama.Well, I understand why you wouldn't want to quote Bush.Well, right.That's understandable.With whom we agree on basic principles. And the fact is we didn't talk about Iraq. That was not the topic that was given. And in fact, I think you can think that the Iraq war was a stupid idea, as Barack Obama does, and still think that this is a bad idea.Yeah, but how bad an idea could it have been?Eliot Cohen.You supported it, sir, in 2003. So you don't--You're pointing to Lawrence Korb.No. I'm pointing at Peter Galbraith.Peter Galbraith.But let me say something here. Let me say something here.What's the argument?What we're talking about here is-- and you mention my Republican thing-- the way the Republicans always look at cost benefits. You want to quote someone? Let me quote one of your colleagues, Fukiyama, who wrote the book, “The End of History” and talked about--He's not a Republican, by the way.He was one of the--And neither am I, actually, for the record.--supporters of the war. But you know, Frank said-- and he supported the war, he said, if you had told the American people in 2003, we're going to go to war in Iraq, and we're going to have almost 5,000 Americans die, 30 to 40,000 wounded, hundreds of thousands of Iraqis die, spend over a trillion dollars so Iraq could have an election, you would have been laughed out of the ballpark. You've got to have select-- I remember growing up in New York City at the time of the Polish and Hungarian revolutions. And you had a lot of people from Eastern Europe here. And basically, they wanted the United States to do something. How can you stand by? I remember pictures of Cardinal Mindszenty on the head of The Daily News, ""We've got to do--"" no. Eisenhower made a calculation. When they wanted them to bail out the French at Dien Bien Phu. General Ridgway came to them and said, “Hey, here's the cost.” He said, “Forget it. Bedell Smith, go to”--All right. Let me go to the other side. What you're hearing is an argument that lots of time the U.S. has chosen not to get involved because--Oh, sure.--of the cost. Eliot Cohen-- Elliott Abrams.One of the causes in the world that I do care about a lot is Tibet. I'm not urging us to go to war with China over Tibet. We can’t do it. It would be foolish. But Peter, in 2003, supported the war for the right reasons, I mean morally, the right reasons. What he said was he thought there would be just massacres in Kurdistan, and there would be massacres of the Shia, and indeed, there had already been. Those are, I think, morally compelling arguments for why we did what we did. And we avoided those massacres. And in fact, the Kurds are doing very well now, and there is a Shia majority government, democratic government in Iraq. I also don't accept the view that the Iraq war has been lost. It wasn't lost in 2007, wasn't when you said it was. Wasn't lost in 2008 or '9. It isn't lost now. It may be too soon to say what the final outcome in Iraq is going to be, but it certainly isn't lost. But I just don't understand how you can say, no, it was-- it would have been right to just let the Kurds and the Shia be slaughtered by Saddam Hussein. And, by the way--Well, let me let Peter Galbraith reply directly to that because you worked with the Kurds quite a bit. What about that?Well, there's no doubt that the people-- the peoples of Iraq-- because there isn't such a thing as an Iraqi nation. But that the peoples of Iraq, 80 percent of whom are either Kurds or Shiites have emerged much better off. And possibly, if we had gone in, gotten rid of Saddam Hussein and gotten out, if we hadn't undertaken the Bremer multibillion dollar occupation where we had people-- sent young people in there with no experience to run the Iraqi budget, to draw up the traffic plans for Baghdad, that's how ambitious we were. We were doing American traffic plans for Baghdad. You know, but we'd gotten rid of Saddam, gotten out, it might have been a rather different history. But you cannot say that this was worth nearly a trillion dollars, especially when it meant that Iran, which had been intimidated in 2003-- its nuclear program was on hold-- had become emboldened in part because its best friends were now running Iraq. And North Korea took advantage of this to get a free pass. I think all of us would agree that proliferation--Was it worth a trillion dollars? Eliot Cohen, can you speak to, was it worth a trillion dollars?So let me get this straight. If we invade Iraq, we depose Saddam Hussein and leave, that's an America whose global wings have been clipped, which is a good thing.No, we shouldn’t-- He was contained.That just-- that just makes-- That just makes no sense.Wait, wait. Let Eliot finish.We'll come back to your point, by the way. Since when I was in government, I was looking at the intelligence on the Iranian parliament. It is very curious how they stopped their war head design program immediately after a major geopolitical event that occurred to their West. And that may have had a passing connection with it.Lawrence Korb.And they started it back when they saw how incompetent we were, the kind of investment we were making--We-- we're losing confidence is better than incompetence.Lawrence Korb.That's not the topic being debated.I think-- and we get back-- look, there's a lot of evil in the world, and you have to decide whether the potential benefits are worth the costs that you have to pay. And that's why if you had told the American people that in the beginning, regardless of the outcome, you never would have gotten support. If you had asked people to raise taxes and to have a draft, which we should have done because of the fact that we overworked a lot of these young people, sent them back-- when I was in government, we got the voluntary military going. We made a compact with the young people. For every year you spend in the combat zone, you get at least two years at home. It didn't work. Okay, you got 500,000 people, according to RAND, who have mental problems because of being over-deployed.If you took Iraq and Afghanistan out of this equation, Peter Galbraith, where do you disagree with the other side?Well, I'm in favor of a more limited role where we have allies intervening where-- if we are to intervene, to intervene where we have allies, generally consistent with international law, where there are partners on the ground. I think there are circumstances--And you think your opponents are for what?Libya is another.But you think your opponent's position is what then?Well, they don't want to talk about Afghanistan and Iraq and this very expansive nation- building enterprise in which both of them were-- administration in which both of them were very intimately involved. Now, if their position is that they are also in favor-- you know that they will never do that kind of thing again, and that they'll clip America's wings because we're not going to try-- and we'll get out of Afghanistan or reduce our forces to something that's commensurate with an achievable mission, then maybe we're on the same wavelength. Are they in favor of the hundred thousand dollar mission--A hundred thousand dollar mission in Afghanistan?But, Peter, let Elliott Abrams come in.Here's the problem with that. First of all, you guys disagree about Iraq because Peter correctly, in my view said, you know, if we had been able to go in, depose Saddam Hussein, save the Kurds and the Shia and then, in your view, get out, that would have been worth doing. Now, how in hell do you go into Iraq and depose Saddam Hussein in three weeks with your clipped wings? You can't do it. You need to maintain the military that Larry doesn’t want us to maintain in order to achieve exactly that goal.Wait, wait. Wait a second.Larry Korb--We went in with--Okay, Larry Korb.--Bill Clinton's military, the one you said wasn’t big enough. It wasn’t Bush's military that went in.It was John Kerry, I'm sorry.And we were spending on defense, about half on the baseline of what we’re spending now. And we marched through Baghdad in three weeks.Could I make a request in this debate that this not become Republican-Democrat, and that, that old-- that old shape-- Okay? Not to say that the wars we’re talking about are not material, but I don’t want to go down that old ground. I think we’re talking about something fairly important here and I think we are talking about principles. And it does sound to me as though these two sides agree on the broad principle that the U.S. has a role in the world, wants to try to influence events. Both sides are agreeing on that, and I’m beginning to wonder where the essential disagreement really is unless you are saying it just costs too much on this side and on your side I’m not sure what your comeback is to that.It doesn’t cost too much. The fact is that--Elliott Abrams.--the percentage of GDP that we are spending on defense continues to decline. What is going up in this country, and I think everybody here knows it, is entitlement spending, and that is what has tied the Congress in knots, because there are very few politicians in either party bold enough to deal with entitlement spending. We are not broke because of the military budget.Now wait a second, wait a second. Let’s go back and take a look. You look at the discretionary budget, the budget that doesn’t deal with entitlements, things that people have earned, like military retirement, these thing-- if you look at discretion-- defense is half of the discretionary budget. And right now the politicians of Washington have frozen nondefense discretionary. That’s not going to help, I agree we need to take a look at the other things. I mentioned President Reagan in 1983 worked on it. But the fact of the matter is you don’t just ignore half of the discretionary budget, particularly if you cut it. And you mentioned Alice Rivlin. Did you read the report of the Domenici-Rivlin Commission?No. She said cut $100 billion in defense by 2015.All right, I want to go to the audience for some questions in a moment. I’d like you to prepare your questions, again, terse questions that have a question mark at the end, and to the point of the debate, and microphones will circulate and when you’re chosen and a microphone comes to you, please stand up and hold it about a fist distance away from your mouth so that the radio audience will be able to hear you clearly. But I want to take one more shot at this issue of whether we’re really talking about execution and price tag only, if in a fantasy world, and it may be therefore irrelevant, if we had unlimited resources, would that mean to the side that’s arguing for clipping America’s wings, carrying your argument out, that our limitation is financial only if we didn’t have that limitation, would you be for doing all kinds of zany stuff out there?Well, Afghanistan is the perfect case in point, and this is probably an issue in which we have a very concrete ongoing difference. In Afghanistan we have 100,000 troops, $117 billion committed to a strategy which cannot work because it-- the essential element for success which is an Afghan partner does not exist. So we don’t need to-- and yet I suspect they would continue this. Well, why don’t we put it to them?Yeah good question.I mean, how do you make a counterinsurgency work when you don’t have a partner?Eliot Cohen.First I wouldn't say that we don’t have a partner, I mean we have a weak partner. If we had a strong partner there wouldn’t be an insurgency because these things are basically about governance. And do I think we’re going to be there for a long time? Yes. Do I think we had any choice about going in there? No. Remember, this was the good war. This is the war that everybody I dare say including both of you were in favor of in 2001. And it is the problem that Elliot has pointed out which is correct, once you go in there-- so what exactly are you going to do, are you just going to sort of leave the thing in chaos and not do anything? Now we can argue back and forth about did we do the smart thing, did we do the stupid thing, should we have backed somebody other than Karzai, should we have organized that place differently, should we have had different ambassadors? That’s not the point. The point is this proposition about clipping America’s global wings. By the way, I cannot imagine Ronald Reagan ever signing up for that sort of proposition. And as long as I have the floor, one other--For about 10 seconds,--tell me how cutting the defense budget by $100 billion makes all the fat people out there lose weight-- increases life expectancy and gets the kids away from Nintendo and into the calculus books. I don’t get it.Now, let me come back--Lawrence Korb.Let me make a point here, because I agree. We went into Afghanistan. The problem was and this is what I’m talking about, clipping your wings, selective engagement. You didn’t finish the job in Afghanistan. You diverted your attention to Iraq. And you allowed Afghanistan to deteriorate. I agree, Afghanistan was the right war. And, in fact, I commended President Bush because he told-- in the beginning, he said to the Taliban, “You turn over al-Qaeda, we’ll leave you alone.” They didn’t, so we went in. We had to. The problem was, within months, we started diverting our attention to Iraq, which was not a critical issue, had nothing to do with 9/11. Back when Eisenhower was president, we were spending 10 percent of the GDP on defense, we didn’t go into Vietnam.One more thing before we go to audience questions. Eliot Cohen, you said earlier that you feel your opponents basically think that power is bad, but I’m not hearing that from them at all. I’m sorry, Elliot Abrams-- was it Elliot Abrams that made that point about--Yes. We’re practically interchangeable.Just for the spelling, but other than that--So, I’m not hearing that.If you find that the defense budget is not killing our economy, and I think it’s ridiculous to urge that it is, then why are we doing this wing-clipping stuff? What is it we’re trying to stop? The only word I’ve heard is nation-building. Now, you know, we did nation building in Germany after World War II. We did it Japan after World War II. We’re trying to do it in a number of other places. Generally, people are ending up a lot better off after we try to do the nation-building. So I think ask myself, well, if we’re trying to build democracy-- this is Colin Powell’s old “you break it, you bought it,” the Pottery Barn rule-- we go into the country and we say, “No, we’re not going to depose the head of government and leave it a shambles. We’re going to try to help them build a decent country here and build a democracy.” That’s a good thing to do, and I must say I don’t understand the argument except financial for saying--But I’m still not hearing you respond to your earlier statements that this team actually is uncomfortable exerting American power. That’s what I-- it sounded like you’re saying it, and yet I don’t think that that’s any--If they are comfortable asserting American power, then I think their argument simply falls apart or becomes just a sort of financial argument, that we would love to run the world, but, you know, we’re broke this year.No, no, no, no. We’re not saying that. We’re saying trying to run the world does cost you a lot of money that you don’t have to spend. And, even if--But you’re good with running the world.If you had all the money, you got to look at selective engagement. You cannot save the world, okay? There are a lot of problems in the world that you can’t deal with that you have to live with. You ask me what’s the most dangerous place in the world? Pakistan. All right? You want to send troops into Pakistan? Okay? You’re not going to do that. And, again, you should have thought about that before you went into, you know, you went into Iraq and took your eye off the ball in Afghanistan.All right. Let me go to some questions. And there’s a gentleman-- I’m looking right-- yes, and you gestured correctly. If you would stand, sir, and give the camera four seconds to find you, and it has. And, again, if anyone is asking questions is a member of the media, we’d appreciate you identifying yourself. Just do us a favor. But please, go ahead.Yes, I have a question for Mr. Abrams. Doesn’t the law of unintended consequences rear its head, for example, in Somalia we went in to restore order, and we wound up with Black Hawk Down and the troops being dragged through the street. We funded the mujahedeen in Afghanistan. That turned out to be al-Qaeda. You mentioned Rwanda. You had two African tribes hacking each other up with machetes. Do you really want to send American troops into these places when, frequently, it turns-- it backfires to our detriment?Do you think those were overreaches of power?Well, obviously, you have-- basically, you judge a situation by what happened, by the consequences, not by what was intended. But, obviously, in those situations--By the outcome.We downed it to our detriment.All right. Elliot Abrams.The question of unintended consequences is a very important question. And you can cite a number of examples where we-- for over 50 years, where we did something wrong or foolishly or incompetently. But take Rwanda, your example. There are hundreds of thousands of dead people in Rwanda because we did nothing. And Bill Clinton has said it is the greatest regret, he has said, about his presidency, that he did nothing to stop it. Now, the repertoire is large and doesn’t only include sending in the Marines. We have no marines in Libya, but we are intervening in a way that is meant to do some good, and with which I agree. So, yeah, you’ve got to-- I guess the argument is, yes, you need to be very careful whenever you commit American troops. You need to be very careful even if you’re not committing American troops. You’re committing American prestige and money. But I don’t think that can be an argument for inaction. It can’t be an argument for saying, “We don’t really know what’s going to happen tomorrow in Srebrenica. Let’s not go in. We don't really know if Saddam Hussein will massacre the Kurds. Let's leave it alone. It takes you too far.”Peter Galbraith, you want to follow on that as an opponent?Well, I think the question of the mujahedeen in Afghanistan's a very good one because we simply allowed the Pakistani dictator, Zia-ul-Haq under the Reagan administration, to decide who to fund. And he funded the most extreme elements. And we are now living with the consequences of that. I want to come to the question of, you know, should web in the business of nation building, building democracies? Yes. We had an interest in removing the Taliban. We had an interest in trying to kill or capture al-Qaeda. What interest did we have in trying to build a strong central government in Afghanistan, a place that has never had one and will not have one in the lifetime of anybody sitting in this room, even young people?Okay. I--What interest did we have in--Peter, I'm going to interrupt because that was a self-asked question, and I'm-- I'm wanting to really hear from the audience in this. But that doesn't mean you can't get to that in your closing remarks. Let me just go to the far side here. And there's-- yeah. You have a colorful sleeve. You're welcome. And if you could stand up, they'll find you. Could you stand? Thanks.Yeah, I'd just like to ask, you're talking about cutting-- to Mr. Abrams-- about cutting entitlements as one way to deal with America's deficit problem. But not a single one of the panelists tonight has talked about tax extensions or tax breaks to the super wealthy or to--All right. Lovely question.And that is a huge hole in this argument.And stay tuned for a future debate from Intelligence Squared U.S. on that topic. Thank you. I really want to stay on the power clipping issue.--taxes to support the war.Sir, there's a-- a little farther back, three back. If you could stand, thanks.President Eisenhower spoke of the military industrial complex. And as long as we have so many people in the military and government and in business interested in creating such a great military industrial complex, won't we continue to be in these kinds of wars and have these kinds of--But how would you relate that, sir, to our motion about clipping--Well, I think part of the reason we're not clipping America's global wings is enough people are interested in keeping the military. And once you-- you have a large military, somebody's going to use it.All right. I'm going to let that stand as a comment because it's not quite to our point. Ma'am in the blue-- teal, the teal. Is that teal? Did I get that right?Huge number of-- I'd like to commend the lady over there for having questioned the attack on entitlements. I believe Mr. Abrams spoke about the Marshall Plan having been a very constructive thing. What about a Marshall Plan for the American people who are now suffering--Okay. I'm going to let that stand as a comment as well. It's clear that we know what your view is. Folks, really-- I really want you to try to bring it in, just to land these things perfectly. Sir, blue Blazer, yeah.Yeah, hi. I think to the point, I don't know if--Thank you.Yeah, I don't know if the story is true, but I've heard that Benjamin Franklin apparently wanted the turkey to be our national bird. But we chose instead the eagle, a bird with strong wings. And I think the argument can be made that America without strong wings is simply not America.You think it's an identity issue literally?I think it has to do with who we are and why we're here.All right. Do you feel that this--The question is, I think the argument is being made strongly that perhaps we should be-- we should not be stupid in how we use our strength and our wealth and our forces. We should be smarter about how we do it. But can you really argue that America should clip its wings as opposed to simply being smarter and more efficient about how we use--Lawrence Korb. And that's such a great question. And don't miss it, okay?Since you used a metaphor here, there's a great book written by a professor here at this wonderful university, Peter Beinart. It's called “The Icarus Syndrome.” And he said throughout our history, we get carried away thinking that because of who we are we can solve all the world's problems. And he goes back, and he talks about Vietnam where we went in, we thought the domino theory and all of that type of thing, found out we even-- when our economy was much better, we still could not achieve the objective that we wanted. And that's what-- you used the term, you've got to be smart about it, there are certain things you've got to do, other things you realize that they're beyond your capacity. And I think that's the key thing. Now, at this particular time, we talk about the fact that defense has nothing to do with it. No. We added $2 trillion to the deficit in the last decade because of actions that happened from 2001 to 2008, okay? If we had those $2 trillion, the other problems would not be as bad. And so that's the point I'm making.All right. Let's hear from your opponents on this topic, Eliot Cohen.On the-- on the eagle, the national seal has the eagle clutching arrows and olive branches. And originally, the eagle pointed at the arrows. And Harry Truman welcomed Winston Churchill to the White House. And he very proudly pointed to him that he'd redesigned the seal so that the eagle's head looked at the olive branches. And Churchill said-- wise thing. He said, ""You know, my view is the eagle's head should be mounted on a swivel."" So it can look either at the olive branch or at the arrows as is necessary. He didn't say anything about clipping the damn bird's wings.Thank you, sir, for the question. With the program in your hand, arise, and a microphone will find its way to you. Question.The side in favor of the resolution has talked about a lot of interventions in retrospect and the cost and how we have allies that aren't accountable or are corrupt. And I want to know from both sides what criteria you think the American public ought to use right now to determine which interventions are acceptable, which ones are not?What are the rules, in other words? Can you-- I'd like to ask you-- I'd like to ask you each to answer this excellent question in-- no, seriously, but in a bullet format. I'd just like to hear your list from each side, what it takes. And I know that, Peter, you actually touched on some of it earlier. But either of you can take it and tell us the four or five most important elements.I was-- I'm glad you asked the question because I was just writing down some bullet points on exactly this. First, I think when we intervene, it's very important that we operate with the vision of the people on whose behalf we are intervening, not ours. I think that's my main critique of what we've done in Iraq and Afghanistan. Why did we want to disassemble Kurdistan and Iraq? It worked. Why build a central government? But that would, to me, be the most important point. Second--And what else?Defer to the judgment of others, including in the international community, the U.N., our allies. Don't go it alone. And finally, I would take a count of the costs and the benefits. When we intervened in Bosnia, it was a-- yes, it was by air, but it was for a short period of time, relatively inexpensive incidentally, and all our interventions in both Bosnia, Kosovo, not a single American or NATO soldier died in hostile combat--Okay. Let me go to the other--And finally-- finally, as a Vermonter, I have to say, turkeys have very strong wings. We have lots of wild turkeys.Now to this side.Yeah. I--Eliot Cohen, question.First thing I think when you're talking about the use of force, the question is always, are we going to avoid something worse. And I think that it's important to be very serious about this. Using force is a terrible thing. You're going to kill innocent civilians. You're going to make mistakes. You'll probably get some of your own people killed. And those are real people. Are you going to avoid something worse? That's really the fundamental reason why we do go to war, and we should go to war. Is this doable as far as we can-- as far as we can guess? And it is a guess. Is it in our self-interest? And is it in our broader interest as Americans? From the very founding of this country, we're caught between the tension between the same kind of interest that other countries have and our ideals. That's what it is to be an American. And it's incumbent upon our leaders to wrestle with that and to lay it out for us. But above all, at the end of it, don't think that any of us can come up with a set of rules which we can, you know, give you, and that's a sort of a decision making guide that any president can take with him or her to make a decision.No, but the question did reveal a great deal with how the two sides think. And I thank you for it. And I want to take it one step further. I want you to respond to the list that you heard over there, and do you have any disagreement with it? Or would you add his list to your list?I would--I would critical question here. And I think Elliott is right in saying when we intervene militarily, the chances are that some innocent people and some American servicemen and women will be killed. So the question is to what end? And if the answer is, I'm not sure, you don't do it. If the answer is, to save a million lives, or 500,000 lives, to stop Darfur, to stop Srebrenica, then the balance may shift.Okay, and, Lawrence, can you respond to what you heard?Well, I’m going to very quickly--Lawrence, can you respond to their list?Okay.Thanks.I have very quick Multilateral if you can, unilateral only if you must. I think that's what you have to do, and you have to basically ask yourself that question and the same thing in terms of what you can't know exactly ahead of time but you can do a pretty good idea of the cost and the benefits and recognize that you don't just use the military to solve all these problems.Okay, so that's your list. What's your response to what you heard from the other side? Would you-- do you agree with what they--Well, my response to them is basically if you take a look at a lot of the operations we do, they haven’t done that ahead of time in terms of the cost and the benefits.Guilty?You have to take the point that Eliot made at the end, you can’t predict the future or at least you can’t predict it perfectly. You do the best you can, you use the best intel you can, you try to make the best guess as to what the costs will be and what the benefits will be, and sometimes you get it on the dime, and sometimes you’re way off.According to Colin Powell--Look, I----Bush never did that before he went into Iraq.Eliot Cohen.Never wasEliot Cohen.I’ve sat in NSC meetings and I know first that presidents take these issues very, very seriously, particularly when they're committing American lives. That was true of George W. Bush, was true of Barack Obama, it was true of Bill Clinton. I also know that none of these decisions are easy. They don’t get to that level if they were easy, and so there are always going to be-- there’s going to be an element of guesswork, and then an element of risk. The other thing, by the way, is we have really focused, because this is the preoccupation of the other team, on these high end interventions. There are other kinds of things. Let’s talk about the Sudan peace process, let’s talk about what’s been really quite a tremendous success in Columbia which has been an exercise of American power in many dimensions including the nonmilitary, this is not a debate about American military power, it’s America’s global wings, and those wings include a lot of nonmilitary elements which have been tremendously successful.All right, we’re going to take a quick break. Our motion is, “It’s time to clip America’s global wings.” We’re going to take a quick break, and we’ll be right back with more questions from the audience. So I’m going to ask you in a second to help assist coming back from the break in the radio broadcast and television broadcast to applaud, and once you do and as the applause dies away, I’ll reintroduce the broadcast and we’ll go back to your questions. So can I have a round of applause, please? Our motion is, ""It’s time to clip America’s global wings."" This is a debate from Intelligence Squared U.S. I’m John Donvan of ABC News. We have two debaters, two teams of two, debating this motion, ""It’s time to clip America’s global wings."" We are taking questions from the audience. The man in the blue shirt, you’ve been very patient.Oh, I’m sorry. You know, everybody in the audience could’ve stood up at that point. I’m sorry.I grew up as a child in Africa surrounded on one side by Cubans and on another side by Russians, who were spreading their wings, and the one safe thing we always felt as children was, we had the United States, and we were enfolded within its wings. What would you feel if we clipped the wings with Russia now, with-- I beg your pardon-- China now spreading its wings, and you now clip your wings, how secure would everybody feel?Do you-- and I want to clarify-- do you feel that that’s the argument that this side, arguing for clipping wings, is making?Yeah, I feel--You do, that they’re putting you at risk?I feel they’re putting us at risk.All right, I want to take that question to the side that’s arguing for clipping America’s global wings.Let me go--Lawrence Korb.I think you raise a great point. China is gaining because we’re bogged down in Afghanistan. They would love us to be there forever, keep spending all of this money and help their a foreign policy objectives. They’re a free rider in the Middle East. We’re doing-- what’s China doing? Sitting back and taking advantage of it. So I think our point is that, you know, when you say clip your wings, you’ve got to work with the rest of the community. We can’t have too many free riders. It’s very interesting when the deficit came ","cornell-intelligence-squared-debates"
"religion","We are now in our fifth season. We've done more than 50 of these debates. And we're delighted to have all of you here. But they all happen because of one man, Robert Rosenkranz, who is the chairman of the Rosenkranz Foundation, who brought Intelligence Squared to the city and to this country, in fact. And so I'd like to welcome him to make opening remarks and set the frame for what we're actually talking about here.Bless you for coming. Intelligence Squared is primarily known as a public policy debate series, so I'd like to start the evening by sharing with you the reasons we wanted to do a debate about religion. America has always incorporated complex ideas about religion in its political culture. Creationism is invoked in the most famous words of our founding documents, ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights.""The First Amendment to the Constitution begins with the ringing words, ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion."" But note these words do not banish religion from the public square. Indeed, many of the original 13 colonies had official state religions which the amendment protects from the actions of Congress. Nor is there any constitutional issue when the president, in his role as commander in chief, hires ministers and rabbis and priests to perform religious duties as member of the Armed Forces. Tonight's debate should prove equally complex. Proponents of the motion might cite the violence perpetrated in the name of religion while opponents will counter that most warfare throughout history was totally or primarily about territory and economic advantage. Proponents might cite the absence of proof for central religious beliefs, indeed, the repugnance of some of them, while opponents emphasize the utility of faith and ritual and helping believers cope with the challenges of life. But both sides are likely to concur that every well-ordered society needs some key moral principles and that every thoughtful person needs a sense of meaning and purpose in life. The key question for tonight's debate, the complex question, is whether those central needs can be better met in a world with or without religion. We have a very outstanding panelist group tonight with us. And it's my privilege at this point to turn the evening back to John Donvan and to our great panel.Thank you. Thank you. And I just-- I would really like to invite one more round of applause for Robert Rosenkranz for making this all possible. True or false, the world would be better off without religion? That's what we're here to debate, another verbal joust from Intelligence Squared U.S. I'm John Donvan of ABC News. We are at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University. The world would be better off without religion. Two teams will argue that proposition from opposite sides, one for and one against. And only one team will win. You are live judges. You, our live audience, will be the judges. Let's meet our debaters. They include on the team arguing for the motion, the great-great-grandson of Charles Darwin, author and filmmaker, Matthew Chapman. By his side and on his side, a philosopher who takes a humanistic view of ethics, master of the new College of the Humanities, A.C. Grayling. them, and here to argue against the motion is one of the most influential conservative thinkers in the nation, president of the King's College, Dinesh D'Souza. And his teammate is the rabbi of Sinai temple in Los Angeles, California, David Wolpe. So this is a contest. It's a debate. And you, our audience here at the Skirball Center, will decide the winner. By the time the debate has ended, we'll have asked you to vote two times, once before and once again at the end. And the team that has changed the most minds, the team that has moved its numbers the most will be declared our winner. So let's go on to the preliminary vote. You have a keypad at your seat on the right hand side. And our motion is, again, ""The world would be better off without religion."" And if you agree with this motion, and it's a negative, without, if you agree with this motion, means you want less religion, push number one. It's these guys. If you disagree with this motion, push number two. And if you're undecided, push number three. You can ignore the other numbers. And if you made an error, just correct it, and the system will lock in your last vote. So remember, we're going to let you know at the end of the debate what that baseline number is, and we're going to have you vote a second time after the third round. We go in three rounds, opening statements, a middle round where you're involved, and the debaters address one another directly, and then a closing round of short summary statements. So let's get started. Onto round one. Our motion is, ""The world would be better off without religion."" And here to speak in support of the motion, A.C. Grayling, Anthony Grayling, philosopher. Put that on your business card, I guess. But it's true. In addition to your current position at the New College of the Humanities, the number of books that you have written on philosophy is now approaching three dozen? And I understand that as an undergraduate at the University of Sussex, you decided you needed more college, more university. So simultaneously, you pursued a second Bachelor of Arts degree up in London, so you did college twice at the same time? Is that-- what else did--Yes, it's true. It's crazy.What did you do in your spare time?Yeah. It's crazy, but it's true.Ladies and gentlemen, A.C. Grayling.Thank you. John, thank you very much indeed. I must begin by asking you, if I may, to focus on what the proposition is before us. We're not here to discuss the existence of God. We are not here to discuss whether it's rational, irrational to have faith. We're here to discuss a sociological phenomenon, a man-made phenomenon, religion. You can see the difference. You might call in question whether or not gods and goddesses. But you can't call in question whether or not there is religion. There's plenty of it. History is full of it, and it exists around us all the time today. By the way, I say that religion is man- made advisedly. There are very few women indeed in the upper half of hierarchies of the world's religions, which perhaps has something to do with the point. Now, religions are very diverse in nature. They have different interpretations of their deities. They say different things about what we can wear and what we can eat and when, how many wives we can have, what rituals we must follow. Despite the fact that they all take the view that they've got the right story, they differ from one another quite dramatically in a number of respects. And this is why, through the course of history, they've burdened mankind with a huge number of conflicts and a great deal of divisiveness. But I'm not going to bore you by rehearsing the story of crusades and inquisitions and the rest. It's a very familiar matter. Although it is, of course, in the interests of apologists of religions to try to forget them. Rather, I wanted to talk about things that religions have in common with one another rather than the things that divide them. They have two things in common with one another. Most of the time in history, and among many of the orthodox manifestations of religion today, they are similar to one another in-- most of them, giving second-class status to women and being hostile to gays, in being very opposed to most kinds of progress, especially scientific progress. The reason being, of course, that they take it that they received the truth a long time ago, anything between one and 3,000 years ago. And so things that are challenging and are new and offer us different views of the world, they find unpalatable. And so they tend to be very traditionalist, very conservative and rather retrogressive. And that explains a great deal of the social policy and political endeavor that the religions engage in. That's one thing that they tend to have in common with one another. But another thing they have in common with one another, a very important point, is that they share a structural feature. In fact, they are-- the religions are paradigmatic of a certain kind of organization, what I call a monolithic ideology, a one-size-fits all, top- down, totalizing ideology which says we've got the right story, and you've got to sign up for it. If you don't sign up for our story, if you don't agree, you are going to pay a sanction of one kind or another. And during the course of history, those sanctions have sometimes been very terrible. It's in this respect in which religions in history and in their orthodox manifestations now, plus in all their manifestations, tend to share with other kinds of totalizing ideologies. So that's why it's no great surprise that Joseph Stalin, for example, was educated in the seminary. What those totalitarianisms share is very, very common. inquisition in Spain in the 15th century and Stalin's Soviet Union in the 20th century say the same thing, ""We've got the answer, you've got to agree, and if you don't, you're in trouble.""So they have these two features, and the second of them, the structural feature, the idea of being in charge of the truth or of possessing the right story about life in the universe is very opposed to the enlightenment outlook on which our modern Western liberal democracies are based, the enlightenment of the 18th century taught us to think that there isn't one right answer for everybody. It taught us pluralism, taught us individual autonomy, it taught us liberty of conscience, it taught us democracy. Democracy is about people having a conversation, the great conversation of society in which we negotiate with one another about how we go forward, how we organize ourselves in society, and that's very different indeed from thinking that there is one great ruler, one monarch, whether in the sky or on the ground, who tells us what we should do, and that we mustn't think for ourselves, but we must all be orthodox, and indeed this ethical point is a very important one. There are those people who think that you can't have religion-- you can't have morality without religion, and of course, that isn't true. Everything good about religious morality, loving your neighbor, kindness, concern for others, responsibility as a member of the community, is shared by nonreligious ethical outlooks also. They're very common to all the great ethical theories. I'm an atheist and a humanist, and those values matter deeply to me. If you look at ancient Greek philosophy for example, a dominant strain of thought for nearly 1,000 years before Christianity came to command the mind of Europe, and you see that those values were shared by those thinkers, not because they thought they were told them by a deity but because reason and human experience had offered it to them. And the final point is this. People say, ""What's wrong with moderate religion?"" you know, those nice folks who go to church on Sundays and who take part in their neighborhoods. And here's the problem with that, moderate religion is religion where people do a little bit of cherry picking. They take the best bits of the religion, and some of the more embarrassing, or difficult, or awkward, or rebarbative bits they leave to one side. I know very, very few Christians who give away all they own to the poor, who take no thought for tomorrow, who turn their backs on their families if their families disagree and families are going to disagree if they do give away everything, who don't marry, who stay celibate. I find very few Christians actually live the New Testament morality, they cherry pick. Unkind people would call that ""hypocrisy."" At the other end of the scale, however, are those who take their religion extremely seriously, the extremists, we call it them. The point about the extremists is that they are the most honest of the people who have a religious view because they commit themselves to what their tradition tells them, and they stay closest to the text. Now, if that's real religion, that's honest religion, the world is very much better off without it. And if the world is much better off without the true and the honest form of religion, why not put the hypocrites in with them, too? Thank you.Thank you. Thank you, Anthony Grayling. Our motion is ""The world would be better off without religion,"" and here to speak against the motion, David Wolpe. He's the rabbi of Sinai Temple in Los Angeles, California. Newsweek Magazine named you-- what is this, the way it was phrased, the number one pulpit rabbi in America.I hope we're not voting on that tonight.I just want to-- I mean, do they have playoffs or--Oh, yes. Yeah, stadiums, playoffs, National league, American league.All right. Ladies and gentlemen-- this pulpit is yours--Thank you.--David Wolpe.The caustic and brilliant philosopher at Columbia University, Sidney Morgenbesser, was once sitting in the back of a lecture where the English philosopher, J.L. Austin, said that we know that two negatives make a positive, if I say I will never not miss you, it means I'll always miss you. But he said there's no language in which two positives make a negative. And from the back of the auditorium Morgenbesser said, yeah, right. Now, I'm going to offer you two positives. I hope not only that they will add to a positive but that you will approach this not in that skeptical frame of mind but at least open to the possibility that there's a lot about religion that you don't hear. You will never see a headline that says religious man feeds hungry man. But it happens all the time. In fact you might be surprised to know what the largest aid organization in the world is. It’s called World Vision, with over 40,000 people in over 100 countries. That’s more than CARE, Save the Children, the worldwide operations of the United States Agency for International Development all combined. And if you didn’t know that, it’s because the good that religion does is sort of oft interred with its bones, but you hear about every depredation, every sin, every bad thing. And yet today, all over the world, there are millions of religious aid workers who are sustaining people in places that you’ve never heard of and never visited. Right before this conference, both Dinesh and I were in Mexico in Puebla at the Festival of Ideas, and I rode back to the airport with Nicholas Kristof from the New York Times and we were talking about this issue. And he said, “You know, everywhere I go, I see religious aid workers, day after day, year after year, and the difference,” he said, “between religious aid workers and others is they stay.” They don’t go when the crisis is over. And this parallels my own experience when I was in Haiti, helping a friend rebuild an orphanage. Almost every person I met was a religious aid worker. I remember going to the market in Haiti and I met this man, and I said to him, “What are you doing here?” And he said, “Well, I’m a Mennonite, and I and my group are building homes in the rural areas outside of Port-au-Prince.” So I said, “Why are you doing this?” He said, “Well, I’ve been here for about five or six years, and I came because my son was sent by the church community 20 years ago. And after 15 years of watching my son do this, I thought it’s time for me to go.” This story could be duplicated again and again and again. And, in fact, if tomorrow you took religion out of the world, the world would be tremendously impoverished in terms of the way in which people who are in trouble get help. Evangelical organizations were the first ones on the ground after the tsunami in Indonesia, and that story could be repeated again and again throughout the world. That’s point one. Here’s point two. The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Health is about to come out in 2012, the Second Edition. In case you won’t find the time to read it, I’m now going to save you the time. This is a handbook that anthologizes over 3,000 studies from the New England Journal of Medicine, JAMA, Lancet, all peer-review journals that are not particularly sympathetic to religion. And this is what it says. Religious Americans give more to charity, volunteer more, participate in civic processes more, attend more meetings, are more likely to vote, to volunteer, less likely to drink, divorce, do drugs. They are much more inclined to be optimistic and feel meaningful about life. They’re less inclined to depression, less inclined to suicide, less inclined to suicidal thoughts. They are much more helpful in their communities. If you want to measure altruism and empathy, the best measure is not age, gender, income, education. It’s whether you’re involved in a religious community. I’ll give you one study at the University of Miami. They studied people who’d been diagnosed with AIDS, whether they turned to religion or away from religion. Those who turned to religion, several months later, had lower viral loads, lower CD4 counts. They were healthier than those who didn’t. In fact, religion, if you’re part of a religious community as measured by attending services and reading Scripture and praying, it adds on average seven years to your life if you’re a white American male, 14 years if you’re an African American male. Now, the dean of this research, Harold Koenig at Duke University says that he has to point out to you that you may spend those seven years in church, but nonetheless, you have to decide what you want to do with the time. Still, you have the time to do it. All of this is a way of emphasizing that religion and being part of a religious community does enormous good. I see it day after day, week after week. The little nameless, unremembered acts of kindness and of love about which Wordsworth wrote, that’s what religious people do and in part because it’s a system that encourages goodness, which is why when a religious person does something wrong, people get particular upset. “How can he do this?” He’s supposed to be religious. Every time someone complains about the synagogue, the call begins as follows: “How, in a synagogue, could you…” which is a way of saying you’re supposed to aspire to be better. And that’s exactly right. Mother Teresa was once tending to the wounds of a leper in Calcutta. And wiping the separating wounds from this sick and dying person. And a journalist who'd been following her around for several days said to her, ""I wouldn't do that for a million dollars."" And without looking up, she said, ""Neither would I."" It's true. Many people of all different beliefs and no beliefs do good in this world. But if you want to find an organized system that encourages people to be better, to transcend themselves, that seeks to make the world colorful, kind, compassionate, giving, good, a system that often fails but at least aspires to that, not in little enclaves of this class or this school, but worldwide, consistently, the only one we have ever had is religion. The world without it would be a poorer, sadder and crueler place. Thank you.Thank you, David Wolpe. And here's where we are. We are halfway through the opening round of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate. I'm John Donvan of ABC News. We have four debaters, two teams of two, fighting it out over this motion, ""The world would be better off without religion.""We've heard from the first two speakers, and now onto the third. Speaking for the motion, Matthew Chapman. He is a writer and cofounder and president of Science Debate, and in a sense is our real renaissance man tonight. You've also directed films, written books, written magazine articles. You were particularly fascinated by a case I also covered of the Dover School Board wanting to push back against the theory of evolution. And you wrote extensively about that. Of course, you do have some vested interest in your-- it's on your mother's side, your great-great-grandfather?My great-great-grandfather on my mother's side, yes.All right. So you have some sparkling DNA walking around tonight as you come to this argument. Ladies and gentlemen, Matthew Chapman.Thank you. I am not a professional like these guys, so I'm going to read my notes. I apologize. Religion makes two big claims: God really exists, and religion makes us behave better. But does religion make us behave better? To partially answer that question, let me read you a verse or two from the Bible. Deuteronomy, Chapter 25, Verses 11 and 12. ""When men strive together one with another, and the wife of the one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth him and putteth forth a hand and taketh him by the secrets, then shalt thou cut off her hand."" Roughly translated, this means that if you're in a fight, and your wife tries to help you by grabbing your opponent's balls, you should chop her hand off. It's there. I mean, I can show you. I know it's kind of cheap to poke fun at the Bible because it's so easy, but-- but there is-- there is a serious point here, which is that far from making us behave better, religion often complicates and distorts morality. By any reasonable standards, hacking bits off your wife is far worse than her squeezing your enemy's nuts. The thing is that in almost any holy book, you can find something that will validate just about anything. And afterwards, you don't have to defend the humanity of your actions or take responsibility because God told you to do it. Believe it or not, there's more atheism up here than faith. A.C. Grayling and I are atheists. David and Dinesh are too, except when it comes to their own religion. Every other religion, they're atheist about. This is why religion is divisive. Everyone on earth wants food, water, shelter, love, for their children to grow up to be happy and in a peaceful world. These common desires are so profound they ought to make war an absurdity, a violence against self. Religion, however, makes everyone an infidel to someone. But we're no longer ignorant, isolated tribes who think the earth is flat and don't know what lies around the corner. We have photographs of our planet from space. And most of us have met people of many races. We know our world and who we share it with. And we also know that critical worldwide problems will require worldwide unity. In this context, religion's continuing assistance, insistence that my God is better than yours is disastrous, which leads me to credulity. There are literally thousands of gods available. Which one you believe in is really just an accident of birth. If David and Dinesh had been born in Afghanistan, they'd both be Muslim probably. Or they'd be dead. Like most people-- like most believers, however, they have faith in their inherited gods. They haven't tested the rest because there's far too many of them. How then do they know that their god exists and the other gods don't or that their god is better than the other gods? Because they've been told by an authority figure. And here's how he did it. He said, our God is supreme, but he's invisible. We have no proof he exists. But if you have faith, if you make a big effort to believe in him, you will believe in him. It's fantastic. They take the weakest point of the argument and make it a condition of entry so you overlook it. But if, in the most important area of your life, your philosophy no less, the first thing you learn as a child is that faith is absolutely essential, and evidence absolutely isn't, how can this not affect the way you think about everything? You've been brain washed to be credulous and submissive to authority. This affects many aspects of life, including the functioning of democracy and the understanding of science, both of which demand that you insist on evidence, question everything and take nothing on faith from anyone. Here's an example. Evolution through natural selection over billions of years is one of the best supported theories in science. But 40 to 50 percent of Americans believe the earth is only six to 8,000 years old and that God made us as we are now. Nearly 50 percent-- I mean, it's really extraordinary. It's unheard of in any other culture except Muslim countries. I've written widely on this subject and met creationists of all types. Often, they have-- I'd say usually they have no idea what evolution is. But they dispute it with passion from a religious standpoint, faith over reason. Evidence infuriates them, as does science itself. And this antipathy to science has slowed down stem cell research, continues to harm the health of women and girls and contributes to cynicism about scientific issues like global warming. But none of this captures the human suffering caused by religion. I grew up next to my gay uncle and his partner. When I was nine, I discovered they faced long prison sentences if their homosexuality was revealed. This was justified by Leviticus 20:13. And the verse was often quoted by both politicians and the clergy. ""If a man lieth with a man as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination. They shall surely be put to death."" This barbaric verse is still used by Christians, including Catholics and evangelicals. And violence is only its most obvious consequence. I end where I began. Religion claims to provide morality. But as can be seen in its divisiveness, its homophobia and in its almost universal subjugation of women, it just as often deforms morality. The question isn't whether religion can sometimes do good. Of course it can and has. The question is, can we come up with something better that does not depend on dangerous and childish faith and thousands of competing gods? Can we persuade people that it's possible to live a good, peaceful and happy life guided only by human conscience and modern knowledge? When people who believe in martyrdom and an afterlife will soon get weapons of mass destruction, I think we have to, that we can and that we will. And that's why I ask you to support the motion that ""the world would be better off without religion."" Thank you.Thank you, Matthew Chapman. This is our motion, ""The world would be better off without religion."" And now here to speak against the motion, Dinesh D'Souza. He's the president of the King's College. He is a leading conservative thinker in the country from a very young age, starting in his college years. As a young man also, he was an advisor to President Reagan. You've also written a lot of books. Now, your opponent has written three times as many books as you. But I hate to tell you, Anthony, that Dinesh has written about five times as many best sellers as you have. So I think you trump on that. Ladies and gentlemen, Dinesh D'Souza.Thank you. It's my peculiar fate in this debate to be speaking last and therefore to have to digest the statements of the other speakers. I must say this puts me an odd position. I feel a bit like the mosquito in a nudist colony. I'm not sure where to begin. I guess I'll begin by noting that there were two definitions that have been advanced by the other side that actually I think help our case. The first one is the idea that people who have religious beliefs are hypocritical. But notice that in making this accusation what was being alleged is that religious believers have ideals higher than they can live up to. And this is advanced as hypocrisy, in other words, holding up to a standard and falling short of it. Now, that is actually not hypocrisy. If you read the Bible, Jesus doesn't call people hypocrites because their ideals are too high. He calls people hypocrites who pretend to be one thing and are really another. The problem with the Pharisees wasn't that they had high principles, is that they didn't have principles but they pretended to be something they weren't, so we've seen a subtle shift in the meaning of hypocrisy, a shift that is advanced by the atheist side, why? To basically pull down the moral ideals that we hold up that are higher than ourselves. That I would suggest is a very bad thing. Now, Matthew made the argument that religion is a function of where you're born. If you were born in India, you're going to be a Hindu-- actually I was born in India, I was raised Catholic, but never mind-- that your religious identity is formed as a result of where you're born. If you're born in Afghanistan you're a Muslim and so on. Well I think this applies to all our beliefs. Let's say for example that somebody born in Oxford, England is more likely to subscribe to the theory of evolution than someone born in Oxford, Mississippi. Somebody who is born in New York City is more likely to have formed Einstein's theory of relativity than someone born in New Guinea. Now what does that say about whether evolution and relativity are true? Nothing. The fact of your birth is irrelevant to the merit of the idea, so there's a kind of sleight of hand here, you have to judge the ideas by their own merits. Now, would the world be better without religion? You can't answer that question without looking to see what religion has done in the world, but you've got to compare it to what the world would be like without religion. There's been some allusion to the boring crimes of religion, but let me suggest that those crimes, even the worst of them, are infinitesimal compared to the crimes of atheist regimes that are far greater in magnitude, far longer in duration, and actually are still going on. If you consider, for example, a tragedy like the inquisition, a crime, I admit it, and yet over 400 years the Spanish Inquisition killed fewer than 2,000 people, 2,000. The Salem Witch Trials I heard about when I came to America, and then my wife and I a few years ago went to Salem, Massachusetts, it's a really interesting place-- I do want to report, the witches today are doing great, most of them are tourist guides-- but if you pick up one of their brochures, the number of people killed in the Salem Witch Trials, 19, 19. Now, is that 19 too many? Yeah, or if you want to add it up, 2,019. But while the atheists cry inconsolable crocodile tears over the crimes of religion, they ignore the vastly greater crimes of atheism. Now, am I talking about Stalin in Russia and Mao in China? Not even really, that's just the tip of the atheist iceberg. If you dig deeper, there is a massive procession underneath. In the Soviet Union alone, starting with Lenin you continue through Brezhnev, Andropov, Chernenko, a procession of Soviet dictators, but what about Ceausescu and Fidel Castro, Kim Jong Il, Pol Pot, I mean, Pol Pot is such a junior league atheist people don't even mention him. And yet in the aftermath of the Vietnam War, his Khmer Rouge regime in the space of about three years managed to kill two million people, two million. Even bin Laden in his wildest dreams has not even come close, but who should parachute into the discussion at this critical moment but Richard Dawkins in his book, ""The God Delusion,"" and he goes, ""Wait a minute. We've got to make a crucial distinction here.""You might've had some tyrants who killed-- who happened to be atheist, but they didn't kill in the name of atheism. The Christians killed in the name of Christianity. Now, Richard Dawkins is a respected biologist, and I think here you begin to see the problem, when a biologist is allowed to leave the laboratory. Why? Because evidently the poor man knows no history, all you have to do is crack open the collected works of Karl Marx, and you will see that the atheism is not incidental, it's not some add on, it's intrinsic to the whole ideological scheme, Marx famously calls religion, the opium, a kind of drug of the masses. And his point is you’ve got to get rid of religion in order to establish the new man and the new Utopia freed from the shackles of traditional religion and traditional morality. Often when we think of secular society, we think of Europe. But Europe isn’t really secular. Europe is a product of 2,000 years of Jewish and Christian civilization. Even today if there’s a famine in Rwanda, while much of the world ignores it, the European countries, the Western countries begin to send to food and aid, Doctors without Borders, the Red Cross. My point is this is the result of a religious training and a religious habit of mind that remains. Nietzsche once said that if we get rid of God, we’ve got to get rid of shadows of God. In other words, the ideas that Judaism and Christianity brought into the West and into the world, those will begin to erode as well. Dostoevsky said a long time ago, “If God is not, everything is permitted.” And Dostoevsky’s point is that when we get rid of transcendence, when we create a world without religion, we license terrible calamities. So, in the names of the thousands and hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of souls who have died, I would say from their point of view, the world would have been a lot better off if it had religion. Thank you.Thank you, Dinesh D’Souza. And that concludes round one, opening statements of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate. We’ll be right back. Okay, so we’re going to do one of our spontaneous bursts of applause by you. To begin our second round, I just want to allow the crew to remove the lecterns. All right. Let’s all clap. Our motion is “The world would be better off without religion.” This is a debate from Intelligence Square U.S. We’re at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University. I’m John Donvan. We have two teams of two arguing out this motion. One team, A.C. Grayling, Anthony Grayling and Matthew Chapman, arguing the world would be better off without religion. They make the argument that religion has been a burden for mankind, that it imprisons the minds of those who participate in it, keeping them within a narrow range of ideas, discouraged from thinking, believing in things that they say are evidentially not evidential, that are not real, also that religion divides us historically in ways that have had terrible consequences. The team arguing against the motion that the world would be better off without religion, who are saying explicitly the world would be better off-- is better off with religion, Dinesh D’Souza and Rabbi David Wolpe. They are arguing that a world without religion would be a very, very bleak place, in part because of the absence of the sorts of goods that manifestly are carried out in the name of religion around the world, and that in places where godlessness has been established, terrible things, terrible crimes have been committed in the name of godlessness, or, more accurately, in the absence of the name of God. We’re going to go onto round two now. This is the round where the debaters address one another and also take questions from me and from you in the audience. We’re going to revisit some of what’s been said already and also get into some new areas. And I want to start with the side arguing for the motion, the side that’s arguing that we would be better off without religion. What does it say about the many billions of humans who embrace religion that they do so given your argument that it is destructive to them and that it is limiting to them and that there is a delusion in it? What do you say about them? Why are they doing that? Anthony Grayling.Well, first, of course, Matthew is right to point out that the religion that anybody has, tends, on the whole-- in much more than 95 percent of cases to be the religion of your parents. And so, it’s a traditional thing. People are brought up in the religion of their father, and it’s historical.Can I just want to ask you to go closer to the microphone-- and you can address the answer out to the audience. It doesn’t just have to be in my direction. And if you could start again.But you asked me the question.I know that. But know that my eyes are boring into the side of your head.Okay, so I repeat the answer, which is, of course, religion is pervasive in history at its traditional-- it’s handed down from parents to their children so it remains the case that it’s a very potent force in society. But if you look at the trend in the developed and advanced and educated countries of the world, mainly the Western countries, since the 17th and 18th century, enlightenment and the growth of science, you see the numbers are plummeting. They are plummeting even here in the United States of America. You look at the few polling data and it points out to us that the number of people who self- identify as not having a religious commitment or agnostic or atheist is increasing all the time, especially among the young. So the trends are setting in the right direction.All right. Let me take that to the other side. And in the argument made by Anthony Grayling and also earlier by Matthew Chapman is that that religion kind of gets kids early when they'll believe anything. And then it's set. And then it's set and hard to move off. And I want you to take that point on.Sure. Remember, we also get kids early with habits like brushing your teeth, learning the mathematical tables. Now, here is the point. I think that as a practical matter, we all learn our ethical values from our parents. I learned what I would call “crayon Christianity” from my parents. But the fact of the matter is that's my parents' beliefs. When I became a teenager, when I went to Dartmouth, that set of beliefs got battered, and crayon Christianity became no Christianity at all. So it was in adult life that I had to go back to the ideas that had been bred in me as a child and ask, which of my parents' beliefs do I agree with?But do you think you're typical? You're--I do.You went to Dartmouth. You're a very bright guy.Well--And brushing your teeth, those are scientific experiments that have determined-- but they're arguing a somewhat different point, that there are lots of people who may not be able to do the critical thinking that you do.Well, I think we're making a deep mistake here because just to say we learned it from our parents misses the thrust of why billions of people in the world continue to do it long into old age. In other words, religion delivers practical benefits. It gives us the hope of life after death. You might say that's an illusion, but you don't know. None of us knows what comes after death. We all have to die in any case. Either we die with despair facing annihilation, or we have the hope of something else. That's a practical benefit. Second, religion is a mode of transmission of morality. You might say there is morality that comes through Kant or Nietzsche or Heidegger. But no one teaches their kids morality that way. People learn their morality--All right. Dinesh, let me bring it over to Matthew Chapman and bring him into this. And if you can respond to some of what you've heard here.Well, I just think it's a distortion of what you actually see in life, which is you see people who grow up in cultures. They become addicted to their particular religions. They disagree with all kinds of other religions. Even you, you started as a Catholic. You end up as an evangelical. Does that mean that you then say the stuff in the Catholic part of it was actually wrong, and you were mistaken about that? I think all of this is frankly delusional and that even if you could remove all of the bad things about religion and keep all of the good things in religion, none of which can't be performed by people who don't believe in God because they can. But even if you could remove all of the bad things from religion, and you ended up with a character who is like Father Christmas, a nice harmless sort of person, would you want to find out that the president of the United States was a devout believer in Father Christmas? Not me.All right, let me take this-- Let me take this to-- I want to take it to David Wolpe because the issue of whether there's a credulity here that people believe suggests that people's minds aren't growing.So I want to say, first of all, it's so interesting that the side that's quoting the Bible is that side and the side that has actually provided evidence of any kind is this side. So let me give you another piece of evidence as opposed to the generalities. In their Encyclopedia of Wars, okay, the Encyclopedia of Wars, Charles Phillips and Alan Axelrod, they chronicle over 1700 serious conflicts throughout history. Do you want to know what percentage actually reduced to religious wars? Seven percent.David, David, I--The reason I'm saying this is because it's not about credulity. No, it's not about credulity. The idea that people who are religious are religious because of some psychological deficit, but people who are not religious are not religious because they reason their way to the lack of religion, not only slights the idea that religious people are capable of thought, but also tries to sort of railroad into this belief that you should condemn it without actually looking at all the statistics, the ideas, the history that we cited. And that sort of slighting of the religious belief makes me think that your argument might not be as sound as you think it is.A.C. Grayling.Can I come back to that? I hear a certain kind of incoherence on the other side there. Firstly, if you're religious, you live longer, that puzzles me. I mean, isn't heaven meant to be a nice place? It's always been--Moses was like 800 years old or something like that.Yeah. And then Dinesh says that one reason why people stay religious into old age is because they're thinking about life after death. Well, that was Bernie Madoff's mistake. He promised returns in this life. So you know, religion. I'm afraid the things that most people are brought up in a religious tradition, and those people who escape religion do it because they look at the facts, they look at the evidence, they look at the morality. They look at the teachings. They look at the world around them, and they recognize that there is something very divisive and very distorting here. Look at small children even in kindergarten, all races and ethnicities and backgrounds and classes and religions. They don't know that. We have to work very, very hard to divide them and tell them what tribe they belong to and what religion they belong to. And that's where the source of the trouble comes in our world--All right, Dinesh D'Souza.--from division.Dinesh D'Souza to respond.A.C. said earlier that the defining feature of religion is hierarchy and exclusivity. And I think that on both these, he's giving a very narrow and ethno-centric definition. First of all, Christianity is the only religion in the world that considers another religion, Judaism, to be wholly true. Hinduism considers all other religions to be wholly true. There's no sense in the Eastern religions of this hierarchy of this exclusivity. So we're seeing here not an attack on religion, but on a very slice of religion, perhaps fundamentalist religion. I think the deeper point here is this: And that is that the religious guy and the nonreligious guy are both responding to the world as it is. Charles Darwin became an atheist not because he discovered evolution. It wasn't facts. It was when his daughter, Annie, died. And Charles Darwin said, ""If there's a hell, lots of the lovely people I know would be in it. I can't bear that kind of a doctrine."" You, Matthew, in your article in Slate magazine talked about nuns or teachers who beat you on the ankles and people-- people who stuck their hands down your pants. My point is, in many cases, we're not dealing with facts. We're dealing with wounded theism. Many times when we heard the word ""atheism,"" we're dealing with a person who is angry with God or angry maybe with the representative, the self-appointed representative of God. That's not real atheism. They too are conducting, if you will, an ideological war, otherwise they wouldn't--All right.--be here.That's an interesting point. Matthew Chapman, are you angry with God?How can you be angry with somebody that doesn't exist? I'm angry with Dinesh because he's making these preposterous statements about my--Well, I didn't put my hand down your pants.--great-great-grandfather-- that are simply not true. His atheism didn't come solely from the fact that his daughter died. It was a very slow process of seeing how the theory of evolution was in conflict with the Bible. And I think the point I would make is, let's give the religious people that at some point in history, religion was helpful, that it did make people do better things. But that the texts that the religions are based upon are archaic, absurd, cruel, open to interpretation. And frankly, there are better ways of conducting yourself in life. There are. And people like myself and Anthony here, we don't find a problem with being moral without God.All right.And I don't buy in argument that we've inherited it from Christianity because if you look at the sort of evolutionary world, empathy and cooperation, compassion clearly existed before God decided, for some unknown reason,Let me take it to David Wolpe to talk about this question of the text. And you're in an interesting position because in 2001 you gave a talk in which you actually questioned the literal truth of the exodus story. So you are not-- you are already not tied--I'm not a literalist, no. But what I find very interesting is that the leap that Matthew's making-- he says these texts have cruel things. There are better ways to behalf. But we're asking not would the world be better off if you rewrote the Bible, but would the world be better off without the influence that religion has on religious people. And I tried again and again to say this is what religious people do. This is what religious people do. This is what religious people do only to get back, ""But look at the terrible text."" And I want to say, in response to what Anthony said, I have the exact opposite experience. I actually think that if you believe that people are fundamentally good, and if you leave them alone, they're just going to be good, then you've never visited a playground, because my experience is when a new kid comes to the playground, the other kids don't go, ""Oh, look, a new child. Let us embrace him and share our toys."" Actually, children have to be socialized to good. They do. And it takes a lot of work. If any of you are parents, do you have to tell your kid, ""Don't share so much, don't be so nice."" No, quite the opposite. And that work is difficult work and constant work and that's what religious communities do. Do they ever do harm? Of course they sometimes do harm. Are there texts I don't like? Of course, but the coda to this is, this idea that religious people are thoughtless automatons that follow what the text says, does violence to everything I know about religious training, about religious leaders, about religious people, and by the way about the fact that we're having a debate like this tonight.Let me go to the other--I would like to----all right, very quickly.--because I think what he's saying is this is the viewpoint of a rabbi who does work in an affluent community in Los Angeles. Both these men are very sophisticated. The people I met in Pennsylvania, who 50 percent of them believe in creationism and are fundamentalists, are people-- these people, they ignore. They're saying we ignore their sophistication. I'm saying they ignore the fact that most of the world is fundamentalist and takes a barbaric view of many of the text.And if there were no religion, what would be happening in Pennsylvania? In other words, what's the harm in the Pennsylvania situation, where the school board wanted intelligent design taught as an equal alternative to evolution, you've got to specify what the harm is there.Well, the harm is absolutely enormous, I mean, 50 percent-- I mean, just to be practical about it-- 50 percent of the growth of the American economy since World War II has come from science and technology. And this anti-scientism is gradually eroding America's ability to produce enterprising, educated--Okay, I want-- that's a new point that I want to take to this side, the argument that religious thinking and religious strictures limit science, Galileo into the future. Go ahead. Dinesh D'Souza.First of all, if you want to make a list of the 200 greatest scientists of all time from Newton, Copernicus, Kepler, Pascal, Gassindi, Boyle, the list goes on, you find that the vast, vast majority of them were religious believers. Moreover, it's not an accident that science did not develop universally. It developed in Western civilization. Why is that? Because in Western civilization, there is an embedded religious idea, and that is the idea of the rational cosmos. The Muslim philosopher Al-Ghazali denies that the universe operates by laws. He says, ""Everything happens because Allah wills it at every given moment,"" that's why science didn't develop in the Muslim world. It's the sense of the whimsical, the miraculous universe. The point I'm trying to get at here is that on the basis of, I would say, a one percent minority of religious rednecks, we have an indictment of all the world's religions as a whole.Right.Nothing could be more crude and shameful than to imply that Athens and Jerusalem which have given rise to Western civilization, that have shaped our philosophy, our economy, separation of powers, checks, and balances, when Thomas Jefferson, who--All right, Dinesh, I want to cut you off to let Anthony Grayling--Yeah, sorry, I mean there are two things, Dinesh, with great respect to you, you are the most tremendous rewriter of history I've ever come across in my life. You don't seem to be conscious of the fact that when Christianity became dominant in Europe in about the third, fourth century A.D. it looked at its sundial, the perusing of the second coming of the Messiah hadn't happened, they needed some extra ethics. The ethics of the New Testament and the Napoleon epistles are very thin, they're the stuff I talked about earlier, give everything away, don't get married, don't bother about tomorrow. Where did they get it from? They got it from Greek philosophy. Most of European culture, and that means culture of the West, is deeply rooted in classical antiquity, in the thinking of Socrates, and Aristotle, and the stoics. That is where our European outlook-- our cultural outlook comes from. Conceptions of justice, of ethics, of a democracy, they all come from the pre-Christian state of Europe. Christianity was an oriental religion that erupted into Europe and changed the course of European history, and derailed it for over 1,000 years. People couldn't build a dome like the Dome of Maxentius in Rome because they'd lost the understanding of simple engineering. Wasn't until Brunelleschi's Dome in Florence in the 15-- 16th century that that was possible. So we're looking at a phenomenon here where religion did to our forefathers, did to the history of our culture exactly what Matthew says it's doing again to the prospects for science and progress in our contemporary world.All right. David Wolpe.Very briefly, Anthony, I think actually you're the victim of a very parochial education because long before Christianity, Judaism enunciated all the ideals that you say did not actually come from religion. In 50 BCE, when Hillel was asked to summarize all of Judaism, he said that which is hateful to you, don't do to others. And the sages of Judaism were killed by the Roman Empire, not be a religious empire, as opposed to Socrates who was killed by the Athenian polity that you idealize. They killed their own sages. In Judaism, we venerated them. And they’re actually the ones who ceded Christianity and gave us the morality that you claim came from the Stoics.Anthony.Can I tell David just a quick little anecdote about a conversation I had with a cab driver in London. Cab drivers in London are very interesting folk. I asked this man if he’d read the Old Testament. He said he hadn’t. I said, “Do you remember any stories from the Old Testament.” He thought for a moment. He said, “Yep, I remember something about a woman being turned into a pillar of salt,” and I took this to be evidence of some domestic disorder in his own family and wishful thinking. I said to him, “Do you remember that story, you know, God didn’t like the homosexuals in Sodom so he was going to destroy everybody there? Somebody pointed out to him that there might be a righteous person. He sent the angels to tell Lot to get out of the city. The citizens wanted those two angels, the handsome young men. And Lot said to them, ‘You can have my daughters instead.’ When they finally left the city, what happened to his two daughters?”They didn’t have husbands, so they slept with their father and became the--All right, we see where you're going.I know the story. By the way, actually you also are the victim of an inadequate Biblical education I think because Sodom was not destroyed because of homosexuality. Read the book of Ezekiel. It was destroyed because of the cruelty of the people of Sodom, their immorality, and I really-- I think with all due respect that to cite London cab drivers, pithy though they may be as the demonstration that Judaism didn’t actually create the morality of the West, may be a little thin.the demonstration. And Sodom was destroyed no matter what reason you give to it.I want to go to questions from the audience. I want to move onto your questions and recall that I’d like you to be very terse and to really ask a question that’s on our motion that moves it forward. Before we get to it, get all ready for that, I just want to take one - - move things in one more direction, to this thought. I want to rephrase what David Wolpe has been saying, is that religion organizes-- religion has the capacity to organize the best in us, to do good things, and to transcend ourselves. And what he paints is a bleak world without that. So, it’s undeniable in places like Africa, et cetera, that the enormous amount of work is done through organized religion. And that’s on everybody’s mind, so I’d like you to take that on.Well, we can share it. But most people are religious, so it’s not surprising that most people who are out there doing good things are religious. It’s the same argument I would make about scientists. Most scientists were Christians. Well, most everybody was Christian. So, of course, most of the scientists were Christians.So you’re saying there’s no cause and effect between--I don’t think so. There’s lots and lots of people who do good things and organize--I’ll challenge that on the basis of this book right here by the sociologist Arthur Brooks. It’s called “Who Really Cares?” And it’s the careful study of philanthropy in America. So it’s comparing like with like. It divides America into four groups: religious conservatives, religious liberals, secular conservatives, and secular liberals. And it looks at generosity, not just in terms of money, but also in terms of time, and not to religious causes but to so-called secular causes. Turns out that the most charitable people in America, by far, are the religious conservatives. The second most charitable are the religious liberals. The third most charitable are the secular conservatives, and the last are the secular liberals. Now, what’s particularly poignant about this is the secular liberals in America are the richest. They earn the most money, but they give away the least. So it is not the case that this is a generic matter of people who happen to be religious. The point which David Sloan Wilson made in a recent book is that evolution narrows the circle of our sympathies to our kin or to people from whom we can get something. But when you do things in service to God, you’re much more likely to help the stranger or the outsider.All right. A very quick response from the other side if you want, Anthony Grayling.Okay, I just want to make the point that there are plenty of non-religious people involved in charitable endeavors and they don’t stay on afterwards because they don’t have an extra agenda. And I just want to quote to you--You mean proselytization?Yeah exactly. And I don’t-- I just want to--Anthony, can you be explicit about that.Yes, sir, because I don’t think that they’re staying on because they haven’t got anything to proselytize about. They don’t want a return for their investment. George Bernard Shaw said-- very, very quick quote-- he said when he gave up religion-- escaped religion as a teenager, he said that moment was the moment when I felt the dawning of moral passion because people who don’t take a box out of the frozen food warehouse of morality, you know, there it all is, are people who have go to think about their responsibilities and about their relationships to other people. They've got to be people who think about the diversity, how different people are from one another. You know the golden rule, ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,"" George Bernard Shaw said, no, under no circumstances should you do to others what you'd like them to do to you because they may not like it. And that's a very good insight. It means see them for what they are in their individuality and personality and base your morality on a genuine understanding of what it is to be human in a human world.All right. I'm going to go to questions. And if I turn down your question, please don't take it personally. It'd just be my judgment that it might not be on point. Right in the middle there, yeah. Yeah. You just pointed to yourself. And if you could stand up and tell us your name.Hi. My name is Elizabeth, and my question to those who are for the motion is, how are the harms of religion different from those of nationalism or racism? And for those against the motion, how are the good things from religion different from the good things that come from secular charities or community organizations or--Okay.--being involved with your family?Okay. I'm going to-- good questions, which are really one question that I think we all see. And I will let this side go first. This side for the motion. Matthew Chapman.Well, I think the difference is that even the mistakes of people who are acting out of nonreligious motives are mistakes based on reason. And that most of the horrors of religion are mistakes based out of superstitious fear and delusion. And I cannot see how delusion can be healthy to a society. I just can't-- I can't see it. Not all of these religions can be true because they all contradict each other. So some of them are delusional. How can this be healthy? It's divisive. It's nonsensical. And I am not saying that atheism has come up with the perfect solution. But there has to be a better way than this.Do you know what it is?I think it's secular humanism. It's atheism.Okay. All right. David Wolpe, do you want to respond? You can either respond to what's just been said or to the question which was a variation.I mean, the frustration that I repeatedly am having in this debate is that we're arguing theory against the world. The world is that there are millions and millions and millions of people who, by their own testimony, although the other side may not believe it, say they're doing good because they believe there is a transcendent purpose in their doing good. Therefore, they'll do it tomorrow, next week, next month, next year. It's not a club that's going to dissolve. They're not going to go away. They're not going to stop doing it. And they're going to teach their children to do it. And what we hear on the other side, to a great extent is, that's bad because it's delusional. And the question is not actually would the world be better off if everybody had the same scientific ideology? Would that be a better world? The world-- the question is, what would it be like if religion were gone? What would it be if you just, all of a sudden, sucked that motivation from these countless people who do good? And that's what I want to know.I'd like to propose an--Matthew Chapman.--experiment, if I may, which is I would ask the audience, how many of you out there do good things, do charity, visit people in hospitals, take care of friends? And could I see a show of hands of anyone who's involved in charitable endeavors, helping people, taking care of animals, giving money to charity, whatever it is.I hope the rapture happens right now because--There we have----I'm going to know who's telling the truth.Now-- now I would like to see a show of hands of how many of those people did that because they feared religion or religious authority.Feared?Well, or were-- or were--Here's-- here's my question.Okay. I haven't-- no, I haven't-- I haven't finished yet.Hold on for a second, David.I haven't finished yet.Okay.Or-- I mean, we saw no hands there, or who did it because they thought that by doing good action it would get them into heaven. Let's see a show of hand on that.Didn't say that, either.Now--David, David, David--Now let's see a show of hands from people who do these good things simply because they have a human empathy towards people who are suffering.I think we have a biased pollster here in the audience, you know.I don't think so. I mean--All right. We get it.--people do good things--Let David respond to that. David Wolpe.--for other reasons than religion--Matthew, let David come back.--the majority here.The reason that that's not persuasive, shall we say, is first of all, very few religious people will tell you it's to get into heaven. It's because it's what God expects them to do. That's first of all. In other words, you do it because other human beings are created in the image of God. And if you take that out, then our link is a species link. But if we're all children of the same God, then you are my brother and sister, and that's why you do it. It's different. It's not because you are afraid of God. And second, people's self- reported charitable doings, although obviously everyone here is completely honest. People's self-reported charitable doings are a lot less reliable than survey after survey after survey. And the way that the surveys were answered by Putnam, by Brooks, by Koenig, by respected sociologists, the way that he answered them is by asking you to raise your hand. Now, I want to ask you seriously, how many of you believe that all these sociologists and psychologists are cooking the data, and how many-- you don't have to raise your hand. And how many of you believe that whether you like religion or not, the truth is that it does make people much more inclined to be self-sacrificing in this world. And if you don't believe it, then all I can say is, I know a world without religion that you can look at. I'm from that world. It's called Hollywood.All right. Let's go to another question. Right down in the front row there. No, the gentleman. You'll probably notice a male-female pattern in my selection, the next question you know who should raise their hands.Thank you so much for this evening. I think it's a great debate, and I truly enjoy it. I am Muslim, okay. So definitely, my question will go to you guys. Great point that you make, but I will make it quick. The thing is that religion is really the question for me today because is it the misuse of religion that's really bringing all this drama and all the chaos that we really talk about, or is it really religion itself? Because if I have a weapon, right, and I use it against you, and in this day today, we go to court, I will take the person on his character and take him to court and take him to jail, not the companies that make the weapons or the owner of the company. But I will take the person on his own act. So it could really--I think you started with the question.Okay.Which was, is it religion, or is it the way that some people are using it or misusing it? That's a terrific question. Let's go to this side. Matthew Chapman.Well, I mean, that, to me, is the entire problem. If you look at any religious text, it can be interpreted in any way and give you an excuse to do anything. These gentleman here, I'm sure they're very nice people, and they look at it in the most benign way. I've heard Rabbi Wolpe over there say that the whole process of religion is that you take all these complicated books, and you filter them through human consciousness and out comes something that makes sense. I agree. And when you filter them out, what you get is humanism. Jefferson did the same thing with the Bible. He took out everything that he thought was contemptible or had nothing to do with the origins of religion. He got 48 pages. I say you could bring it down to one page that said-- or one phrase which would be ""Do unto others as you do-- as you would have done to you."" It is as simple as that. And all of those texts--So Matthew, your answer to his--Your answer to his question is, it's not just how religion gets used. The problem is religion itself.The problem is the ancient texts that are infinitely interpretable for any purpose.Okay. Dinesh, do you have somewhere new to take this response?Well, yeah. First of all, Jefferson, who was a man of the enlightenment, not a very devout Christian, as you point out correctly. But when Jefferson was asked, ""What is the source of our rights?"" he could have said the social contract. He could have said the enlightenment. But no, he said it's the creator. He could think of only o","cornell-intelligence-squared-debates"
"obama-economic","We are starting and I would like to welcome our debaters onto the stage. Thank you for that warm welcome to our debaters and I’d like to also ask for a warm welcome for the chairman and founder of Intelligence Squared US, Robert Rosenkranz.Well, thank you all very much for joining us tonight, you know, the mission of Intelligence Squared, is to encourage our audience to consider both sides of contentious issues. To think twice about their positions. So one of our panelists tonight, former Governor Eliot Spitzer, has certainly done that. Just last week he thought twice about arguing in favor of tonight’s motion, and “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” decided to argue against it. When Obama took office, the financial sector had just been saved from collapse by massive government intervention. That collapse occurred against the backdrop of a relatively benign real economy, with decent growth and high employment. Then in the fourth quarter of ’08 and the first quarter of ’09, the real economy went into free fall. Economic output shrank, and unemployment rose at rates that we haven’t seen since the Great Depression. The collapse of the real economy could’ve been a death blow for an already weak financial sector. We were truly on the edge of an economic abyss, and fear itself was becoming a real self-fulfilling prophecy. Well the Obama administration threw every policy weapon it could at the problem. Zero interest rates, increased money supply, backstops for key financial institutions in the entire automotive industry, and a massive fiscal stimulus package. And confidence has clearly been restored. Businesses are building inventories, consumers are spending, investors are no longer hoarding cash. The stock market is up 19 percent since the beginning of the year, and corporate bonds are up nearly as much. Last quarter, we had 3.5 percent growth in the economy. It seems that the recession is over, and that Armageddon has been avoided. Is this not a picture of unalloyed success? Well, not so fast. Unemployment has increased to 10.5 percent. We bailed out the banks so that they could provide “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” credit to businesses and consumers, and instead they’re shrinking the loan portfolios. Government deficits are running in the trillions. Public debt has exploded, and the dollar is collapsing. We may eventually face a stark choice, between default, and inflation. And the private sector, the engine that has powered America’s economic dynamism, is facing the burden of higher tax rates, higher health care costs, carbon taxes, pro- union initiatives, pay czars and other intrusive regulation. With such powerful anti-growth forces in play, can we expect new jobs to put unemployed Americans back to work? Well, I’m not going to be the one to answer that question, but I will make a prediction. That tonight’s debate will be lively and informative, and it’s my pleasure to turn the evening over to John Donvan, and the outstanding panelists we have with us this evening.Thank you, Robert. Andmay I just invite one more round of applause for Robert Rosenkranz. Well, welcome, everybody, to another debate from Intelligence Squared US, I’m John Donvan of ABC News and once again it is my pleasure to serve as host and moderator, as the six debaters you see sharing the stage here with me at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University, three against three, will be debating this motion, “Obama’s Economic Policies Are Working Effectively.” Now, I want to point out this is a debate, “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” it’s a contest and although we have some professors on the panels they are not here to lecture, they are here to attack and defend but with ideas well-articulated and well-argued, and in this debate, you our live audience here at the Skirball Center, act as the judges. By the time the evening has ended, you will have voted twice, once before the debate begins and once again at the end, to tell us whether you agree or disagree with the motion. And at the end of the debate the team that has changed the most minds, will be declared our winner. Now, it is time to vote our preliminary vote, and if you go to the keypad on your left side…there’s a range of buttons from 1 to 10. Ignore all of them but 1, 2 and 3. If you push number 1 it means that you agree with the motion that “Obama’s Economic Policies Are Working Effectively.” Number 2 means that you disagree, and number 3 means that you’re undecided. And if you feel that you’ve pushed the buttons incorrectly, just repeat the correct entry and it will update to the current one. So it looks like everybody’s done that. And so our preliminary vote is in and let’s let the debate begin, Round 1, opening statements by each debater, seven minutes each. We begin with Mark Zandi who is an economist and the founder of Moody’s Economy.com. During the 2008 Presidential campaign he was an advisor to Senator John McCain, he has since become an advisor to the Obama White House, Mark, I’m not sure what that tells us about which side you’re on… “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” but the floor is yours—I’m an ecumenical economist, let’s put it that way. I want to thank Intelligence Squared for the opportunity to be here today, it’s certainly an honor to be here and to address such an important topic. I’m going to make three points in my opening remarks. Point number one. I think it’s really quite amazing the totality of the policy response from the administration, I think, we forget all the things that have been done to try to shore up the economy and we tend to focus on the one or two or three things that we’re most annoyed about, and we focus on that. Let me just spend a few minutes, well, I’ve got six minutes and 30 seconds, let me spend a couple minutes going over that. And there are three broad areas of policy effort here, first is the effort to shore up to the financial system, and this is everything from what the FDIC has done, increasing deposit insurance limits, to guaranteeing bank debt to allow the banks to issue to efforts by the Treasury to help facilitate all the things that the Federal Reserve Board has been doing to try to provide credit to the financial system and stabilize the financial system. Perhaps the most important thing in my mind with regard to the effort to shore up the financial system, was the banks’ stress tests--do you remember the stress test, this was done back earlier this year. And to me, those stress tests were the modern-day “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” equivalent of what FDR did back in the Great Depression, he— I’m going to exaggerate just a little bit but only a little bit. He closed all the banks on a Friday and he said on the subsequent Monday to his Treasury Secretary, open all of them except a couple hundred of them and the Treasury Secretary said to him, well, which ones should I open, and FDR said, well, it really doesn’t matter because the ones you open, everything will think are safe, and life will go on and— In fact it worked, it restored confidence and that was the beginning of the end of the Great Depression and the stress test in fact did that, it restored confidence and the financial system is stable. The second blotter of the policy response was to shore up the two weakest parts of our economy, the housing market and the auto market. I’m not going to spend much time on the auto market because Steve is so intimately involved in that great effort, and he’ll talk about that, but I know housing, and the efforts to shore up the housing market have been quite amazing, and just to name a few things. The first-time homebuyer tax credit, very important in stabilizing housing values this summer, to help to support buying by first-time home buyers, the loan modification plan to help homeowners who are facing foreclosure, to get their monthly mortgage payments down so that they can afford their, their mortgage payment. Efforts to provide more credit to the residential mortgage market through Fannie Mae and Freddie “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Mac and FHA. Here’s a statistic for you. 90 percent of all the residential mortgage loans being made today are being made by the federal government, so if the federal government wasn’t making those loans, the housing market would be in complete disarray and we’d be in very significant trouble, so the second broad policy effort was to help shore up those two key sectors, the two weakest sectors of our economy. And the third policy response, broadly speaking, is the fiscal stimulus, much maligned, but ultimately at the end of the day, very successful. I don’t think it’s any accident that the recession came to an end, at the same time that the stimulus was providing its maximum economic benefit to the economy. And the stimulus is lots of things, it’s aid to unemployed workers, it’s helped the state governments, it’s the first-time homebuyer tax credit, it’s Cash for Clunkers, a long list of things, the infrastructure spending, all very important. So, please remember, point number one, that the policy effort is a range of many things, it’s been incredibly— it’s amassing and incredibly unprecedented what has been done here, and key to bringing an end to this Great Recession. Point number two, here are the statistics I think are overwhelming. A year ago, think about a year ago, what was going on, major financial institutions were evaporating or being nationalized, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Lehman, Bear, AIG, Citigroup was on the doorstep of falling apart, and look at the situation today. “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” The financial system is not normal, no, but it is stable. And banks aren’t lending to us yet as business people and as consumers but they’re moving in that direction, and just imagine where we’d be today without that stability in the financial system. Think about the economic statistics, housing activity, new and existing single-family housing starts hit a low in January, housing construction hit a low in January, back at the beginning of the year, housing values were falling very rapidly, today, the last couple of quarters they’ve actually begun to increase. GDP, the value of all the things that we produce as an economy, grew 3.5 percent in the third quarter and the growth was very broad- based, that was the first substantive growth in over a year and a half. And clearly driving the economy forward, the GDP in the fourth quarter, the current quarter, is on track to be positive again. The job market. Last thing to improve, but it is improving, we’re moving in the right direction. We—just to give you a statistic, at the beginning of the year, we were losing 700,000 jobs on average every single month. In the last three months we lost 200,000 jobs a month, now I know, that’s a lot of jobs, unemployment is still rising. But the trend lines are right, they’re moving in the right direction and my view is by early next year, we will have a stable job market, and by the end of next year, we will have job growth that’s meaningful enough to bring down the rate of unemployment, so everything is moving in the “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” right direction. Finally, point number three, I said there were three points… The proposition is, “Obama’s Economic Policies Are Working Effectively.” It’s not, they have worked. This is not a mission accomplished, no one is arguing that this is over and done with, we have more work to do, and the administration is still working. Just last week, they passed another piece of legislation to help extend unemployment insurance benefits for people who lose their jobs in 2009, now if you become unemployed in 2009 you have 99 weeks of unemployment insurance benefits, they extended, and they expanded the first- time homebuyer tax credit into next year to provide support to the housing market, and they’ve provided a number of other supports. They are debating right now and will likely pass other efforts to shore up the economy, extend some of the other provisions in the stimulus to make sure that the stimulus provides benefit to the economy as we make our way into 2010. And more importantly and perhaps most importantly, we are working through some of the structural problems in our economy, working on the hard, difficult issues, the most obvious would be financial regulatory reform. Now this is something you don’t want to do quickly, you don’t want to make a mistake. Our financial regulatory structure has been in place since the Great Depression. It feels like it, and we have got to take time to make it right. So, in my view, what the administration has done has “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” been highly successful.Thank you, Mark Zandi. And I just want to point out the amazing virtuosity of Mark Zandi who was watching the clock the whole time, and he said “Thank you” as the clock that’s in front of us you can’t see, turned to zero. It’s just about perfect. Our motion is “Obama’s Economic Policies Are Working Effectively” and our first debater to argue against the motion, James Galbraith of the University of Texas, he generally argues from the left, he also has a rather scathing view of economists in the United States in general, he has said that, on all important policy issues, they are on the wrong side, himself an economist, James Galbraith.Thank you very much. The question before the house may appear political. But it in fact is not. One person on our panel as you’ve heard, shifted his position to argue our side. Two of us, supported President Obama in the last election and all three of us hope that he will succeed. The question is about the economy, it is about whether the economic program is working effectively. Lawrence Summers, the Chief Economic Advisor to the President, told the Washington Post on November 8th, quote, “I “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” think we got the Recovery Act right. The primary objective of our policy is having more work done, more product produced, and more people earning more income.” We agree with that standard. The economy is not performing up to that standard. Basically, if you leave aside the actions some of which Mark mentioned such as the extension of deposit insurance by the FDIC, that were taken under the Bush administration, the Obama economic program…the principal points are two. One is the Recovery Act, the stimulus bill, and the other is the policy of providing free reserves, credit at zero interest rate, to the banking system in the hopes that credit will flow again. So the question before us is, was the stimulus sufficient, and secondly, is credit flowing again. Now the stimulus did some good things, it helped forestall the complete collapse of budgets in the state and local government sector, it created some construction jobs and will create more. It has provided some tax relief. The question is, is it enough. I think it is pretty clear, that it was not enough. The stimulus was enacted based on a forecast that unemployment would not rise past about 8 percent by the middle of this year, would decline thereafter, that forecast was clearly wildly optimistic. It underestimated the state and local crisis where job cuts, or, just offsetting, the jobs created with federal funds. It did too little too late to meet the foreclosure crisis which is presently running at several million homes a year. Let me quote a distinguished “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” economist. On November 6th, 2009, he wrote, “After rising for more than two and a half years the country’s unemployment rate crossed into double-digit territory in October, with a jobless rate of 10.2 percent. This provides another sign of the severity of the current downturn, the very long road we face back to full employment, and the urgent need for more policy action to create jobs and protect those who can’t find work. With such a huge fire, we need every hose we can find to put it out.” I agree with that. There is an urgent need for more policy action. Who said it? Why, Larry Mishel, President of the Economic Policy Institute said it just 10 days ago. What you said… if you say this, that you also agree with Larry Summers, that the Recovery Act got it right. Now I am not an economic forecaster. But there are forecasters I greatly respect, and here is what one of them testified to Congress, on October 29th. “It is growing clear,” he said, “that more policy help will be needed to ensure that the tentative recovery evolves into a self-sustaining expansion. Although a double-dip downturn is less than likely, meaningful threats to the recovery still exist. Most notable, are the intensifying stresses in the job market, the ongoing foreclosure crisis, the boom and bust in the commercial real estate market the dysfunctional structured finance market and the fiscal woes of state and local governments.” Quite an impressive list and I hesitate to say this in a theater but it “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” sounds like other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how did you enjoy the play. To go on, “Congress must provide more resources to unemployed workers, whose benefits are running out, to state and local governments unable to balance their budgets and to household and businesses looking to buy homes and invest.” I agree with that. Congress must provide more resources. Who said it. Why, Mark Zandi said it, founder of Moody’s Economy.com, just two weeks ago. Would you say this, if you agreed with Larry Summers, that the Recovery Act got it right. Now it’s true, free money has saved the banks, everyone knows this, from their profit reports and their bonuses. The stock market has come back and so has the price of oil. Is this enough? We think not. We think the housing crisis is important, we think the collapse of small business is important, we think 10 percent unemployment as far as the eye can see is a disaster. We know as every business in America knows that credit is not flowing again. What would a working program look like. First it would dissolve rather than coddle the toxic banks. It would stop the displacement of people from their homes, not just slow it, not just help a few, but stop the displacement of people from their homes. It would help all their workers who are ready to leave their jobs, to retire by providing them with a more comfortable employment, and health care that they can count on at an earlier age than 65, opening up places for younger people who are “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” looking for jobs in today’s catastrophic labor market. And it would fund a lot of new green jobs, all across the country, providing every American who wants a chance to work, for the duration, until the private sector comes back, revives and is able to take up the slack. On our side, we don’t agree, on all of the issues. But on the issues just outlined and I submit they are the essential issues, the facts are plain. Better than nothing is not good enough. There was a poll…released just a few days ago on November 6th, which stated that 47 percent of Americans think that the economy is still the most important issue, that’s against all the other issues that might be considered. The American people know what this is about. They do not think that the program is working effectively, and that is surely telling. If it were working effectively, they would know. Thank you very much.Well….we just had another one of those one-second accomplishments. Next to argue for the motion, we asked the White House if they would provide a member of the administration to take part in the debate, they did not want to do that, but they suggested our next debater, Larry Mishel who is the president of the Economic Policy Institute, so Larry—I’m not saying you’re the White House’s guy. But, now everybody’s going “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” to think of you that way as as you get up, but the floor is yours.Well, I hope I get invited to the next official state dinner then— You know, as an economist, over my career I’ve been focused on what are the living standards of the American people, the working class. How they’ve done, and so what has mattered to me most on economic policy, is in fact, what have we done to create jobs, to get the unemployment rate down. And so I’m going to focus on the Recovery Act. And I’m here to say that I think it has actually been a bold and effective act. No, it has not solved all our economic problems. It has not solved the unemployment problem. That is not quite the standard that you should imagine, for judging whether the policies are effective. Let me just say—my imagery for all this. President Obama inherited a really large apartment building, it was all aflame, afire. He gathered all the fire trucks and hoses he could, and he put out the flames, in at least half the floors. But the critics say, look, there’s still fire and so your policies must be wrong. And especially, it turns out, these critics are the conservatives who actually lit the darn fire. And they tried to keep the fire hoses from actually getting to the fire building. I think it’s actually quite outrageous. Now it’s a somewhat different— I think it’s somewhat different to my “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” longtime, I don’t have any old friends, only have longtime friends, Jamie Galbraith. But we’ll get around to that. So let me talk at first about what the fire was. Mark talked about it. Over the nine months that included the last half of 2008 and the first three months of 2009, none of which were the responsibility of President Obama, okay, we had the fastest decline in the economy, basically since they started collecting the data in 1947 on a quarterly basis. We had already seen six million jobs lost by March 2009. The unemployment rate was already 8.5 percent, which is the highest it was since the great, really deep recession of the early 1980s. So we were in deep…you know what. And so we had the Recovery Act which was passed very quickly and effectively, actually started having some effect in March, but mostly started having an effect in April. And I want to go through exactly what it does, so it’s not an abstraction. What are the different components. First as Mark mentioned, support to the unemployed, and helping them not only with unemployment benefits and higher benefits, extended benefits, and health care, and a major increase in food stamps. Why does that matter. By supporting their incomes and their spending it creates jobs, throughout the economy. Secondly. There was a major influx of money to state governments, who, by resolving their own deficits when they have to cut programs and raise taxes, they actually--what Paul Krugman said is they are “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” like 50 little Herbert Hoovers. They are driving us into recession, by actually exacerbating the problem. Okay. When you give them the money, they don’t cut the programs, they keep the people that work for them in the local government’s employ. To keep the contractors and the private sector delivering construction contracts, health care, nursing homes, et cetera, employed, and by all those people being employed through spending money they keep jobs going throughout the economy. Okay, there’s also a third, a tax cut that was in effect in April, everybody’s withholding on their W-2’s, was actually increased, providing more income, more money to spend. Last there was some government spending in infrastructure that started going out. But the main infrastructure spending, actually is scheduled for 2010. That’s when we get the energy alternatives, that’s when we get more infrastructure, and other things that are going to create productivity in the long run as well as create jobs. What has been the effect of all this spending? Well as Mark said, over the last six months, we’ve actually seen a much different outcome than what was projected in the springtime, the economy shrank by a little bit, it would’ve shrunk by around 4 percent, but it actually shrank by a little bit less than 1 percent. In the summer the economy actually grew. Now, as someone dedicated to raising the living standards of the entire broad middle class, who’s satisfied with that, I’m not satisfied with that, okay? But “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” the question is, are you going to judge the Obama administration policy ineffective, because it hasn’t corrected what I think is 30 years of generating inequality, false-hearted, silly deregulation and worshipping of markets where we shouldn’t have done it that got us into this darn mess? I don’t think that’s quite appropriate. Thank you—don’t take my time. Um— We calculate that the Recovery Act has actually created anywhere between 1.1 to 1.5 million jobs by the end of September. I’m not satisfied that the job losses are 200,000 rather than 700,000, but I think it’s quite great. I’m very worried about the fact that unemployment is going to be high for many years to come, too high. I don’t blame that on President Obama, I blame that on the bums that put us in this mess. And you should too. Now, it’s true that the unemployment rate is higher than what the administration said it was going to be. They said if we did the Recovery Act it was going to only get to 8 percent. Well, let me mention something. The unemployment rate in March, before the Recovery Act even had an effect was already 8.5 percent. Now I did tell my friends in the White House, that’s a silly thing, don’t project like that. You shouldn’t do that, you’re going to get caught by that, and in fact, they have been hung by their own petard so to speak. But the fact is that, let me tell you that this is not a policy failure. This is a failure of my profession, economists. If you look at what “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” economists projected right at the time of the election, the blue- chip forecasts, and look at that same period I told you about, the nine months that includes the last half of last year and the first three months of this year. Now they’re already halfway through that period. And they were saying that the economy was going to shrink at a 1.5 percent rate, over that nine-month period. And it actually shrank by three times that much. So the fact is, what the administration got wrong in its forecast was it didn’t have a right sense of what things were going to be without the policy. I think they got the policy right, the policy’s had a substantial impact. Now has it solved all our problems, the fact is I’m not so sure how much more could’ve been done, economically. I can darn well tell you that politically, there was not much more on the table that they could get. What was put through the House and was put through the Senate, what was stopped, is some people that were in the Senate, who are known as moderates which just means they want to do a little bit less of what everybody else— And thank you very much.Larry Mishel—your time is up.And thank you very much.“Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” So here is where we are, we are halfway through the opening round of this Intelligence Squared US debate, I’m John Donvan of ABC News. We have six debaters, two teams out there, fighting it out over this motion, “Obama’s Economic Policies Are Working Effectively.” And now on to our fourth debater. Allan Meltzer who is an economist at Carnegie Mellon University, he is not the liberal member of his team, he is far from it. And if you caught CNBC a few days ago Allan Meltzer appeared there and I quote, “We have an administration that spends and spends and lies.” Ladies and gentlemen, Allan Meltzer.I’m here to talk about the Obama policy, not about apartment house fires. The policy has had a mixed result. There’re some small positive effects. But, there are five reasons for concluding the policies are not working effectively. First, the forecast was that $780 billion would be spent, the maximum unemployment rate would be 8 percent. Second, it’s now 10.2 percent, continuing to rise, that’s a failure. The second, is the administration recognition that the policy has failed. If the policy had succeeded, they would not be talking about another stimulus program, it recognizes, that talk recognizes, that the stimulus was not effective. That their “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” policies have, so far, been very weak. Third, the administration invented something called “jobs saved.” You can search economic textbooks from now to the end of time, you will not find something called “jobs saved.” Jobs saved, how do you know if you job is saved. Sure, it was true that, if we paid the states to have a smaller deficit, they didn’t fire quite so many teachers. But, we also shifted the deficit, to the federal government, with higher future tax rates that are going to have to pay for those, over the long term. This administration has failed on the main thing that it needs to do, which is to tell us, how are we going to get out of this mess. The composition of the stimulus is the fourth problem. That was decided in the Congress. It was a mistake by the Obama administration to let it be decided in the Congress, because the Congress was interested much more in the redistribution of wealth than it was in seeing jobs and the economy improved. One-third of the stimulus went to state and local governments, for their deficits. That may be good or bad policy, but it has very little stimulus. It simply transfers the deficit from one place to another. Also, a big piece of the stimulus went for a temporary tax cut. We’ve had lots of evidence on temporary tax cuts. The Bush administration, the Ford administration, the Carter administration, they all tried temporary tax cuts. The economic evidence is, temporary tax cuts don’t do much. The only major stimulating tax cuts that “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” we’ve had in the post-war period were the Kennedy-Johnson tax cuts, and the Reagan tax cuts. They were permanent tax cuts, people knew that once they got them, they were theirs. Finally fifth. This program is so off the block. Do you remember shovel-ready projects? Well, only 25 percent of the dollars for the infrastructure have been spent. Maybe that part of the program will do some good when it gets started, but the economy is in a slow recovery. So that part of the program is hardly a success. Now the economy has recovered, and the members of the affirmative tell us about how much better things are than they were a year ago. But is that a result of the Obama policy, or is it the natural tendency of the economy when it sinks, when inventories get very low, to be rebuilt, because that’s where a lot of the third-quarter improvement came from, the rebuilding of inventories. Very little of it in consumption. Most of the recovery in the third quarter came from temporary clunkers, and housing. The housing policy is full of corruption. People come in and ask for the $8,000, they send their children, because they’ve already bought a house, they send their children to do it, the Washington Post had a long expose of the corruption in the housing problem. I believe that we have the wrong policy. The problem for the United States for the future, the problem that we are all going to face for a long time to come, is that we have a huge debt, that a lot of, part of it is owed to foreigners, and it’s “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” growing. So, you don’t have be to an academic economist to figure out that the way we’re going to pay for that is to export. And the way to export more, would be to invest more, and earn our way out of that problem. What the administration is doing is the wrong thing. It’s trying to build up consumption. Fortunately, it isn’t being very successful. Now the CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, says we have a debate explosion. It’s unsustainable. It’s headed toward a debt crisis. The Congressional Budget Office says that every 10-point increase, percentage point increase in the debt ratio, lowers GDP growth by a quarter percent. This administration is increasing the debt by 50 percentage points. That’s a policy failure. The government debt to GDP ratio was about 50 percent, when the administration took office. The CBO trajectory says, it’s going to 700 percent. 700 percent is not a point we’re going to reach, because it’s unsustainable. That means, we’re headed, unless we do something about the exploding debt, we’re going to have a crisis. We absorb a considerable part of world savings, that too is unsustainable. Why. Well, the Bush drug bill. The Obama health care bill. A great many of the things that the Congress does, increase the deficit. You can’t believe, that we’re going to cut Medicare by $500 billion in order to get the drug bill passed. But that’s what you have to believe, if you believe that this administration is going to give you health care without paying. “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” We are on an unsustainable policy, and it’s a failed policy. Many years ago I started to tell people, capitalism without failure, is like religion without sin. Governor Spitzer’s going to talk about that in the context— In the context…in the context of the banking system— Thank you. Vote no!Allan Meltzer, your time is up.Thank you. Vote no!Our motion is, “Obama’s Economic Policies Are Working Effectively.” And our next debater, who will be arguing for the motion, Steve Rattner, who has gone through many careers. He began as a journalist. He switched to finance. Good call, by the way. And he recently had the beginning of a political career as a treasury official. He came to the White House and was given the job of the auto rescue—the GM deal, that’s him. The Chrysler deal, that’s him. However, he does not like the term Car Czar, which is too bad, because it’s very musical.Well, my paternal grandparents, who were fur peddlers in Moscow, would be rather shocked at the idea that I was a Czar of “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” any kind, so I will...I don’t have anything to follow Allan Meltzer’s last remark, I’m afraid... But I was struck listening to the first two speakers from the other side. I feel a little bit like Goldilocks. I heard one speaker that we in the Obama Administration were too hot and I heard one sort of imply we were too cold. And that makes me think we got it about right. All kidding aside, I actually do want to make a serious point. And with all due respect to the first two speakers from the other side, I want to try to take the ethereal world of theory and connect it to the real world of politics. Because I heard a few things that kind of, that did strike me. I heard Jamie say, Congress must provide more resources. We must resolve the toxic banks. We can’t let it be decided by Congress. Well, who else decides things besides Congress? We have to stop the displacement of people from their homes. I mean, these are all wonderful phrases but this is, as I found in my six months in Washington, not how the world works. As Rahm Emanuel said the other day, It’s fine to imagine yourself sitting under a shady tree at the Aspen Institute thinking of great policies. But then eventually you have to come to grips with the real world and deal with it. So you can say, people can say our stimulus program was not enough, but the fact is, as Larry said just at the “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” end of his remarks, it was all Congress was going to pass. There was no more there. It took every ounce of political muscle that the administration had to get that. You can say it was too much but I think as Larry Summers has said many times, when you are facing a potential disaster you err on the side of doing more, not less. And they did as much as was possible. So I just want to try to again connect back to this sort of real world of politics and of getting things done that was really one of the biggest surprises that I found coming to Washington. We may all talk about the President and say, It’s the President’s decision. The President recommends this, the President does that. But there is a little thing called Congress that has to be dealt with as well and that becomes a series of gives and takes and judgments. And so when Jamie Galbraith says, All Obama did was two things: the stimulus program and the low interest rates—which actually wasn’t even Obama. That was the Federal Reserve—it’s really not fair. I think the Obama Administration – and we’ll talk more about autos in a minute—but this Financial Regulatory Reform which has been put forward, this energy which has been put forward, this health care which has been put forward, this housing which has been put forward—all these problems that were unattended to for the last eight years, this administration is trying its hardest to address in a thoughtful, “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” responsible way. Let me turn for a minute now to the auto sector as well because I think my two fellow panelists made very, very coherent and logical and I hope ultimately persuasive cases for why the rest of the policy actions that the administration took were thoughtful. And so let me talk for a second about autos. Because it was an interesting area. It’s one of the few areas where the President actually did have authority. And so if you don’t like what the President did on autos, it’s fair to blame the administration for that because we didn’t have to go to Congress. We had TARP money. We didn’t have to deal with the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, except in one fairly minor way. We were pretty free to act. And when we showed up we had a bunch of people from one side of the aisle saying, You’ve gotta let these companies fail. You’ve gotta let the market work. I’m sorry I don’t have any quotes from Jamie, but I did see one quote from Allan when I was poking around where, when Lehman Brothers went out of business Allan said, No big deal. It’s fine. That’s the way--you should have consequences from capitalism. That’s the way it should work. And then a year later he said Lehman Brothers should have been saved. And so we had a lot of people saying to us, Oh, just let the market work. Well, I hope the people who “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” said, Let’s just let the market work, knew what that would have meant. It would have meant that Chrysler and GM would have shut down by the end of March. It would have meant that hundreds of suppliers would have gone out of business. They all would have liquidated. It would have meant that Ford would have stopped making cars because they wouldn’t have been able to get parts because their suppliers, many of them, would have been shut down. And you would have had something like three million people out of work, mostly in the industrial Midwest right at the end of March, right when the economy was at its worst. So it’s fine to say, Let’s let the market work. But again, let’s try to connect it back to the real world and what the real world consequences would be of letting that happen. Then you had some people, frankly, on the other side who basically said, You can’t let these companies go bankrupt. It would be catastrophic, it would be a disaster. Nobody would buy cars. They would eventually liquidate. You can’t possibly do that. But President Obama made the decision that we weren’t going to simply kick the can down the road, frankly, the way the previous administration had, and we were only going to inject money in the context of a fundamental restructuring that might have to include bankruptcy, which it ultimately did. And we achieved unprecedented sacrifices from all the stakeholders—from the “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” lenders, from the UAW, from the suppliers, from the dealers, from everybody who was affected—came to the table and, frankly, with a fair amount of muscle from the administration, participated in this restructuring. And the result of that was that today General Motors announced their earnings. They’re still losing money but their performance was wildly better than anybody would have guessed. They have forty-two billion dollars of cash in the bank at the moment and they are performing well ahead of the expectations that we had. They’re out of bankruptcy. Chrysler is out of bankruptcy in alliance with Fiat. So I think it is a very vivid example of a place where we weren’t too hot, we weren’t too cold. We were very pragmatic. We addressed the problem, we focused on it and we tried to come up with the best solution for all concerned. And I think that that exercise, which I was proud to be a small part of, was emblematic of the approach that this administration has taken. Tim Geithner and Larry Summers, the two principal economic policy makers, have strong views of principle but they are experienced, they are pragmatic. They know how to get things done. They are balanced and they are very thoughtful. And I think that the approach that they have taken throughout this process has been enormously positive and has led to all the “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” things that you heard Larry and Mark talk about in terms of bringing this country back from the abyss, bringing us back from a depression and getting us started down the road. Of course, I think it was—I forget who on the other side said—47 percent of people think the economy is the most important issue. Of course it’s the most important issue. But that doesn’t mean we haven’t made good progress. That doesn’t mean that disaster hasn’t been averted and those green shoots that people talk about have begun to sprout. So I was very proud to be a part of that and I would simply say to you, Would you prefer this administration or the last administration or some other administration? Because I think this administration has done awfully well.Thank you, Steve Rattner. Our motion is, “Obama’s Economic Policies Are Working Effectively.” And here as our final speaker, to argue against the motion: Eliot Spitzer, the former Attorney General and Governor of New York—a man whose career has been marked much in headlines, some that were favorable, some that were not. He is, however, at this point in the media himself, having become a financial columnist for Slate. And I want to point out to our audience that when this debate was conceived, Eliot was actually going to argue the other side. He was going to say the economic policies are working effectively. He has switched sides now. And Eliot, I hope in your opening remarks “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” you address the basic question: What’s that all about?Sure. Well, that was not a proposition, but thank you. First, first even, before I do that, John, well, let me just thank Allan Meltzer. If I follow his logic I have found religion. The short answer to your question is that I read Mark’s testimony. I was going to say, Mark, Thank you very much. We were on the same side and then I read his very persuasive testimony that he provided—testified before Congress a few weeks ago. And he goes through point by point—and I’ll get to it in a moment—that the terror that we are facing, and how treacherous the shoals are that we are going to run up against in a very short order economically—and I said, My goodness, this is not working at all. And so, Mark, thank you for persuading me. I will distribute it at the end of the day and you can all be-- I think you will vote our side once you have read Mark’s testimony.I’m sure you will next time around. Well, let me also say very clearly that the Obama Administration’s economic policies, in my mind, stand for continuity you can believe in. We are still giving away vast sums of money to the same people with the same result so the bank profits are way up, unemployment is up, “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” investment is not increasing, consumption is not increasing and we are not seeing any of the wise transformation in the fundamental structure of our economy that this crisis calls for. We all We all remember Rahm Emanuel’s often-cited statement that a crisis is a terrible thing to waste. Indeed, it is. This crisis is the rare opportunity that we have to change the direction of our economy, an economy that has been sliding in the wrong direction for many years. On that proposition we would all agree. And I think that Larry used a very prescient metaphor of an apartment house that is burning down. And he would say that the Obama Administration came with fire hoses blazing and put out half of the fire. Our perspective is they didn’t call the fire brigade from the next county, that they didn’t say, What can we do to stop the fire? What can we do from the air? How can we add other fire retardants to turn this off and make sure that there is not a fire next time around? And that is what we have to do, that failure structurally is what we are talking about. Let’s deal with numbers just for a moment. And these are numbers from Mark’s testimony. They are there out online, of course. These are irrefutable numbers. Unemployment up to 17.5 percent, 26 million people, increasing at the rate of several “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” hundred thousand per month. Yes, the 700,000 a month of that was when we were in free fall. Right now we are still in free fall— two hundred thousand. There is not any affirmative news on the job front. And I will get to General Motors in a moment in terms of what they stand for in terms of jobs. Foreclosures: foreclosures are getting worse, not better. Your testimony—and we all agree—2010 will be worse than 2009, which was worse than 2008. Why? Adjustable rate mortgages are going to reset next year. Fewer and fewer home owners will be able to afford to make their mortgage payments. That crisis continues unabated. And one of the things the Obama Administration did not do that it should have done was push for the legislative power to give judges the power to reform mortgages in the bankruptcy context. I, at that point, when I saw that, I said, How could they not do this? It is fundamental, it is necessary, it is right. It would help the middle class that we supposedly care about most fundamentally. The number, by the way: foreclosures are up twenty-three percent this year over last year and it will get worse. Commercial real estate, we care about it less, other than as it affects the banking community. You in your testimony say hundreds of banks will go bankrupt next year as a result of the mortgages in the commercial real estate sector that simply cannot be refinanced—grossly undervalued, still “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” accounting gimmicks. They are left, right and center. We have not faced to it. It will be a disaster. Credit markets are dysfunctional. Your word, we all agree with it. Credit markets are dysfunctional. Small, medium sized businesses cannot borrow, simply cannot borrow, even though we have given trillions of dollars to the megabanks that came crawling to Washington, say, Please, please, please, we can’t pay our bonuses. State and local We won’t even get into it cause I only have 2:52 left. The AIG conduit payments to Goldman, the 12.9 billion, 100 percent on the counter party payments—absolutely outrageous. Tim Geithner must explain this to the American public. Absolutely outrageous. State and local governments will be going bankrupt. They are down ten, 15 percent in their revenues. We have handled it for one year. They will go over a precipice next year. That will lead to the full-time shutdown of school districts, fire districts, community services. That is where we are seeing it because property values will plummet, property revenues will plummet. Sales tax revenue, real estate revenues—all dramatically down. General Motors today—Steve, you’re right. GM had better numbers today. Third “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” quarter they only lost $1.12 billion. Congratulations. We’re on the road to recovery. Let me tell you something. Do you know where they saw signs of improvement? Their China subsidiaries. Look at, disaggregate the numbers, really read what happened. China sales are up twenty, 30, 40 percent, first quarter to third quarter. Sales in the U.S. down. Next year’s market, they had been presuming under your plan 12 and a half million auto sales next year, calendar year 2010. And the U.S. economy downgraded to eleven today. Think about that and what that means. They will not survive. Chrysler will probably go over the cliff as well. They’re going to be selling Fiats. That’s their business model. It won’t work. Let’s be real about this. Manufacturing jobs, we are losing. We have lost a third of our manufacturing jobs in the last decade. They do not come back, ever. You look month after month over the last decade, good times and bad, they do not come back. It is worse now than it’s ever been. That is the core of our economy. We cannot all be lawyers and investment bankers. We need clients. The clients are all gone. It doesn’t work. The fundamental error of this administration is that it is continuity. They have embraced the Bush Administration view that if you solve the problem of big banks everything else flows from that. They are wrong. Too big to fail is too big. They don’t get it. The only two “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” people I know who don’t appreciate that are Tim Geithner and Larry Summers. Paul Volcker, Alan Greenspan, Henry Kaufman, Mervyn King—every major academic has said, We must get rid of too big to fail. They refuse to cross that threshold. Until they do we will not reform the financial services sector and that is where they have focused to the exclusion of virtually the entire rest of the economy. They do not appreciate the power they had. They do not know how to negotiate for the fundamental change. We’ve been involved in what I call a regulatory charade, pretending the problem was lack of power. And the regulators, they had the power, they chose not to use it. Who were those regulators? The same folks we’re now promoting and sitting there making these misguided policies. It’s time for more fundamental change. Call in the fire brigade from the next county. Let’s put out the fire. Thank you very much.And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate where the motion being argued, “Obama’s Economic Policies Are Working Effectively.” And as you recall, at the beginning of the evening we asked you to vote on whether you agree or disagree with the motion. And we now have the results from our live audience. Before the debate, the motion being, “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” “Obama’s Economic Policies Are Working Effectively”—before the debate 32 percent of you are for the motion, 29 percent against and 39 undecided. That is where things started. You will vote again at the conclusion and the team that has changed the most minds will be declared our winner. Now, on to round two. It’s our middle round and this is the round where the debaters go more head to head. They’ll be taking questions from you, the audience, and from myself as well. And I would like to start by lifting something from what Eliot Spitzer just said. He came up with five words that more or less sum up their position—we are still in free fall. Is it true? Anybody on the team arguing for?I’ll take a crack at it. No. In a word. Do you remember back a year ago? Do you remember? That’s free fall. That’s when we were panicked, when there were runs on major banking institutions— Wachovia, Washington Mutual. You were afraid to keep your money in your bank. The stock market was in complete free fall. Housing values were falling 5, 10, 15 percent. We were losing 700,000 jobs per month. That’s free fall. Today, we’ve got stability. The policies aren’t magic. They can’t work overnight in a matter of a few months. But look where we are today. Think about the counter-factual. Think about what the world would look like without these policy responses. In my strong opinion, we averted what would have been another “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” depression. Yes, this was a very severe recession, but we averted a depression. So, no, we’re not in free fall. We’reI’d like to ask the audience to – with a show of applause, whether you find that point convincing. Are we— And now to the response of Eliot Spitzer.Well, let’s frame it this way for you, Mark. There is the easy decision, which is to spend a ton of money. We needed to do that. We all knew we would. I don’t think it mattered who the President was, and thankfully, obviously, I am a fervent supporter of the President. We were going to spend a huge sum of money. There are—Eliot, I just want to encourage you to get a little closer to your mic.I’m sorry.Thanks.There are three questions that followed that actually matter. Spending the money is the premise. The first question is who pays for it. And it’s not so obvious that it needs to be “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” exclusively the tax payers as opposed to those who are equity debt holders and indeed the former executives of the companies. Even though that would be a small number numerically, nonetheless, symbolically important. So who pays, and we’ve gotten it wrong in that regard. We have not gotten debt and equity to kick in sufficiently. Two: what reform do you get for the money you’re spending? Because rebuilding the same façade, the same edifice that’s been broken will not get us anywhere. And the primary grievance that I have with this administration is that we are spending the money rebuilding the same structures, the same decision making process that got us to what we are right now. And third: job creation is the most important metric out there.That’s fourth, Eliot, fourth.Great, you’re an economist. I was I was in political science. We can, usually weDon’t fudge, now, don’t fudge.No, no, no. No, no, no. Mark, we had a premise and three questions.—“Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Wait, let me bring in Larry Mishel.So...Larry, what ...what you just heard?But job, job creation—Eliot, let me, let me bring in Larry Mishel.Sure.Well, I really think it’s worth keeping two things separate. One is the whole financial market issue, which is primarily the motivation of what you’re talking about, Eliot. You’re talking about spending. And then there’s the question of jobs and the Recovery Act. And it seems to me that there was nothing foreordained that anyone who got elected was going to actually do what was done and put together a nearly eight hundred billion dollar package to go through Congress—They wouldn’t have been able to get it through Congress—and that was going to be able to move the needle as much as the needle has been moved. Not that we’re to be satisfied. I mean, you know, this is the-- my “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” friends that are fellow liberals—Jamie and Eliot—are basically arguing against the excellent is the enemy of the very, very good. And that is, in my mind, just not really— and especially to have a former elected official do that, just seems otherworldly to me, to tell you the truth. You know, I’m a close observer of Washington. I watched what the so-called moderates did in the Senate to that stimulus bill. They took out, a substantial amount of aid to the states. They took out a school modernization program that last summer could have actually rebuilt a lot of schools, created a lot of jobs. And they stuck in there something that was going to be done anyway, which is the ANT relief, which is basically tax relief for wealthy income tax payers. That in effect, is proof positive that they got as much as they could out of the political system. If you wanted to get more you had to have a different Congress. I don’t think there was a different political strategy. I canAll right, let me bring in Jamie.The question before the House is not whether in the very difficult political environment the President’s team did as much as they could. The question before the House is, Are the policies working effectively? That’s a question about the economy and not about the politics. Let’s look at where we are. Let’s try to come to grips “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” with the scale of the disaster. What has happened here is that the financial wealth of the American middle class in their houses and in their 401k’s and their bank accounts, built up over six or seven decades, has largely evaporated. It’s a colossal disaster. People who thought they were going to retire on their home equity aren’t going to have it. Delinquency rates in the state of Florida are over 20 percent, foreclosures over 10 percent. This is an incredible thing. If we think now how many jobs we need to get back to where, to fill the hole by 2011 it’s more than five hundred thousand jobs a month, if something hasn’t happened since 1950-51. If we want to do it over five years it’s three million jobs over the course of each single year—something that I don’t believe has ever been achieved. If we’re going to deal with the problem we have to think about the scale of policy that goes well beyond what the political environment in Washington is prepared to deal with and we have to persuade it to change. Otherwise, we are not going to solve these problems.So let me bring that back to Steven Rattner, who is arguing for the motion, the policies are working. And Steven, that’s an argument that they’re conceding, the rescue succeeded. The canoe did not go off the cliff. But they’re saying going forward, that does not solve where we need to get to.“Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Well, I don’t think any of us would disagree with that. I think, without getting into a big semantic debate over the question, if the question were: Is the economy in a happy place?, we’d all be on one side of the table. The question in effect, in my mind, is, Has Obama put forward and tried to implement policies that will have a positive effect on the economy and move it in the right direction? And I think, I hope we’ve all made a very clear, convincing case that it has, and will. Nobody would disagree, you guys are great at giving us a litany of what’s wrong. Eliot, you gave us six minutes and forty-five seconds of what’s wrong with the economy and I only heard one or two suggestions what to actually do about it. I don’t know what your suggestion is about General Motors. Is it to let it to go bankrupt and have a couple of million people out of jobs? I don’t know what your suggestion is about Goldman Sachs and the derivatives contracts. I don’t like it any better than you do. Would you like the financial system to melt down the way Lehman Brothers did? I don’t know what your suggestion is about how to fix regulatory reform, which the administration has put forward a proposal which is mired in all the Congressional politics around it. And I guess, I’m surprised because you were Governor. You know what it’s like up there. You were the, you showed up in Albany and said, Day one everything changes. And it didn’t because you had the “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” legislature.Well, then let me, I’ll tell you exactly what I would have done. It may take more than two minutes but I’ll limit it. In terms of cars I would have said, No, we’re not going to just give billions of dollars to a shelvable company. We will say we will buy five hundred thousand battery powered cars two years from now from whatever domestic producer, I don’t care whether it’s GM, Hyundai, Kia. Produce it here, 80 percent produced domestically. We want to stimulate that type of productivity.That’s—And, no, no, no. And we will build the electric recharging stations, akin to what Eisenhower did, on the interstate system. Build a new infrastructure. Create, take the money that we gave to Goldman and instead of saying, Here it is, 12.9 billion—use it to create Felix Rohatyns in the infrastructure bank. That is what we need, that’s where the dollars should have gone. The dollars could have been used in many different ways. Instead, when we made these enormous transfers, based upon nothing more than the say-so that we need it—which they didn’t because they’ve said they didn’t have any exposure to the AIG CDS, situation. They were fully hedged. We didn’t ask for “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” anything back. It was the failure to ask for anything back that was fundamentally wrong and that is why we are left with the same system we had before.Let me ask Allan Meltzer. Aren’t, aren’t we, are we not better off with a GM in some form rather than no General Motors?Aren’t we?Allan, Allan, are we not better off having some form of General Motors and people working there than no General Motors?I’m with Eliot. We, what the country needs in a more general sense, not just confined to automobiles—what the country needs to do is think about the enormous debt that it owes to foreigners and how it’s going to pay them without bankrupting the country. And the only answer that exists is you have to export. We have to export. And in order to do that we have to invest. And the right program was an investment program, not a consumption program, not a bailout program. That was a mistake. Now, they want to say the administration was great in pushing this program. The administration made a mistake of letting the Congress write that program. So instead of writing in a program “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” that the United States needs to solve its long term problem, the problems that you and I and everyone else are going to face for the next ten or twenty years, is how to handle that debt, how to get our exports up, how to get our consumption down—not how to get our consumption up. That was a fundamental mistake. The administration made that mistake. It should never have made that mistake because Larry Summers certainly should have known that the problem we’re going to have is how to finance that debt with more exports. And that’s going to require greater investment. And one of those investments is the kind of investment that Eliot was talking about.Okay, I want to come back to Mark. I want to come back to you but I want to ask you to hold for just a minute. We’re going to come back to Mark Zandi but I want to, at this point, get you ready to turn this over to you for questions. Reminding you of a couple of things. When the microphone, we have ushers with microphones. If you raise your hands and I spot you, I’ll signal that it’s for you. The microphone will come to you. I’m asking you to rise. If you’re a member of the news media we ask that you to identify yourself. And I want to remind you when you hold the microphone to hold it about one fist’s way, distance from your mouth so that we can hear you. And the last thing is please ask a question. We don’t want speeches and “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” we are not asking you to debate with the debaters because we already have six and that’s even. Mark Zandi, to respond.Well, just a fact, one fact and then two responses. Just another statistic. Household net worth, that’s the value of all the things that we owe less all the things that we owe. This is our net worth. It declined by $15 trillion between the peak in ’07 Q3 through the bottom in ’08 Q4. $15 trillion. And just to give you a context, there’s about $60 trillion worth, at the peak there was about $60 trillion in household net worth. Since the beginning of the year or since the administration’s inauguration, household net worth has risen by $5 trillion, $5 trillion. So that obviously reflects the improvement in the equity markets, stock prices—at least as measured by the S&P 500—are up. I didn’t look today but it’s up somewhere between 25 and 30 percent since he was brought into office. And housing values have started to rise. They fell sharply through the beginning of the year down 30 percent from the peak and now they’ve begun to rise. So to me that’s a very important statistic because that’s our net worth. Now, two quick responses, one with respect to the deficit. I think this is a legitimate concern. Obviously, it is a critical concern that we had a $1.4 trillion deficit, at 10 percent of GDP in fiscal “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” year ’09. And we’re going to run up a $1.2 trillion deficit at least in the current fiscal year. These are big numbers. But, you know, this was a Hobson’s choice for us. It really was no choice. If the policy makers did not respond aggressively to this and use the resources the economy would still be in recession, the financial system would be in disarray and the cost to taxpayers measurably greater, measurably greater. The deficits would be larger than they are. So we really had no choice in this. And I think, as well, the deficits are something that are the result of it. Now, finally, one other response. You know, in the efforts to shore ","cornell-intelligence-squared-debates"
"090914%20Common%20Core","So we’re going to begin again or anew, and we’d like to, love to start the radio broadcast with all of you clapping, so let’s have one more. Sometimes when we set out to fix what is broken, we can argue not only about what the fix should be, but actually about what the problem is. And when it comes to American public education, the diagnosis has been offered that our schools suffer from a lack of consistent standards coast to coast about what our kids should leave school knowing. And the fix that has been adopted in a number of states in the last few years is a set of standards called the Common Core, which have become the most contentious issue in American education in the last generation, with disputes about who drew up these standards, whether they result in kids being over tested and even whether standards make sense. Do they have to be common? Are we fixing the right problem? Well, that sounds like the makings of a debate. So let’s have it. Yes or no to this statement, Embrace the Common Core. A debate from Intelligence Squared US. I’m John Donvan. We are at the Kaufman Music Center in New York City. We have four superbly qualified debaters who will be arguing two against two on this specific motion, Embrace the Common Core. As always, our debate will go in three rounds and then our live audience here in New York City votes to choose the winner, and only one side wins. Our motion is Embrace the Common Core. Let’s please meet our debaters. Please welcome first, Carmel Martin. And Carmel, you are arguing for the motion, Embrace the Common Core. You are right now at the Center for American Progress. You’re an executive VP there for policy. You were in the Obama Administration four years as Assistant Secretary at the Department of Education. Carmel you have and will argued the standards were, the Common Core standards, were first gathered together by the states, but President Obama then endorsed them and in the eyes of many of his opponents, he them tainted them and made them unpopular. The question we have for you is back at the beginning of this, did anybody see that there would be a political backlash with the administration’s endorsement?Well honestly John, we weren’t thinking about political backlash. We were thinking about what was best for kids, but I do agree that the issue has become a little bit of a political football, which I think is unfortunate and I hope people will focus on what’s best for children.So no football tonight then. And your partner is, Carmel?My partner is my sometimes opponent actually, always my friend and distinguished colleague, the brilliant Michael Petrilli.Ladies and gentlemen, Michael Petrilli. Michael, that was a very nice introduction.I was hoping for ""good-looking,"" but I'll take brilliant. That's good-- that's okay.Yeah.You are not only good looking. You are also president of the education policy think tank, the Thomas Fordham Institute. You're an executive editor of Education Next. The Common Core, as everybody in-- who knows the issue knows is that it's not an easy left- right issue, that there are people on both sides, from both ends of the spectrum. And a case in point in that is that your debate partner, as pointed out, is a liberal--Affirmative.--while you represent a conservative think tank.Right.However, recently, a number of conservative governors have pulled out of the Common Core. So, is it-- is it starting to get a little lonely on the conservative side?Perhaps a little lonelier, but it's important to know that still half of the nation's Republican governors are supportive of the Common Core. So, lonelier, but I am far from alone.And you're going to try to pull some people over to your side tonight.Absolutely. On the left and the right.Thank you very much. Michael Petrilli, everybody. Our motion is Embrace the Common Core. We have two debaters who are arguing against this motion. First, please welcome Carol Burris. Carol, you are-- you are principal. You are the-- the educator on the stage tonight. You're principal of South Side High School in Rockville Center in New York. 2013, a New York High School Principal of the Year. Congratulations on that. You're also the author of three books. And one of these books was called ""Opening the Common Core,"" at which time you were supportive of the standards. Now you are arguing on the other side. What do your students at-- at South Side make of this whole controversy over the Common Core?Well, over half of my ninth graders last year refused to take the Common Core test when they were in eighth grade, with their parents' permission. So, I think it's safe to say they're not fans.All right. I have a feeling maybe some of them are here. Thank you, Carol Burris. And your partner tonight is?My partner is the good looking and charming Rick Hess.Ladies and gentlemen, Rick Hess. Rick, you're at the American Enterprise Institute. You are an education policy studies resident scholar and director of that section. You have a blog called ""Rick Hess Straight Up” at Education Week. Like your opponent, Mike, you are an executive editor for Education Next. And it's also interesting to note, you and your opponent Mike co-wrote a book in 2006. So, are there no more collaborations down-- down the road for the two of you?You know, John, we wrote that book on No Child Left Behind after Mike-- who had been an enthusiast-- came to share my more measured take. I'm hopeful that history will eventually repeat itself.All right. Thank you. Rick Hess. And the lineup showing just how complex this topic is and how the bedfellows are strangely made. Our motion is Embrace the Common Core. This is a debate. There will be a winner and a loser by a vote of the live audience. By the time the debate has ended, you will have been asked to vote twice-- once before the debate and once again after the debate. And the team whose numbers have moved the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. Let's go to the preliminary vote. If you go to the keypads at your seat. We're going to start with that. I'll remind you-- you want to pay attention to keys 1, 2, and 3. You push 1 if you agree with the motion ""Embrace the Common Core."" If you're with this team. You push 2 if you're against it. If you do not agree that we should embrace the Common Core, you push #2. And that's this team. If you're undecided, which is a perfectly honorable position of which to start this, you push #3. If you push the wrong key, just correct yourself. The system will lock in your last vote. Looks like everybody's got it, so let's move on to Round 1. Our motion is Embrace the Common Core. Round 1, opening statements by each debater in turn. They will be seven minutes each. Speaking first for the motion, Embrace the Common Core, Mike Petrilli. You can make your way to the lectern. Michael Petrilli, President of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute. He is research fellow at Stanford’s Hoover Institution and author of ""The Diverse Schools Dilemma."" Ladies and gentlemen, Michael Petrilli.Thank you very much. It's a real honor to be here. I was just surprised-- I just saw Rick press the undecided button. So, that was interesting. We'll see how that goes. It is such an honor to be here today. Let me tell you a little bit about what our game plan is, that - - Carmel and I. We've been together all afternoon, we've been scheming about this. I will start by talking about what it means to embrace the Common Core. Then I will talk about some of the problems in our education system and frankly in previous waves of reform that the Common Core is trying to address. Carmel then is going to talk about the process of developing the Common Core, the role that educators play, the role that evidence played, as well as talk about some of the equity issues that are at stake here, how the Common Core can help to narrow the achievement gap. Now, what you won't hear us argue is, first of all, that Common Core is going to solve all of our nation's educational problems because, of course, it won't. You're not going to hear us say that the Common Core are perfect. They were not handed down from Mount Sinai, they are not set in stone, right, or we're going to hear plenty of concerns about this individual standard or that individual standard, so you won't hear us say that they're perfect. And you're not going to hear us say that it's all going perfectly out there around the country, because, of course, it's not all going perfectly out there around the country. This is a big country, 50 million kids in public schools, 100,000 of those schools, and like any ambitious reform, it's a work in progress, okay? But what you are going to hear us argue is that despite all of that you should still embrace the Common Core. Now, why is that? Why should you embrace the Common Core? And what does that mean? In our view, to embrace the Common Core is, first of all, to embrace the idea that our schools should have standards, all right, that doesn't sound so radical, and that the standards that we have should be set at a high enough level to indicate that our students are ready for what comes next. And that means kids graduating from high school, that they're either ready to go and succeed in college or to go and get a good paying job. Now, what you might have to understand is that this is a radical departure from how we used to do this. States did have standards before the Common Core, but, by and large, they were set at a very, very low level. And so what that meant is that students could meet those standards, they could pass the standardized tests connected to those standards, but it didn't mean that they were ready for success later on. In fact, in many states it didn't even mean that they were at grade level. And so we had a system that was giving a lot of false information out there to students, to teachers, to parents alike. So, to embrace the Common Core is to say, ""Let's embrace standards that are set at this college and career ready level."" It's also to say that we should embrace the idea of moving to next generation assessments, right, tests that measure these standards, that are worlds better than the tests that we've been living with for the past two decades. Many of us in this room as parents or as teachers, we know that there has been this huge focus on standardized testing in this country. And unfortunately, by and large, those tests have been terrible, fill in the blank, multiple choice tests, tests that don't do a good job measuring what students know and that encourage very low level kind of teaching and learning in the classroom. But now, after four years, we're finally getting to the point where there are new assessments coming connected to the Common Core that are going to be much more like advanced placement exams or international baccalaureate exams like the ones that Carol uses in her school, and this is our chance to move to those assessments. So, if you embrace the Common Core, its high standards, its next generation assessments, that's what we are moving towards. Now, what's the problem we're trying to address? Every study that's ever been done on American education comes to pretty much the same conclusion. It's not that our schools are failing, though some are failing, but on the large, it's not that schools are failing, it's that our schools, by and large, are mediocre when compared to schools overseas. They're in the middle of the pack. They're not the best schools in the world, they're not the worst schools in the world. They're in the middle of the pack. And it's not just our demographics. It's not just because we have a lot of childhood poverty, though we do. Our rich kids are in the middle of the pack compared to other rich kids around the world, poor kids, middle class kids, high achievers, low achievers. Throughout the education system, it's this concern around mediocrity. And we've known this for 30 years. And we have been working hard at trying to address that. And we've made some progress, right? Poor and minority and low achieving kids today are reading and doing math two to three grade levels ahead of where they were back in the 1990s. That's incredible progress. And our public education system deserves credit for making that progress. And almost certainly it was because back in the '90s and 2000s, states decided to set standards, to have tests that measured those standards, and to have accountability systems to make those standards stick. And it-- again, we've made real progress. But because the standards were set so low and because the tests have been so easy, all of the focus has been getting the lowest performing kids over that very low standard, right? And that's led to great progress for the kids at the bottom but it hasn't done much for the kids at the middle or the kids at the top because they were so far ahead of those standards that it didn't get much traction with them. At the same time, it's come along with a lot of unintended consequences, and we know about those, too, teaching to the test, narrowing of the curriculum, driving out a lot of the joy that we want to have in our schools, okay? And again, Carol, Rick, many others have been very eloquent on this point. This is our chance to embrace the Common Core, is to fix all of that, to move to a system with much higher standards but also better tests that give better information but that also encourage better teaching and learning in the classroom. Carmel and I had a chance today to meet with a group of teachers, many of them are here in the room tonight, to tell us how it's going with Common Core. And it's not perfect. There's issues, and there is bumps in the road, but they talked about these higher expectations for their students that some of these kids, they couldn't-- you know, four years ago they couldn't believe that the kids could perform at the level that they're performing now, but these higher standards have pushed them in that direction. Now, Rick and Carol are going to say that we should not embrace the Common Core, and I don't know if they're willing to hug the Common Core or kiss the Common Core or fist bump the Common Core, so I'm not-- we'll see what their position it, but what do they want? Do they want us to go back to the old standards, the ones that were set way too low, that gave everybody this false impression that everything was fine? Do they want us to stick with the-- still the standardized tests, these rinky-dink standardized tests that we've lived with for 20 years? Do they want to follow the example of Oklahoma, the one state in the country that has repealed the Common Core and replaced it with something else right away, and in Oklahoma today, today in Oklahoma schools, teachers did not know what standards they were supposed to teach to. They don't know six months from now which tests they're going to be held accountable to, but I guarantee you it's not going to be one of these next generation assessments because there's no time and there's no money for that. It's going to be one of these rinky-dink assessments instead. Lots more to talk about throughout this debate, but for all of those reasons, this is why you should vote to ""Embrace the Common Core."" Thank you.Thank you, Mike Petrilli. And that is our motion, ""Embrace the Common Core."" And now here to speak against the motion, Carol Burris. She is an award-winning principal at South Side High in Rockville Centre, New York. She also blogs on ""Answer Sheet"" in the Washington Post. Ladies and gentlemen, Carol Burris.Good evening, and thank you for inviting us to this very important debate about the quality of the Common Core standards. I say ""quality"" because this isn't a debate about whether or not we need standards. Of course we do. And this isn't a debate about whether or not schools should improve. That's a given. Rather, this is a debate that asks whether or not the Common Core standards are so remarkable and so sound that we should embrace them as the standards by which every American child is both educated and judged. In a little while, Rick is going to explain the flaws in the design of the standards. As a lifelong educator, I'm going to explain the flaws in the standards themselves. Let's begin with kindergarten. Listen while I read this Common Core kindergarten standard. ""Compose and decompose numbers from 11 to 19 into 10 ones and some further ones. Example, by using objects or drawings and record each composition or decomposition by a drawing or equation. Example, 18 equal 10 plus eight. Understand that these numbers are composed of 10 ones and one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, or nine ones."" Now, I ask you, should that be a standard for a five-year-old? Or to put it another way, do the standards know and match what we know now about childhood development? Well, in 2010, when the standards were first rolled out, experts said, ""No."" Five hundred early childhood experts, pediatricians, psychologists, researchers, and teachers found the Common Core standards to be so developmentally inappropriate that they called for their suspension in grades K through 3. Back to Louisa Moats, one of the few early childhood experts that were on the team that created the literacy standard, is now one of their most outspoken critics. Why? Because the Common Core standards disregard decades of research on early reading development and instead yank up difficulty levels at every grade. So, how could the developers of the Common Core get it so wrong? The Common Core standards were built backwards from grade 12 down to pre-K. But kids don't grow backwards, they grow forward, and their development is unique and uneven. The Common Core requiring that kindergarteners count from one to 100 by ones and 10s, even though we know that most five years old can count to 20, is as silly as expecting all two-year-olds to be potty trained. Research did not guide the development of the Common Core standards. And then there is the math. Most of the time, when we think of standards, we think about what topics should be taught at different grade levels. But the Common Core goes beyond and seeks to influence how math should be taught, often in confusing ways. Here’s a first grade example. “Use strategies such as counting on, making ten. Example, eight plus six equals eight plus two plus four equal ten plus four equal 14, decomposing the number leading to a 10. Example, 13 minus four equal 13 minus three minus one equal ten minus one equal nine, and creating equivalent but easier or known sums. Example, adding six plus seven, by creating the known equivalent, six plus six plus one equal twelve plus one equal thirteen.”Now, when you listen to that, are we surprised that we have created complicated homework problems that comedians joke about and that make children cry? This is why parents and teachers are rebelling. In one year, in the bluest of states, California and New York, the Common Core has moved from majority approval to majority disapproval. In one year, teacher support for the Common Core has dropped 30 points. This is not a Tea Party rebellion. This is a parent rebellion and it’s happening because the Common Core has moved from paper to practice, from the ideal to the real. And then yes, there are the tests. Even as the consortia developed national tests, New York State is giving Common Core tests twice. And guess what, they’re multiple choice tests and they don’t look anything like the IB. Results have been devastating for our special education students, our English language learners, and our students of poverty. And they’re based on arbitrary measures of proficiency. Bad test scores have consequences for kids. Fourteen states require that third graders be left back based on poor reading scores. Kids are put in remedial classes. Test scores decide who gets into gifted programs and into competitive schools. High school graduation rates are expected to plummet. The Carnegie Corporation has predicted that the six year drop out rate will double, from 15 percent to 30 percent. And the four year graduation rate will drop from 75 percent to 53 percent. We already have a preview. The GED test was the line to the Common Core. It dropped 19 points to a passing rate of 53 percent. Here’s the bottom line:There is no evidence, none, that the Common Core standards and its tests will actually increase student learning. And as we engage in this experiment, we may very well hurt the kids who need our support the most. And so I urge you to vote no at the end of this debate, because if we embrace the Common Core, we are embracing a set of flawed standards that will mark as failures more than half of our kids. And your kids and your grandkids deserve better than that. Thank you.Thank you Carol Burris. And a reminder of where we are, we are halfway through the opening round of the Intelligence Squared US debate. I’m John Donvan. We have four debaters, two teams of two, arguing it out over this motion, “Embrace the Common Core.”You have heard from the first two debaters, and now on to the third. Let’s please welcome Carmel Martin. She is executive vice president for policy at the Center for American Progress. She’s served as assistant secretary for planning evaluation and policy development at the Department of Education. Ladies and gentlemen, Carmel Martin.Thank you John and thanks to Intelligence Squared for bringing this debate here tonight and including me in it. I want to start by telling you the story of Janelle, a young woman from Philadelphia who I spoke to recently. And whose story embodies why I feel so strongly that the Common Core is a crucial step forward for American education. Janelle is an African American woman from the north side of Philadelphia. Her parents believed in the power of education to transform lives. They had one overriding message for their daughter: Do well in school and you will be the first person in the family to go to college. Janelle got the message. She worked hard. She took honors courses. She got all As. She was her vice president of her senior class. And she graduated in the top of her class. She was number three in her class. She diligently applied to college, and she and her parents ecstatically celebrated when she not only got into college, a public four-year institution in Pennsylvania, but got a full scholarship. But it wasn't very long after going to college before she realized that she had been duped. The As she'd earned in her honors courses in high school seemed to bear little relationship with what it took to succeed in her college-level courses. In subject after subject, she struggled, becoming more and more dejected. She explained to me how one of the problems that she encountered was that in high school, her teachers helped her translate her textbooks. But when she got to college, her professors expected her to be able to do that for herself and then analyze the information, as opposed to just understanding it. And her-- she didn't have those skills. They hadn't taught them to her in her high school. As a result-- as a result, Janelle's GPA dropped and she lost eligibility for her scholarships. Now, the good news is, she did-- she has managed to return to college as a sophomore. She was able to fill the gap left by her scholarships with student loans. Many children in her-- in her situation would have given up and dropped out. The Common Core is for Janelle and for the thousands of students who are giving it their all but not getting their money's worth. Now, I agree with something Rick has said before, which is that standards are meaningless unless they're translated into effective instruction. As Mike noted, the Common Core is not a silver bullet for all that ails our education system. But it is an essential building block. And for students like Janelle who, for generations, have been shortchanged by the old, failed system, new standards will help ensure they are never left behind again. We know what we were doing before wasn't working. We see remediation rates as high as one in four college students who are not ready for college-level material. And that translates, just here in New York, to $80 million in wasted resources that could be spent on other supports for our students to be successful. And that doesn't even address the students like Janelle who are not in remediation, but are struggling with college level content. Some schools, like the one that Carol runs, have adopted International Baccalaureate programs or advanced placement courses to supplement the old state standards, but we can't rely on visionary principles like Carol-- or a patchwork of programs to close our nation's gaping achievement gaps or prepare future generations to compete with China. Now, I'd like to cut-- clear up a couple misconceptions about the Common Core that had been promoted by the Glenn Becks of the world. First the Common Core was not developed in secret and was not developed by the federal government. This was an initiative led by Democratic Governor Markell of Delaware and Republican Governor Sonny Perdue of Georgia. Back in 2008, virtually all of the governors, with the exception of Rick Perry and Sarah Palin, were strongly supportive of it. Unlike the previous patchwork of standards, the Common Core was developed with significant input from educators and content experts, like the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. The authors consulted teacher unions, the civil rights community, college leaders, and business leaders. The standards were revised based on over 10,000 comments from the general public. And contrary to the assertion of the opposition, most teachers are not opposed to the standards, and indeed strongly support them. Now, I appreciate that there has been a great deal of controversy about the way the standards have been implemented and concerns with how test scores are being used in our education system. I think those concerns are real. And we should-- we should address them. But-- and teachers, when asked about the standards in the context of accountability-- particularly accountability for themselves-- their own performance-- they're hesitant about the standards. But despite these concerns, a Winston poll in early August revealed that two out of three teachers approved of the adoption and believed they are what their students need to be successful. And when implementation is done well, which I strongly believe requires that you use teachers to help you develop an implementation plan-- teachers feel excited about the standards and believe they have more, not less, freedom in their classroom. John, a high school geometry teacher, said it better than I could: “The old standards gave teachers a set of specific and sometimes constricting direction on where to turn, when to turn, and how fast to go. The Common Core standards instead give us mileposts to aim for, tell us where we should end up but not how to get there.” And this was something that Mike and I heard loud and clear this afternoon when we were talking to teachers from right here in New York. Later in the debate, I'm sure we'll talk more about the challenges of implementation and the need for commonsense use of tests. Those are important issues. But because we have challenges doesn't mean that we should turn our backs on the incredible work that's been done over the last four years here in New York and around the country to lay the groundwork for the implementation of these standards. I think there are commonsense ways we can and should make implementation go more smoothly. As Mike said, I think that the Common-- new assessments aligned to the Common Core will address one of the chief complaints of teachers and students alike, fill in the bubble tests. Because the Common Core requires children become problem solvers and good communicators, the new tests aligned to them will measure complex thinking, reading, writing, communications, and problem solving kids' skills. As a result, teachers will no longer be driven to narrow the curriculum or teach to a bad test. There have always been standards and always will be standards. There have always been tests and there always will be tests. It's time to get them right. For that reason, I ask you to ""Embrace the Common Core.""Thank you, Carmel Martin, speaking for the motion. And now, to speak against the motion in the final statement of the opening round, please welcome Rick Hess. He is a resident scholar and director of educational policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, author of several books on education including, ""Cage Busting Leadership."" Speaking against the motion, ""Embrace the Common Core."" Please welcome Rick Hess.It's a pleasure to be here with you this evening to talk about this issue. Notice that we-- I am not here to argue that the Common Core is malicious or atrocious. I am here to argue that we should not embrace it. Now, you might wonder why. I heard Mike try to recharacterize the Common Core as meaning that one is for standards, for high standards, and for great tests. Well, if that's the Common Core, then I'm for it, too. But that's actually not the Common Core. That is Mike trying to turn the Common Core into a vague principle that we like good stuff. Carmel talked about Janelle. I got to tell you, if you think there was any state in the Union, circa 2009, that said, ""It's state standards,"" or, ""It's okay to graduate high school as an illiterate,"" that's actually not the facts on the ground. The standards bear only a passing resemblance to what is asked of kids and what actually gets taught. But that's all kind of a distraction. There's a couple reasons that we should absolutely not embrace the Common Core. First, the Common Core does not solve the problem that it was designed to solve. The motivation behind the launch of the Common Core was what we called the ""race to the bottom,"" after No Child Left Behind, the concern that states were playing games with their test scores in order to make their schools look better than they were. Common Core was supposed to help address this. It doesn't. It doesn't because in order to get a lot of states to sign on, partly with the inducement of federal money, the advocates for the Common Core brutally compromised the design of the thing. Common Core allows every state to set its own cut score, so every state can decide what is or is not passing. The Smarter Balanced Consortium, one of the two federally funded testing consortia, gives states a 12-week testing window. They can decide where in a 12-week period during the spring they would like to test their kids. That means some states can have their kids get 50 percent more learning time than other states. This is a time-tested way to inflate your test scores. And only about 35 to 40 percent of students are actually going to be tested in the spring with the federally funded Common Core assessments. Other states have been bailing in droves, and we've now got a slew of states whipping up half-baked assessments for next spring that certainly aren't comparable and very likely may be lousier tests than the one they abandoned for the Common Core. So the bottom line is that Common Core actually not only doesn't solve the race to the bottom problem, it may actually aggravate it. Second issue going on here is a number of strident claims were made for the Common Core. We are told that the Common Core is evidence based. We are told that it's internationally benchmarked, that it's rigorous. Well, that evidence is about as disciplined as Mike's reference to the - - his assertion that every study over 30 years-- just no, you can't make statements like this. There are tens of thousands of studies conducted of United States education, and they don't all show anything. The idea that the Common Core is evidence based? Look, what they mean is the folks sitting on the committees that wrote the Common Core looked at some statistics on the kinds of high school courses that college kids take, and they looked at some surveys of employers and college professors. That's fine. That's good. I'm glad they did that. That's not evidence of what needs to be or not be in the Common Core. In fact, I'm not sure what kind of evidence one would point to, to prove that children need to learn to multiply fractions at this grade rather than that grade. Frankly, these are judgment calls which reasonable people can disagree on. Lynn Fuchs, professor at Vanderbilt, who's got no dog in the Common Core fight, has pointed out that there's no empirical basis for the Common Core, that we don't know yet whether it makes sense to have this particular set of standards or not. Internationally benchmarked? What they mean is that people on the committees writing the Common Core looked at some international standards, and they copied some, and they didn't copy others. The idea that the Common Core's more rigorous? Well, frankly, the Common Core ends high school math after algebra 2. Most state standards went beyond that. They included trigonometry and pre-calculus before the Common Core. Now, Mike and Carmel might say that they don't think that stuff's necessary or useful, but it's hard for somebody to convince me that these are undeniably more rigorous standards when we're jettisoning the last two years of mathematics. Now, this would all be interesting enough and a reason to maybe go slow, but there's another piece to the puzzle, which is that Common Core is actually not just about words on paper. It's also about theories of hypotheses about how kids will learn better. These hypotheses are baked into the Common Core, into the tests that have been designed to support the Common Core, and they have received shockingly little debate, given how radical they are. One is a fascination with what Common Core advocates called close reading. This is the idea that students ought to learn to read by deciphering the text-- preferably nonfiction, by deciphering the text without regard to other knowledge and without any personal reaction to the text. Now, I don't have a problem with close reading. It turns out when I taught high school two decades ago, I actually did a fair bit of this. But the idea that this is how every child at every grade level in every subject across an ocean ought to experience reading? I find that a radical proposition. Common Core embraces something called conceptual math. You may have seen some of the worksheets or the YouTube videos. This is the stuff that Carol was talking about, the idea that elementary children in particular ought to master math by learning the concepts, not just the arithmetic, and the best way to master these concepts is by composing and decomposing lots of these numbers in various drawing exercises. I don't have a problem with this as a way to teach kids math. I find it shocking that this should be the way all children of all performance levels across the nation ought to learn it. Third, the Common Core embraces something called informational text, informational reading. At the high school level it wants kids to read 70 percent informational text. It doesn't want to do this in English class, which is why we are now looking at children in chemistry classes, for instance, reading EPA reports. The idea that you are going to learn science more effectively by reading EPA reports than by doing lab is a radical proposition. In some, given that the Common Core doesn't solve the problem, it has been sold based on exaggerated claim and calls for major changes of a certain value, it seems to me reasonable not to embrace the darn thing. Thank you.Thank you, Rick Hess. And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. Debate, where our motion is, ""Embrace the Common Core."" Remember how you voted before the debate. I want to remind you again that after the debate you'll vote a second time and the team whose numbers have changed the most in your estimation in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. Now on to round two. Round two is where the debaters address one another in turn and they take questions from me and from you and the audience. But to remember where we are and where we've been, we have two teams against two, Carmel Martin and Mike Petrilli are arguing that you embrace the Common Core, thereby they're arguing for the motion. Their argument's saying, ""No,"" they're saying, ""The standards are not perfect."" They're saying, ""The implementation has had problems."" But they say that basically the idea is sound and the need is real, that our schools are mediocre, that they're letting down students, not allowing them to graduate in ways where they're prepared for college or the or the job world. They say that the testing issue is solvable. They say it makes no sense to go backwards at this point because of the chaos that would result. And finally they says “The Common Core standards are a crucial step forward for American education”. The team arguing against the motion, Carol Burris and Rick Hess arguing that you do not embrace the Common Core. They agree that the standards are not perfect and then some. Their argument is that the standards disregard decades of research on child development, on how children learn. That in the testing, children are being presented with questions of such obscurity that it makes them cry. They say that it’s, when the claim that their raising the standard is bogus, when they’re doing things like jettisoning the last two years of mathematics. And they finally come down with this, that there is no evidence that the standards actually will lead to improvements in student achievement. So, I want to look at a lot of this and slice it up. But there’s one point that I want to get to early in this. Given that a lot of the controversy about this debate has been of a political nature, I heard the opposition make an argument based on substance, which I welcome. Nevertheless, it’s a very political hot potato with the accusation being made that the Common Core was designed in secret by a small cabal of people directed by Bill Gates and by the Obama Administration. Your opponent Carmel Martin, who to some degree was defending against this. You didn’t make that argument at all. I just want to know, do you concede her point? Do you take the point that it was a state thing and on the charges that this is a top down Obama Administration program is one that you concede to that side?I would say yes and no. You know, certainly they weren’t conceived in secret, but they were conceived by a very, very small group of people who were predominantly non- educators. And the input happened after the fact. Certainly as an educator, I had really no awareness of any of this going on and I stay very current. Until 2010, and then everything was presented in one fell swoop. Certainly the president has made it very clear that he is supportive of the Common Core standards but mostly what happened was Race to the Top. And that was a federal program. And if you look at some of the writings and went back to 2008, as the Governors Association were talking about this, they were actually saying these are the kinds of incentives that we need.Carol, remind people what race to the top was.Right, Race to the Top was a stimulus program that came into effect shortly after President Obama was elected president. The whole idea behind Race to the Top was that there were going to have to be radical changes in schools, adoption of Common Core standards or something similar., testing programs, evaluation of teachers by test scores, and other things. And in order to get the money and we all desperately needed the money, states very, very quickly put together applications.Okay, let me take that to your opponent. I guess we will touch somewhat on the politics of this. I’m going to take this back to Carmel Martin between you responded to this in your opening statement. We’re hearing Carol Burris saying that de facto, the fact that the administration offered prizes, financial prizes to schools, partly for adopting common standards, does suggest that that this was a federally steered, to some degree federally steered effort.Well, I would say again, this was an effort that was underway before President Obama was President Obama. It was led by a democratic and republican governor from very diverse states. They had the support of virtually again, Sarah Palin and Rick Perry don’t support much, but the other 48 governors were strongly supportive of it. And the Obama administration supported an initiative that was state led, that was driven from, I would argue, bottom up, not top down. And I think what we need to keep in mind though, is even if--we’ll never know how many states would have adopted the standards but for the incentives provided by the federal government. But then the question before us right now is, given that it was something that was developed, through I would argue, contrary to Carol, through a very rigorous process. It brought teachers into the process. It brought the public into the process. And then once each state adopted it, there was process at the state level around the standards. So, then the question before us is, are the standards good for our students? And Mike and I think it is.Okay, and we will come to that question. I want to see if we want to do one more round on the political issue. Rick Hess, if you want to respond to what Carmel said.Yes, I think first off, Carmel is playing, her characterization of the timeline is I think loose-- what the governors supported in 2008 was the exploration of the idea of making some standards more common. I think most folks, in 2009, 2010, imagine there were maybe a dozen or 15 states that were, themselves, ready, unprovoked, to move forward and explore the Common Core. In fact, Mike, I'd like to hear your take, because you, for instance, have said that the federal government has been heavy-handed with Common Core and deserves to be chastened. In fact, you have encouraged Oklahoma governor Mary Fallin to sue--Rick Hess----the Secretary of Education.I just want to remind you to pull your papers under the mic, because--I'm sorry.--we lose you a little bit when you turn away--My apologies.Why don't you-- why don't you rephrase the question again, just so the radio audience gets to hear it?Sure. No. Absolutely. My apologies for that. Mike, I'm curious on your response to Carmel, given that you have previously testified to the Indiana State Senate that the federal government has been heavy-handed with this reform and deserves to be chastened. And that you have, in fact, said that you hope the Oklahoma Governor, Mary Fallin, sues the U.S. Secretary of Education because not through race to the top, but through waivers from No Child Left Behind-- you said, ""Nothing gives a secretary of education the authority to push states around when it comes to those standards.""Okay. Mike, you got to hear the question twice. Extra time to think about it.I did. Yes. And it had a question mark at the end. That was good. Yes. Absolutely. And if we were here to debate the federal role in education, I would move over there. Maybe Carol would be over here. I'm not sure. But we are here to debate----to debate the Common Core, right? It is true. Look, the-- I think everybody is in agreement. I wrote an article recently with a strong opponent of the Common Core. We wrote together. Here are the facts. It started out as a state-led initiative. And then the Obama Administration came in and endorsed it. There's no doubt that it had a big impact in the number of states that got involved. And in my opinion, we would all be much better off if the federal government would now butt out. So, Carmel, maybe you can share that view with the Secretary of Education.All right. Let's move on. Let's stipulate that this side feels that this was not top-down, that it was-- it started with the states. This side feels it's murkier than that. I want to move on now to the substance of the arguments that were made. And I want to take to this side the very strong charge made by your opponent, Carol Burris-- I want to take it to the side arguing to embrace the Common Core. Carol Burris's statement that there is no evidence that these standards actually will result in achievement. What's the evidence--Well, I would say--Carmel Martin.--it's early to judge the implementation of the standards.But that's not the question. The question is, where is the evidence--I understand that.--supporting them?I would-- but I would say, although it's early, we do see some signs of success. And I would point to Kentucky, which was one of the first states to adopt the Common Core. And in--Carmel, can I stop you? Only because of time limits, that I think the sense of the question is that when they were put together, prior to their implementation, that there was no evidence that they were-- they were based on no evidence that they would work, as opposed to how they've done--Well----since then. I think--Okay.--that was your point?Yes.Yep. Okay.Well, I mean, I think that's just factually inaccurate. I think that the folks who got together to draft the new standards relied very heavily on the existing research that they had about what children needed to be able to do and what set of knowledge they needed to have to be successful in college and in good jobs. They brought in the people from the post-secondary sector, something that hadn't been done in K-12 education historically, which really is pretty illogical that that hadn't been done before. They brought in people from the business community to talk about what skills they needed their employees to have. They brought in content experts. They showed the standards to the associations that represent teachers in mathematics and English language arts. And they took in their input. I think neither Mike nor I would say that each and every standard is perfect. But I think if you look at the process that was used in the development of these standards and compare--Okay.--it to the process that was used under the old standards by most states, that it was very rigorous, and they did look at evidence. And you can--Okay.--disagree, but they did look at evidence.Carol Burris, have you been refuted on this point?No. I-- the truth of the matter is, one of the things that's very different about the Common Core that I spoke about, is unlike the old Massachusetts standards, the standards in New York-- which really just identify what kids should know at grade levels-- the Common Core standards create-- or contain what's called instructional shifts in practice. Six in ELA and six inELA?English language arts. Thank you. For example, the whole idea that it makes sense for young children to engage in close reading-- there is absolutely no evidence that that's the case. At the high school level, yes. But not at the elementary level. There was no real research that was based on yanking up lexile levels. We know from years of developmental reading research that kids do best when they read independently with leveled readers. But the Common Core says no. The Common Core says predominant reading should be on what is considered to be grade level, which has just been increased. And if the kids don't get it, well, the teachers should read it aloud. Well, let me tell you something. You learned how to ride your bicycle by riding your bicycle. You didn't learn how to ride your bicycle by having your dad never taking his hands off the bar.Mike-- let's let Mike Petrilli respond.Yeah, and I'm so glad that you raised this, a couple times, this idea of close reading. And I spent the big part of the weekend talking to some reading experts getting ready for this question, and I think I have a better understanding. It's going to get a little weedy, but I'll get through it very fast. And it's this. We've had a system for years where we've said, ""Okay, if a child can only read at the first-grade level and they're in fifth grade, we're going to give them first-grade level books, right, with the hope that over time they would get better. The problem is there's five or six rigorous studies showing by and large those kids were never getting better at reading. And that they're-- what the studies showed is what you really need to do is find ways to get the kids to read more challenging texts at their grade level, which means at first-- and the teachers today helped explain this so, so much better than I could-- that the teachers start by reading it aloud, having the kids follow along. They do what they call, ""scaffolding,"" over time. And over time, they start to teach the kids how to do this reading so that they can let go of the handlebar and they can ride the bike on their own. And kids who are way behind grade level, including kids who are special education students, are never going to make progress if we don't challenge them with those grade level texts. This is what the evidence says, and the Common Core looks at the evidence.Rick Hess. Rick Hess to respond. He's wisely letting the applause die down before he speaks.Yeah. Mike, I hate to step on the applause line, but actually I think you conflated two things. You conflated close reading and Lexile. These are not the same thing.What's a Lexile?A lexile is gauging how complicated a piece of reading is-- a piece of literature. Look, close reading is a particular theory of how kids should read. David Coleman, president of the college board, the lead writer on the English Language Arts Standard, liked to talk about close reading as teaching kids to read like a detective and write like a journalist. Frankly, I think that sounds perfectly fine as one piece of how we teach children to read. I don't think that I'm a particular fan of the idea that every child in America from grades K to 12 ought to learn to write like a journalist.Right, but Rick, is that actually in the standards? Do the standards say that? No. What the standards say is that children need to read at grade level proficiently.Well, Mike, wait a minute. This is, I think, the degree of ambiguity in the Common Core that drives a lot of people crazy, that at one level the Common Core is just a bunch of innocuous words on paper, you know, one of the eighth grade reading standards, ""Compare and contrast the structure of two or more texts and analyze how the deferring structure of each text contributes to its meaning and style."" This isn't very different from what most states previously had. These are a bunch of pleasant words on paper. I have no particular objection to them. The significance of the Common Core is that the advocates for the Common Core and the people who are designing the test talk very explicitly about, as Carol said, these instructional shifts, which have not been publicly debated, which got little public airing as 40-odd states rushed to adopt the Common Core in 2009, 2010, and which portend a dramatic shift in how we teach 50 million children reading and math.All right.I'm not sure these are bad things, but I sure as heck think we ought to find out more before we embrace them.But when there is evidence--Mike Petrilli.--as we have now in early reading-- there was evidence 20 years ago on phonics-- on phonemic awareness, that was finally incorporated into our schools-- now we have good evidence that these level texts, just having kids who are fifth graders reading first grade texts over and over again, has not been working. Now we have that evidence. It's time to follow the evidence. And that's what Common Core does. Not every point has that, but where there is evidence-- we know that calculator use in the first grade, not a good idea. The Common Cores says we should not be using calculators till the kids get older. These are dramatically more evidence based than the standards that came before.Hang on one second. Carol Burris.Yeah. I think it's really easy for you to say, Mike, ""Well, this is what the evidence shows."" I guess what I'm going to say to you is, ""Show me the evidence,"" because what I-- Common Core is wrong about literacy in many ways, okay? in 2013 has pointed out test complexity is based on the erroneous notion that we must ramp up test difficulty beginning in third grade in order to achieve college and career readiness. Kylene Beers and Robert Probst-- these are university professors in reading, their excellent book, Notice and Note, worries that text dependent questions in close reading will lead to student disengagement in reading. Piano, 2013, has shown that the elimination of work-play stations may harm the development of oral language so vital for these learners. These are all people in the research community and in schools saying, ""This does not work."" I have never--All right, Carol, let----seen the evidence that level checks do not work.That's exactly the question I wanted to take to Mike. Your response to thisYeah, yeah, no. Well, I will be happy to go find it for you after this debate. I don't have it with me. But, look, here's the question--But you're confident that it exists?I-- no, I'm absolutely confident. Look, this has been the dominant way we have taught reading now for decades. And you look at our achievement in reading, and it is mostly flat. And you look at our achievement in reading for special education kids, for kids who are behind, and what you find is that they are not making progress fast enough. We've done better in math where we've made greater progress, particularly for poor kids, but in reading it's been slow. We've made some progress in teaching early reading because of phonics and phonemic awareness because there we finally followed the evidence.All right.And what I'm saying is that we need to follow the evidence. The Common Core is saying that's what we need to do, follow the evidence. Kids deserve to be challenged. The teachers I talk to today, you know-- I mean, Carol's argument earlier-- the four words, ""These are too hard,"" right?All right, let me-- Mike, let me-- I want to move on to-- in terms of evidence, earlier when the question of evidence came up, Carmel Martin, you started talking about the evidence so far in places where it has been implemented, how it's doing, and I cut you off because we weren't at that point.Yeah.I want to hear now, what's the evidence that it's working in places where it's in place?Well, first, I just want to finish Mike's thought there. I mean, when we talked to teachers today, they acknowledge that when the standards were first brought to their schools, they were concerned that they would be too hard for their children, but we heard things like reports that teachers said, ""Wow, I didn't think they'd be able to do it and they are,"" and talk about the joy that they've had in seeing their children meet that challenge. And I have to say, as a former civil rights attorney, it just makes me very nervous when people talk about how, you know, you need to--Okay.--some kids can't reach the same expectations as other kids.All right, all right.Can I jump in?Yeah, I want to let Carol Burris respond.I am the last person on the planet that would ever say, ""Some kids can't."" I run an integrated high school, 16 percent of our kids are on free or reduced price lunch, and every one of them tomorrow who are 12th graders will walk into an international baccalaureate English class. So, that's-- this is not about it being hard, it's about it being wrong. That's what it's about. It's about it being appropriate.Carmel, do you want to respond to that point before we move on?Yeah.Please do.Yeah, like I said earlier the point-- the example that Carol made about being able to count to one-- to 100 in ones and tens, I know lots of five-year olds who can do that. And I think that if we ask children coming from all different backgrounds to be able to do that, they'll be able to do that. And, you know, I think that we have lots of evidence that we're-- what we're asking them to do under the old standards wasn't working, that--Let me-- let me bring a question to your opponents because it's something about your opening statements that I either didn't understand or confused me. It sounded-- I felt I was hearing a mixed message. I was hearing from you, Carol, ""These standards are too high,"" for kids in kindergarten. And I was hearing from Rick, ""These standards are too low,"" and I'm not sure which way you're going on this. Rick, do you want to take it, or Carol?I'd be happy to take it. It's not a matter of too high or too low, it's a matter of silly and not right. For example, in the early grades, there are a lot of standards that are not developmentally appropriate, but then when you go up to the high school level, which Rick was talking about-- I mean, I was talking with my math teachers today. We have to implement Common Core geometry. Well, what does it do? It's a whole different course in geometry based on constructions. Well, it worked out really well for the early Greeks, but it is not an effective strategy today. We actually tried it in our school a couple years ago in anticipation of the Common Core, and the kids were lost. Trigonometry has been stripped out of the algebra 2 class. Since I went to school back in, I hate to admit it, the 1960s, trigonometry was part of the course of studies in high school. Common Core has changed it. It's not algebra 2. So the problems that you hear is not, ""It's too hard,"" or, ""It's too soft,"" it's just not right at a variety of levels.Okay, and I want to take-- I want to move to that-- and so your point being it's wonky in many ways?Yes.Fair enough. It can be wonky in many ways, and your point would hold up. I want to take to Mike Petrilli because you were talking in your opening statement about the nature of testing. And you were saying that there's-- ""I sense a technology of testing that's better than it used to be.""Right.Testing is one of the things that parents are most upset about. Not only are they confused about the work that they’re doing, they’re very, very upset about the testing processes. What is your response to those parents?Right, is that their concerns are very well founded, as are the concerns of many educators who have been complaining for years, decades now, that the tests we’ve been using to judge schools are not well designed. And they’re right. Those tests by and large have been very inexpensive tests. They’ve been set at a low level. They’ve been fill in the blank. And now we finally have this opportunity to move to much better tests with the Common Core, that are under development, that are coming this spring for the very first time in about half of the country. And this is our opportunity to now address many of those concerns. And for example, these tests will have a lot more writing on them than most of the other tests had. It’s very hard to test kids’ critical thinking skills if it’s just multiple choice. Right, certainly hard to test their writing skills. Yet a state like Georgia has been trying to get by with a test that costs eight dollars per kid and therefore doesn’t have any writing on it. And what we’re trying to do here is to turn that page. And say look, there were major problems with the test under the No Child Left Behind era. We’ve heard those concerns and now we’re trying to get something better, something that I think that Carol and Rick have supported in the past.I’d appreciate it if Rick, if you want to step in, because we haven’t heard from you in a bit. And you look like you’re steaming over there. If you want to defer to your partner, please do.No, I always look that way. Two thoughts, one on testing and one just on the prior question. One, you know John, one way to think about this is it’s really we’re debating embrace the Common Core. Again I’m not declaring the Common Core to be atrocious or malicious. I am suggesting that the standard of proof for the Common Core is much higher than for old state standards. Massachusetts had had state standards in place for 18 years, give or take. Those standards had produced substantial and sustained improvements in student learning. If what Mike and Carmel had been advocating for, was taking these standards whose tires we’ve kicked for 15 or more years, and taking those national, I would have been very open to that. The idea that we have a bunch of design hypotheses about what kids should know, we think, maybe, and how they should learn it, maybe. The idea that we want to roll this out for 50 million children with little opportunity to see how this plays out or what it means, leaves me remarkably nervous. So for me-- So, for me it’s less about too high or too low. I think frankly we just don’t know. On the testing point, I mean, like I said at the beginning, I’m with Mike. I’m for good tests. I’m anti-bad tests. Mike and I are on the same page here. But I think the notion that the Common Core tests are good is an open question.Okay I want to remind you that we are in a question and answer section of this Intelligence squared US debate. I’m John Donvan your moderator and we have four debaters, two teams of two, debating this motion, embrace the Common Core. Let’s go to some audience questions. Again if you raise your hand and wait, a microphone will be brought down to you and we’d like you to stand up. And hold the mic about fist distance from your mouth for good broadcast quality right in the center there. And if you stand up, a mic will find you. Coming, it’s coming from your right hand side. So really nice, tight, do me proud, good question.Hi, My name is Nareda and I’m not a teacher or an educator. I’m actually Janelle. I went to Smith College and then later to Oxford University and my first year at Smith was tough. So my question is about the next generation learning tests. How do or do not, how do they measure critical thinking skills, with the caveat that PISA, the countries that score the highest in PISA are using multiple choice straight answer tests?Let me ask you if you could rephrase your question in a way that lets him convince you to embrace the Common Core. So, are you saying are these next generation tests the key, the secret, are they going to save it?I want to know more about them. Exactly, we want next generation exams that are no longer simple to answer. But how do they actually, what role do they play in actually measuring critical thinking skills and developing them so that we have a standard?Can I rephrase your question to be--Yeah.Tell us why these next generation tests are working and why therefore we should embrace the Common Core. That’s the gist of your question?Exactly that.Okay. Carmel Martin.I would say the Common Core standards very much drive towards teaching and assessment that is focused on creating problem solvers and good communicators, those kinds of skills. And we heard just today from a group of teachers that we talked to, that under the new assessments, they can’t teach to the tests anymore, because the tests are no longer about rote memorization. It’s about children being able to make inferences and digest the texts, so I think it goes exactly to the point that you mentioned. The crafters of the Common Core did look at at PISA. They also looked at Massachusetts and they did borrow from places where they thought it was working, as well as looking into the evidence, so I think it really tackles the issue that you're talking about very effectively. And I think assessments aligned to those kinds of standards should really help us move away from a mode of rote memorization towards teaching in an enriched way.Carol Burris.I think it's always helpful to have an example. Here's what's called the Research Simulation Task. The Research Simulation Task-- this is from PARCC-- is an assessment component worthy of student preparation because it asks students to exercise the career and college readiness skills of observation, deduction, and proper use and evaluation of evidence across text types. In this test, students will analyze an informational topic presented through several articles, multimedia stimuli, the first text being an anchor text. Students will engage with the text by answering a series of questions and synthesizing information from multiple sources in order to write two analytic essays. I think that sounds great. Grade 3. That was Grade 3. You know what? If kids can do that at the end of Grade 3, I can retire. Just give them calculus in fourth grade and send all those Doogie Howsers off to college.Another question?Kelly Posner-Gerstenhaber, Columbia University. Now, we all know that every child deserves the right education, but many think tanks and thought leaders talk about one of the most critical issues in our nation is-- is talent development. And the future of our country actually depends on not ignoring them anymore. And by the way, the low-income high achieving kid is probably the most underserved kid in our nation. It's been said that--But I need-- I need you to----zero into your question.--I'm getting there. In states where there's--No. No. I need you to get there right now.Right. I'm getting there right now. In states that are doing better, Common Core is actually going to bring them down. So I was wondering what you thought, how Common Core actually addresses the needs of this underserved group.Carmel Martin.Sure. I would say there have been analysis compari","cornell-intelligence-squared-debates"

"t1_crv9gqz","I think you're overestimating the power of the President to harm those businesses.First, the President does not have dictatorial control over the government.  The scope of what a President can do without the assistance of Congress is a great deal more limited than you'd imagine.  Especially when Congress may be openly hostile to the President's agenda, and pass laws via veto override that stop the President.Second, the President's power to effectuate his agenda can be more limited than you realize, even if he has the lawful authority to do so.  For instance, Obama has had a very hard time getting immigration and customs officers to go along with executive orders around deferred action and low priority cases, because as long as the statute allows the officers discretion, Obama can't micromanage them to make them use the discretion how he wants.  In Sanders' case, he won't be able to change the fact that mid-level investigative staff at the SEC are all angling for industry jobs.Third, even with the force of the government behind his policies, there are limits on the government's power to regulate.  The 5th Amendment precludes seizure of property, and a number of treaties the US is party to (WTO, Basel, NAFTA) set limits on regulations.  Plus there's the courts general aversion to very skewed schemes.  A 90% federal tax rate combined with California's over 10% state tax rate would mean over a 100% top marginal tax rate overall.  I think there's a good case that federal courts would toss that as being too high, and constituting a 5th amendment taking.","cornell-change-my-view"

"t1_ces8zuw","Here's why you need to neuter your cat:1. Unaltered cats have a hormonal urge to roam in search of mates. When your tom gets the urge, he will do his damndest to bolt out the front door and into oncoming traffic. At best, your cat will impregnate another cat and create litters and litters of unwanted kittens. At worst, your cat will die because he was hit by a car. At even worse than that, your cat will get hit by a car, and not quite die, but cost you either hundreds of dollars to be put down, or thousands of dollars of surgery.2. Unaltered toms spray. Your cat hasn't discovered the couch yet, but eventually he will, and his piss will cause an eye-watering stench in your home. It's fucking gross, dude.3. Unaltered toms also have an increased risk of kidney disease. When cats have kidney problems, they become averse to the litter box, and start peeing all over the house. Sometimes, that urine is also bloody. Oh yeah, and kidney disease can kill your cat.4. Millions of cats are put down every year. Letting your cat breed freely only contributes dozens of more cats every year to this death pool. Neuter one cat, prevent hundreds of cats from being killed during the course of one lifetime.5. Neutered toms need fewer calories in their diet. You actually save money on pet food in the long run by neutering him.6. Cats, as much as I love them, are a disaster for birds. Hawaii used to be a paradise of birds. Then settlers brought rats and cats with them. Now a lot of native bird species are extinct or critically endangered. That's an extreme example, but studies estimate that cats kill billions of birds in the US every year https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cats-kill-more-one-billion-birds-each-yearRESOURCES     from BestFriends.org http://bestfriends.org/What-we-do/Our-Work/Spay---Neuter/     from ASPCA http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/cat-care/spay-neuterobligatory [cat picture](http://i.imgur.com/RMS8ASx.jpg).","cornell-change-my-view"
